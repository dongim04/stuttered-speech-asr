0,441-128982-0000.flac," when the little fleet of spanish vessels, including the one which had been captured by bartholomey portuguese and his men, were on their way to campichi, they met with very stormy weather so that they were separated, and the ship which contained bartholomey and his companions arrived first at the port for which they were bound."
1,441-128982-0002.flac," for as they were all very able-bodied men, they would be extremely useful on a ship. but when his vessel was safely mored, and it became known in the town that he had a company of pirates on board,"
2,441-128982-0007.flac," but he did not lose heart and immediately set to work to free himself from his irons, which were probably very clumsy affairs. at last, carrying little how much he scratched and tore his skin,"
3,441-128982-0004.flac," and who ought immediately to be delivered up to the civil authorities. this proposal, however, met with no favor from the spanish captain, who had found bartholomey a very quiet man, and could see that he was a very strong one."
4,441-128982-0027.flac, and he had no wine jars now with which to boy himself up.
5,441-128982-0031.flac," and who began to rub a crowbar on a stone in order to reduce it to the proper size. by thalami carefully knocked all the nails out of the board, and then finding a large flat stone, he rubbed down one of them until he had formed it into the shape of a rude knife blade."
6,441-128982-0034.flac," gathering up his legs so as to keep out of reach of the alligators, and with a long pole pushed himself off from shore. sometimes paddling and sometimes pushing his pole against the bottom, he at last got across the river and took up his journey upon dry land."
7,441-128982-0001.flac," the captain, who had bartholomey and the others in charge, did not know what an important capture he had made. he supposed that these pirates were ordinary buccaneers, and it appears that it was his intention to keep them as his own private prisoners."
8,441-128982-0006.flac," when this dignitary heard the story, he immediately sent a party of officers to the ship and commanded the captain to deliver the pirate leader into their charge. the other men were left where they were."
9,441-128982-0012.flac," this came soon after nightfall. a man descended with a lantern to see that the prisoner was still secure. let us hope that it was not the soldier who had kindly informed him of his fate, and as soon as he was fairly in the hold bartholomew sprang upon him."
10,441-128982-0010.flac," and he did not know how to swim, which seems a strange failing in a hardy sailor with so many other nautical accomplishments. in the roughhold where he was shut up, our pirate peering about, anxious and earnest."
11,441-128982-0017.flac," which was what he wished to do. if the hound should get upon his trail, he was a lost man. the desperate pirate, therefore, determined to give the bloodhounds no chance to follow him, and for three days he remained in a marshy forest, in the dark recesses of which he could hide."
12,441-128982-0021.flac," and this sight, doubtless, animated him very much during the first part of his journey. the terrible trials and hardships which bartholomew experienced during his trample on the coast were such as could have been endured only by one of the strongest and toughest of men."
13,441-128982-0014.flac," for moment he sank below the surface, but the two airtight jars quickly rose and bore him up with them. there was a bustle onboard the ship. there was some random firing of muskets in the direction of the splashing which the watch had heard."
14,441-128982-0025.flac," the animals might howl around him and glared him with their shining eyes, and the alligators might lash the water into foam with their great tails."
15,441-128982-0019.flac," and sometimes he saw at night distant torches, which he were sure were carried by men who were hunting for him. but at last the pursuit seemed to be given up, and hearing no more dogs and seeing no more flickering lights, bartholome left the marsh and set out on his long journey down the coast."
16,441-128982-0015.flac," but none of the balls struck the pirate or his jaws, and he soon floated out of sight and hearing. kicking out with his legs and paddling as well as he could with one hand while he held on to the jaws with the other, he at last managed to reach the land."
17,441-128982-0032.flac," which he made as sharp as he could. then, with these tools, he undertook the construction of a raft, working away like a beaver and using the sharpened nails instead of his teeth."
18,441-128982-0013.flac," there was a fierce struggle, but the pirate was quick and powerful, and the sentinel was soon dead. then, carrying his two jars, bartholomey climbed swiftly and noiselessly up the short ladder."
19,441-128982-0008.flac," he succeeded in getting rid of his fetters and could move about as freely as a tiger in a cage. to get out of this cage was bartholome's first object. it would be comparatively easy, because in the course of time someone would come into the hold."
20,441-128982-0033.flac," he cut down a number of small trees, and when he had enough of these slender trunks, he bound them together with reeds and ozures, which he found on the riverbank. so, after infinite labor and trial, he constructed a raft which would bear him on the surface of the water."
21,441-128982-0005.flac," and he did not at all desire to give up such a valuable addition to his crew. but the merchant grew very angry, for he knew that bartholome had inflicted great injury on spanish commerce, and as the captain would not listen to him, he went to the governor of the town and reported the case."
22,441-128982-0030.flac," bartholomey perceived an old board in which there was some long and heavy rusty nails. greatly encouraged by this discovery, the indefatigable traveler set about a work which resembled that of the old woman who wanted a needle."
23,441-128982-0024.flac, although he could hear the roars and screams of wild beasts all about him. anyone who was afraid to go down into a dark cellar to get some apples from a barrel at the foot of the stairs can have no idea of the sort of mind possessed by bartholomey portuguese.
24,441-128982-0029.flac," now a piece of good fortune happened to him, although to an ordinary traveler it might have been considered a matter of no importance, whatever. on the edge of the shore, where it had floated down from some region higher up the river,"
25,441-128982-0003.flac, and who had heard of his various exploits. he therefore went to the captain of the vessel and informed him that he had on board one of the very worst pirates in the whole world whose wicked deeds were well known in various parts of the west indies.
26,441-128982-0016.flac, and ran as fast as he could into the dark woods beyond the town. bartholome was now greatly in fear that when his escape was discovered he would be tracked by bloodhounds.
27,441-128982-0018.flac," and where the water which covered the ground prevented the dogs from following his scent. he had nothing to eat except a few roots of water plants, but he was accustomed to probation, and these kept him alive. often he heard the hounds baying on the dry land adjoining the marsh."
28,441-128982-0035.flac," even if he could not walk. no athlete of the present day, no matter if he should be a most accomplished circus man, could reasonably expect to perform the feat which this bold pirate successfully accomplished. for five or six leagues he went through that mangrove forest."
29,441-128982-0028.flac, but a man in his situation would not be likely to give up readily.
30,441-128982-0009.flac," and the athletic bugger near thought that he could easily get the better of whoever might open the hatch. but the next act in this truly melodramatic performance would be a great deal more difficult. for an order to escape from the ship, it would be absolutely necessary for bartholomew to swim to shore."
31,441-128982-0026.flac," this was a wide river flowing through the inland country into the sea. he made his way up the shore of this river for considerable distance, but it grew but little narrower, and he could see no chance of getting across. he could not swim."
32,441-128982-0020.flac," which was forty leagues away, but where he had reason to suppose he would find some friends. when he came out from among the trees, he mounted a small hill and looked back upon the town. the public square was lighted, and there in the middle of it he saw the gallows which had been erected for his execution."
33,441-128982-0036.flac," never once setting his foot upon the ground, by which his mint mud water and roots. but swinging himself by his hands and arms from branch to branch as if he had been a great ape, only resting occasionally, drawing himself upon a stout limb where he might sit for a while and get his breath."
34,441-128982-0023.flac," when he had made for himself what seemed to be a free passage, he would dash in and hurry across. at other times, great forests stretched down to the very coast, and through these he was obliged to make his way."
35,441-128982-0011.flac," he was satisfied that this unwieldy contrivance would support him in the water. among other things he had found in his remodeling about the hold was an old knife, and with this in his hand he now sat waiting for a good opportunity to attack his sentinel."
36,441-128982-0022.flac," but after a diet of roots, shellfish must have been a very agreeable change, and they gave him all the strength and vigor he needed. very often he found streams and inlets, which he was obliged to ford."
37,441-130108-0023.flac, the troops sifting through the forest were sullen. in the youth's company once amends laugh-ring out. a dozen soldiers turned their faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure.
38,441-130108-0030.flac, nobody seems to know where we go or why we go. we just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here and get licked there. and nobody knows what it's done for. it makes a man feel like a damn kitten in a bag.
39,441-130108-0003.flac," always the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and left, and the den on the right had grown to frightful proportions. the guns were roaring without an instant's pause for breath."
40,441-130108-0037.flac," the day had grown more white, until the sun shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest. a sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward that part of the line where lay the youth's regiment. the french shifted a trifle to meet it squarely."
41,441-130108-0032.flac, and then we begin to fight and the rebs had an easy time of it. don't tell me it's just luck. i know better. it's this darned old... the friend seemed jaded. but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of calm confidence.
42,441-130108-0017.flac," but still, still we don't have no luck. well then, if we fight like the devil and don't ever whip, it must be the general's fault,"" said the youth, grandly and decisively."
43,441-130108-0009.flac," the disordered, hurrying lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields. they were yelling, shrill and exultant. at this site, the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged. he exploded in loud sentences."
44,441-130108-0012.flac," he presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the commander of the forces. maybe at what null he is fault, not altogether."
45,441-130108-0024.flac," the noise of firing dogged their footsteps. sometimes it seemed to be driven a little way, but it always returned again with increased insolence. the men muttered and cursed, throwing black looks in its direction."
46,441-130108-0031.flac," now, i'd like to know what the eternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow. unless it was to give the rebs a regular pot shot at us. we came in here and got our legs all tangled up in these custom briars."
47,441-130108-0040.flac," the battle-roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a single long explosion. in the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men."
48,441-130108-0004.flac, it seemed that the canon had come from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous wrangle. it became impossible to make a sentence heard. the youth wished to launch a joke. a quotation from newspapers. he desired to say.
49,441-130108-0034.flac," at this time there was an interposition by the savage-minded left-tenant, who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his men. you boy shut right up!"
50,441-130108-0026.flac," increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets, it broke forth into prolonged peelings. the woods began to crackle as if a fire."
51,441-130108-0005.flac," all quiet on the rapahannock, but the guns refused to permit even a comment upon their uproar. he never successfully concluded the sentence, but at last the guns stopped and among the men in the rifle pits rumors again flew."
52,441-130108-0015.flac," but no one questioned his right to deal in such words, and presently he recovered his air of courage. he went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning. the brigadier said he never saw a new regiment fight the way we fought yesterday, didn't he?"
53,441-130108-0019.flac," the speech pierced the youth. inwardly he was reduced to an abject pelt by these chants' words. his legs quaked privately. he cast a frightened glance at the sarcastic man. why, i know, he hastened to say in a conciliating voice."
54,441-130108-0007.flac," stories of disaster were born into their minds with many proofs. this din of musketry on the right, growing like a released genie of sound, expressed and emphasized the army's plight. the men were disheartened and began to mutter."
55,441-130108-0014.flac," don't we do all that men can?"" demanded the youth loudly. he was secretly dumbfounded at this sentiment when it came from his lips. for a moment his face lost its baller, and he looked guiltily about him."
56,441-130108-0022.flac, he became suddenly a modest person. there was low-toned talk among the troops. the officers were impatient and snappy. their countenance is clouded with the tales of misfortune.
57,441-130108-0018.flac, and i don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting yet always losing through some darned old lung head of a general.
58,441-130108-0010.flac," observed a man. his friend, recently aroused, was still very drowsy. he looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement. then he sighed. oh well, i suppose we got licked."
59,441-130108-0008.flac," and it could always be seen that they would be wielded by the alleged news and could not fully comprehend a defeat. before the grey mist had been totally obliterated by the sunrays, the regiment was marching in a spread column that was retiring carefully through the woods."
60,441-130108-0011.flac," he remarked sadly. the youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men. he made an attempt to restrain himself, but the words upon his tongue were too bitter."
61,441-130108-0033.flac," oh, that devil at will! you always talk like a dog-hanged person. don't tell me. i know."
62,441-130108-0002.flac, he could see the low line of trenches but for a short distance. a few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills.
63,441-130108-0028.flac, who were lying down behind whatever protection they had collected. a battery had trundle into position in the rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance. the regiment unmoleasted as yet.
64,441-130108-0006.flac," like birds, but they were now for the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope. the men's faces grew doleful from the interpreting of omens."
65,441-130108-0013.flac," ""'it's our luck to get licked off and,' said his friend in a weary tone. he was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been cained and kicked. well, don't we fight like the devil?'"
66,441-130108-0001.flac," this part of the world let us strange, battleful existence. the youth's regiment was marched to relieve a command that had lain long in some damp trenches. the men took positions behind a curving line of rifle pits that had been turned up like a large furrow."
67,441-130108-0041.flac," they were worn, exhausted, having slept but little and labored much."
68,441-130108-0036.flac," less talking and more fighting is what's best for you boys. i never saw such gablin jackasses. he paused, ready to pounce upon any man who might have the temerity to reply."
69,441-130108-0038.flac," there was a weight. in this part of the field, they passed slowly the intense moments that preceded the tempest. a single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment. in an instant it was joined by many others."
70,441-130108-0020.flac," i don't think i fought the whole battle yesterday. but the others seemed innocent of any deeper meaning. apparently he had no information. it was merely his habit. oh, he replied in the same tone of calm division."
71,441-130108-0027.flac," set a man, here we are! everybody fightin' blood and destruction!"
72,441-130108-0025.flac," in a clear space, the troops were at last halted. regiments and brigades, broken and detached through their encounters with thickets, grew together again and lines were faced towards the pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry."
73,441-130108-0039.flac," there was a mighty song of clashes and crashes that went sweeping through the woods. the guns in the rear are roused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burly at them, suddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band of guns."
74,441-130108-0035.flac, you've been drawing like a lot of old hens.
75,441-130108-0029.flac," awaited the moment when the grey shadows of the woods before them should be slushed by the lines of flame. there was much growling and swearing. good god, the youth grumbled. we're always being chased around like rats. it makes me sick."
76,441-130108-0016.flac," in his reply, the friend's voice was stern. a chorus not, he said."
77,441-130108-0021.flac," the youth, nevertheless, felt a threat. his mind shrank from going near to the danger, and thereafter he was silent. the significance of the sarcastic man's words took from him all loud moods that would make him appear prominent."
78,441-130108-0000.flac," a sputtering of musketry was always to be heard. later, the cannon had entered the dispute. in the fog-filled air, the voices made a thudding sound. the reverberations were continual."
79,441-128988-0029.flac," when this message was received by the dignified official who filled the post of governor of cuba, he stormed and fairly foamed at the mouth, to be utterly foiled and discomfitted by this resurrected pirate."
80,441-128988-0033.flac," consequently, it was represented to the governor that his plan of vengeance would work most disastrously for the spanish settlers. for the buccaneers could do far more damage to them than he could possibly do to these dreadful brethren of the coast."
81,441-128988-0034.flac," and that unless he wished to bring upon them troubles greater than those of famine or pestilence, they begged that he would retract his oath. when the high dignitary had cooled down a little, he saw that there was a good deal of sense in what the representative of the people had said to him."
82,441-128988-0030.flac," and to be afterwards addressed in terms of such underheard of insolence and abuse, was more than he could bear, and in the presence of many of his officials and attendants, he swore terrible oath that after that hour he would never again give quarter to any buccaneer."
83,441-128988-0035.flac," eddie also discovered much to his surprise that there were very few provisions on board. or when the vessel was sent from havana, it was supposed she would make but a very short cruise."
84,441-128988-0032.flac," and they feared that when it became known that no buccaneer was to receive quarter, the spanish colonists would be treated in the same way, no matter where they might be found and taken."
85,441-128988-0031.flac," but when the inhabitants of havana and the surrounding villages heard of this terrible resolution of their governor, they were very much disturbed. they lived in constant danger of attack, especially those who were engaged in fishing or maritime pursuits."
86,441-128988-0028.flac," and there he composed a letter to the governor of havana, a part of which red as follows. i shall never hence forward give quarter unto any spaniard whatsoever."
87,441-128988-0021.flac," lallonois now stood a proud victor on the jack of his prize, and being a mount of principle, he determined to live up to the distinguished reputation which he had acquired in that part of the world."
88,441-128988-0010.flac," by the time the war vessel had arrived at the little skials, lollonwa had made his preparation to attack the place. he had procured two large canoes, and in these he had intended to row up to the town and land with his men."
89,441-128988-0022.flac," bearing his muscular and hairy right arm, he clutched the herndle of his sharp and heavy cutlass and ordered the prisoners to be brought up from below, one at a time, and conducted to the place where he stood."
90,441-128988-0003.flac," he did not go out in search of ships, but directed his vessel to a little village called de los caios, on the coast of cuba. for here, he thought was a chance for a good and easy stroke of business."
91,441-128988-0008.flac," it was almost impossible for him to believe it. the good news of the death of lollonois had come from campeche to havana and the people of the latter town also rejoiced greatly. to be now told that this scourge of the west indies was alive,"
92,441-128988-0016.flac," the man of war was anchored not very far from the town, and when about two o'clock in the morning, the watch on deck saw some canoes approaching, they supposed them to be boats from shore."
93,441-128988-0012.flac," with canon and a well-armed crew, would have altered his plans so completely that he would have left that part of the coast of cuba with all possible expedition. but the pirates of that day seemed to pay very little attention to the element of odds."
94,441-128988-0004.flac," so that large ships could not approach very near, and thus the villagers were kept busy carrying goods and supplies and small boats, backwards and forwards from the town to the vessels at anchor."
95,441-128988-0009.flac," and was about to fall upon a peaceful little village on the island over which he ruled, filled the governor with rage as well as amazement, and he ordered a well-armed ship with a large crew of fighting men to sail immediately for the los gios."
96,441-128988-0015.flac," and he also needed a larger force than he had with him, and he therefore captured some men who were fishing along the coast and put them into his canoes to help work the ores. then by night he proceeded slowly in the direction of the spanish vessel."
97,441-128988-0007.flac," informing the governor of the island that the cruel pirate la lone wa was in a ship a short distance from their village, which he undoubtedly intended to attack. when the governor heard this astonishing tale,"
98,441-128988-0023.flac," he wished to give spain a lesson which would make her understand that he was not to be interfered with in the execution of his enterprises, and he determined to allow himself the pleasure of personally teaching this lesson."
99,441-128988-0011.flac," but now there was a change in the state of affairs, and he was obliged to alter his plans. the ordinary person in command of two small boats, who should suddenly discover that a village, which he supposed almost defenseless, was protected by a large man of war."
100,441-128988-0006.flac," he cruised about the coast at some distance from their los coyos, endeavoring to procure two small boats in which to approach the town. but although his preparations were made as quietly as possible, the presence of his vessel was discovered by some fishermen."
101,441-128988-0027.flac," who had been preserved from the fate of the others because lawonois had some correspondence to attend to, and he needed a messenger to carry a letter. the pirate captain went into the cabin, where he found writing materials ready to his hand."
102,441-128988-0025.flac," and when the poor fellow had finished by telling that he had come there, not of his own accord, but simply for the purpose of obeying his master, to hang all the pirates except their leader, that great buckeneer laughed, and finding he could get nothing more from the negro."
103,441-128988-0013.flac," if they met an enemy who was weak, they would fall upon him. and if they met with one who was a good deal stronger than themselves, they would fall upon him all the same. when the time came to fight, they fought."
104,441-128988-0014.flac," but no intention of giving up his project entered his mind. as the spanish vessel was in his way, he would attack her and get her out of his way if the thing could be done. in this new state of affairs, he was obliged to use stratagem."
105,441-128988-0001.flac," that he had come back a comparative pauper surprised no one, for this was a common thing to happen to a pirate. but the wonder was that he got back at all. he had no money, but by the exercise of his crafty abilities."
106,441-128988-0019.flac," one canoe attacking her on one side and the other on the other. before the spanish could comprehend what had happened, there were more than 20 pirates upon their decks, the dreaded lollomwa at their head."
107,441-128988-0026.flac," cut off his head likewise, and his body was tumbled into the sea after those of his companions. now there was not a spaniard left on board the great ship except one man."
108,441-128988-0018.flac," but their way was a very different one from any which could have been expected by the captain of the ship. they rode off into the darkness instead of going toward the town, and waited until nearly daybreak, then they boldly made for the man of war."
109,441-128988-0005.flac," here was a nice little prize that could not get away from him, and lawon wa had plenty of time to make his preparations to seize it. as he could not sail a ship directly up to the town,"
110,441-128988-0024.flac," this man who was not a soldier was desperately frightened and begged pitiously for his life. la l'han woi finding that the man was willing to tell everything he knew, questioned him about the sending of this vessel from havana."
111,441-128988-0017.flac," for, as has been said, such vessels were continually plying about those shallow waters. the canoes were hailed, and after having given an account of themselves, they were asked if they knew anything about the pirate ship upon the coast."
112,441-128988-0020.flac," and they fought each scoundrel of them like three men, and the savage fight ended by every spanish sailor or officer who was not killed or wounded, being forced to stay below decks, where the hatches were securely fastened down upon them."
113,441-128988-0000.flac, chapter 13. a resurrected pirate

180,1447-130551-0030.flac, it is little more than a platitude. it is not consistent with elevated and dignified character. it is not wholly insignificant.

187,1447-130551-0031.flac, it is notoriously easy to exaggerate. it is the common consent of men. it is unnecessary to multiply instances.

189,1447-130551-0033.flac, it runs counter to all established customs. it was a matter of notoriety. it wears a ragged and dangerous front.

199,1447-130551-0025.flac, it dissipates every doubt and scrupal. it enslaves the imagination. it extorted from him expressions of irritability.
200,1447-130551-0026.flac, it gives one a little grip at the throat. it has been stigmatized as irrelevant. it has more than passing interest.
201,1447-130551-0029.flac, it is an odd jealousy. it is an intolerable idea. it is impossible to resist acknowledging this.
202,1447-130551-0032.flac, it makes life insupportable. it must be a matter of conjecture. it occasions suspicion and discontent.

205,1447-130551-0024.flac, it assumes the shape of malignity. it betrays a great want of prudence and discernment. it defies description.
206,1447-130551-0013.flac," in the dim procession of ears, and the highest conceivable degree, in the local phrase, in the nature of things,"
207,1447-130551-0010.flac," in extenuation of the past, in high good humor."
208,1447-130551-0006.flac," in a kind of confused astonishment, in a most commendable fashion, in a most impressive vein, in a position of undisputed supremacy."
209,1447-17506-0029.flac," has never before heard of him. how singular exclaimed louise, i wonder why he has tried to deceive us. oh, the world is full of imposters, but when you are onto their game, they are quite harmless."
210,1447-17506-0018.flac," he has given his name as feralti, but added no title. account, did you say? yes, replied uncle john. the proprietor looked curiously toward the young man whose back only was visible."
211,1447-17506-0033.flac," i do not imagine we shall see much of this young man in any event, and know that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colors. you will know how to handle him better than i can advise you."
212,1447-17506-0011.flac," the count clung to louise's side, but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins."
213,1447-17506-0014.flac," to establish friendly relations with his girls. next morning, after breakfast, he wandered through the lobby and paused at the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel was a brother of that floreano who managed the hotel de vizuv."
214,1447-17506-0026.flac," he carefully placed the card in his pocketbook. thank you, said he. it is a fine morning count, charming mr. merrick. uncle john walked away. he was glad that he had not suspected that young men unjustly."
215,1447-17506-0007.flac," new york adopts a good many,"" said uncle john dryly. it has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me. the dancers entered at that moment and the americans were forced to seat themselves hastily, so as not to obstruct the view of others."
216,1447-17506-0003.flac," a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girls seemed to recognize an acquaintance, for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her."
217,1447-17506-0010.flac," afterward, uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of red hot scoria toward the sky."
218,1447-17506-0005.flac," introducing him to uncle john and her cousins as count ferraldi, whom she had once met in new york while he was on a visit to america."
219,1447-17506-0000.flac, chapter 9. count ferralti.
220,1447-17506-0034.flac," said louise slowly as she resumed her writing. well, then, girls, what do you say to a stroll around the village, asked their uncle? i'm told it's a proper place to buy silk stockings and inlaid woodwork. they come assorted, i suppose."
221,1447-17506-0013.flac, but there was something in the appearance of the scalo italian noblemen that stamped his character as artificial and insincere. he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow.
222,1447-17506-0004.flac," he was a nice-looking young fellow, beth thought, and had a foreign and quite distinguished air. presently, louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party."
223,1447-17506-0024.flac," and no such noble families in your america. uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window. the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow. i misunderstood your name last evening, he said, i thought you were count ferralti."
224,1447-17506-0022.flac," observe, sr. here is our record of nobility. it is the same as the blue book or the purge of england. either fortunately or unfortunately i cannot say you have no need of such a book in america."
225,1447-17506-0002.flac," as they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance, louise gave a start of surprise."
226,1447-17506-0006.flac, the count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that patsy thought affected and said in excellent english.
227,1447-17506-0027.flac," when an imposter is unmasked, it is no longer dangerous. he joined his nieces who were all busy engaged in writing letters home and remarked casually. you've been deceived in your italian friend, louise."
228,1447-17506-0009.flac," who seem very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present. the tarantella originated in ischia, but sorrento and capri have the best answers."
229,1447-17506-0021.flac," my dear senior, there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all italy. yet, you say you don't know the feralty family."
230,1447-17506-0031.flac," or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might enjoy. moreover, louise being in love with that young weldem, her mother so strongly objected to,"
231,1447-17506-0025.flac," and that is right, sir, was the prompt reply, allow me to offer you my card. uncle john took the card and read conte leonardo ferralti, milano, italia."
232,1447-17506-0015.flac," that gave him an excuse to talk with the man, who spoke very good english and was exceedingly curious to his guests, especially when they were american."
233,1447-17506-0017.flac, he turned to his list of guests who registered by card and not in a book and continued.
234,1447-17506-0012.flac, and beth replied that his men were so like those of their cousin louise that the two ought to get along nicely together. uncle john liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men generally to meet them.
235,1447-17506-0028.flac," he is neither account nor of noble family. although i suppose when you met him in new york, he had an object and posing as a titled aristocrat. the girl paused examining the point of her pen thoughtfully."
236,1447-17506-0020.flac," that i cannot tell you, sr. merrick. oh, perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country. i, i know little of the nobility, answer floriano indignantly."
237,1447-17506-0030.flac," uncle john hardly knew what to say further. he felt he was in an awkward position for louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces, and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian."
238,1447-17506-0001.flac," at dinner, it was announced that the famous tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at 9 o'clock, and the girls told uncle john that they must not miss this famous site, which is one of the most unique in sorrento or indeed in all italy."
239,1447-17506-0016.flac," count ferralty, the young man standing by the window yonder. i—i did not know he said hesitatingly. the gentleman arrived last evening, and i had not yet learned his name. let me see."
240,1447-17506-0008.flac," count ferralti found the place beside louise, but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment. the dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troop of laughing peasants dressed in native costumes."
241,1447-17506-0019.flac, then he remarked that the eruption of vizuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time.
242,1447-17506-0023.flac," he turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of x. find me if you can, account for aldi in the list. uncle john looked. he put on his glasses and looked again."
243,1447-17506-0032.flac," she would not be likely to care much for this italian fellow, and mrs. merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughter's mind from dwelling on her entanglement. oh well, my dear, he said to her, you must act as you see fit."
244,5561-41615-0043.flac," gabai grace coerced her friends and went on down the street discussing the probable fate of the woodbeat fruits. to return to those youthful transgressors, they were spending a most uncomfortable half hour with miss thompson. she was merciless in her denunciation of their conduct."
245,5561-41615-0034.flac," grace was thoroughly angry with her. she could not forgive eleanor for having accused her and her friends of caring tales before almost the entire school. therefore, a forced apology would not have peace her wounded pride."
246,5561-41615-0006.flac," mabel nodded. what was written on it, mabel? asked grace curiously. mabel looked distressed for a moment. then she said,"
247,5561-41615-0030.flac," i will not tolerate such behavior."" eleanor gleared at the principal, whose face was rigid in its purpose, then sank into the nearest vacant seat, saying defiantly, ""...you may keep me here all night if you like."""
248,5561-41615-0010.flac," we don't want you to tell. if it doesn't concern us, we don't care. do we girls?"" no indeed was the reply. just then the bell sounded and the girls returned to their seats with the riddle still unsolved."
249,5561-41615-0024.flac," i wrote it miss thompson, she said clearly. i wrote it because i wished to."
250,5561-41615-0046.flac," when the last girl had disappeared, the principal turned to eleanor."
251,5561-41615-0015.flac," that it is strictly forbidden for any pupil to absent herself from school for the purpose of attending a circus, matinee, or any public performance of this nature. i have so severely disciplined pupils for this offense that for a long time no one has disobeyed me."
252,5561-41615-0019.flac," and that a paper has been circulated and signed by certain pupils who pledge themselves to play true and attend the matinee tomorrow. the eyes of grace and her charms turn questionally toward mabel allison, who nodded slightly in the affirmative. so that was what all the whispering and mystery had meant."
253,5561-41615-0026.flac," if you had that paper in your possession, bring it to me at once, and never answer me again as you did just now. you are both disrespectful and impertinent. but miss thompson's anger-tort eleanor was nothing compared with the tempest that the principal had aroused in eleanor."
254,5561-41615-0000.flac, chapter 15. a woodbeard lark
255,5561-41615-0017.flac, such a decision is worse than disobedience. it is lawlessness.
256,5561-41615-0036.flac," the girls suddenly donned their raps and fled from the building like fugitives from justice. once on the street, a lively confab and sood, all talking at once. let's take turns talking, craig gray's laughing. we shall understand each other a little better."
257,5561-41615-0013.flac," and then she looked towards grace, whose steady gray eyes were fixed on the principal's face with respectful attention. i don't believe grace is guilty at any rate thought ms. thompson, then she addressed the assembled girls. something has come to my ears, girls, said the principal."
258,5561-41615-0041.flac," no say grace shortly. she deserves to be punished. the thing she said to ms. thompson were disgraceful, and i shall never forgive her for the way she spoke of us. i wouldn't say that grace remarked anne. you can never tell what may happen to change your views."
259,5561-41615-0038.flac," i suppose it did look as though i told you girls said, maybell allison, who would join them at the gate. you know i was with you at recess right after the paper had been passed to me."
260,5561-41615-0035.flac," she drew a breath of relief when the eight girls were safely outside the study hall door. hurry up, she said. we'll talk when we get outside school. don't stop for a minute. if miss thompson notices that we're gone, she'll send after us."
261,5561-41615-0040.flac," they will be weeping and whaling in the skull and crossbones crowd exclaim, nora. they are all in this mix-up, and if they aren't suspended, they'll be lucky."
262,5561-41615-0018.flac," the standard of the school will be lowered. therefore, i intend to sift this matter to the bottom and find out what mischievous influence prompted this act of insubordination. report says that this movement originated in the junior class."
263,5561-41615-0021.flac, what i assist upon knowing now is who are the real culprits beginning with the girl who originated the paper to the last one who signed it.
264,5561-41615-0037.flac," she has certainly shown her true colors this time. i never heard of anything more unjust than the way she accused us when we knew nothing about her role plans at mary and barbara. it was abominable, said eva allen. the other girls expressed their disapproval in equally frank terms."
265,5561-41615-0003.flac," at recess, there was more grouping and whispering, and grace was puzzled and not a little hurt over the way in which she and her friends were ignored. such a thing had not happened since the basketball trouble the previous year."
266,5561-41615-0023.flac," after they had stood for what seemed to them in age, but was really only a couple of minutes. you may be seated. the girl who composed and wrote that agreement will now rise and explain herself. without hesitating, eleanor rose, in regard to the principle with an insolent smile,"
267,5561-41615-0005.flac, here comes mabel's suggestica. maybe she has seen the paper.
268,5561-41615-0048.flac, you may apologize to me now and tomorrow to the girls you have accused of treachery.
269,5561-41615-0025.flac," because it has spoiled all our fun. there was a gasp of horror at eleanor's assertion, no one had ever before spoken so disrespectively to the revered principal. miss seval said the principal quietly, although her flashing eyes and set lips show that she was very angry."
270,5561-41615-0009.flac, i can't bear to have secrets and not tell you.
271,5561-41615-0002.flac," and as the morning advance they became fully aware that something unusual was in the wind. several times they caught sight of a folded paper being stethily passed from one desk to another, but as to its contents they had no idea as it was not handed to any one of them."
272,5561-41615-0039.flac," it was passed to me by mistake. very likely, i agree, grace. i wonder who did tell ms. thompson. i saw several goals with the paper."
273,5561-41615-0014.flac," that i find hard to credit, but before you leave here this afternoon, i must know who is innocent and who is guilty. ms. thompson paused, and a number of girls stirred uneasily in their seats, while a few glanced quickly toward eleanor who was looking straight ahead, the picture of innocence."
274,5561-41615-0001.flac," the majority, however, appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard. one group standing near one of the windows, of which eleanor was the center, laughed so loudly that they were sent to their seats."
275,5561-41615-0020.flac, grace and really congratulated herself on having kept clear of the whole thing. none of her friends were implicated either. even mabel had refused to sign.
276,5561-41615-0033.flac," grace motioned the girls to hurry. she wished to leave the room with her friends before miss thompson noticed them. she knew the principal would insist on an apology from eleanor, and either she nor her friends wished it. for the first time since eleanor had chosen to cut their acquaintance,"
277,5561-41615-0028.flac, words cannot express my contempt for them. and right here i accused grace harlow and her sorority of getting the information from mabel allison yesterday and carrying it to you. they are all tail bearers and sneaks.
278,5561-41615-0032.flac, those girls who were not in any way implicated in this matter are just smishy said. about one-third of the girls arose and prepared to leave the study hall. the pie sigma tau being among the number.
279,5561-41615-0031.flac," nevertheless, she did not again attempt to leave the room. she had met with the will stronger than her own, and she realized it. ignoring eleanor's final remark, miss thompson once more turned her attention to the matter in hand."
280,5561-41615-0044.flac, and the tear of suspension arose in more than one mind as they listened to rescathing remarks.
281,5561-41615-0008.flac," and did you sign it as jessica? i certainly did not respond to maple. it was, she stopped and flushed."
282,5561-41615-0012.flac," dismissed the senior class and requested the three level classes to remain in their seats. after the seniors had quietly left the study hall, miss thompson stood gravely regarding the rows of girls before her. her eyes wandered toward where ellen or sat, looking bored and indifferent."
283,5561-41615-0029.flac," with these words, eleanor angley flung the book she held on the desk and walked down the aisle towards the door, but miss thompson barred her way. stop miss sevelle, she commanded."
284,5561-41615-0022.flac," her example was followed until two-thirds of the girl's present were standing. the principal stood silently regarding them with an expression of severity that was decidedly disconfidding. that will do, she said, currently."
285,5561-41615-0004.flac," eleanor started that paper, whatever it is said nora o'malley of the pysigmatown, who stood in a group around her desk. she was here when i came in this morning, and i was early too."
286,5561-41615-0042.flac," it will have to be something remarkable in this instance for plyde grey's scrimmly, as she bade the girls goodbye. remember girls, basketball practice again tomorrow, and the rest of the week. miss thompson has promised me the gymnasium. please make it a point to be on hand."
287,5561-41615-0011.flac," on wednesday, aside from a little more whispering and significant glances exchanged among the pupils, not a ripple disturbed the calm of the study hall. it was therefore a distinct and not altogether pleasant surprise when miss thompson walked into the room."
288,5561-41615-0016.flac," i was therefore astonished to learn that a number of girls, regardless of the rules, have taken matters into their own hands and have decided to absent themselves from school tomorrow in order to attend the matinee to be given in the theater."
289,5561-41615-0045.flac," but there was nothing funny about it now. when, with the exception of eleanor, the principal dismissed them, they followed decoriously out, very uneasy in mind. ms. thompson had taken their names, but had not stated their punishment, and it was certain that they would be made to feel the full weight of her displeasure."
290,5561-41615-0027.flac," the latter flushed, then turned perfectly white with rage. still standing, she reached down."
291,5561-41615-0007.flac," but i gave my word of honor before i read it that i wouldn't mention the contents to anyone. then of course we won't ask you, said anne pearson quickly. but tell us this much. is it about any of us? no replied, mabel. it isn't. it is something i was asked to sign."
292,5561-41615-0047.flac," do you intend to obey me, miss seville? ask miss thompson? still, there was no answer. very well, continue miss thompson. your silence indicates that you are still in subordinate. you may therefore choose between two things."
293,5561-39621-0015.flac," and 20 other courtiers followed by their people in their baggage, closed this veritably triumphant march. the pomp was of a military character."
294,5561-39621-0039.flac, and conducts him to a rich bride. then all these people rejoice. they love their king.
295,5561-39621-0017.flac," when the king passed before him, the unknown, who had lent ford over the balcony to obtain a better view, and who had concealed his face by leaning on his arm, felt his heart swell and overflow with a bitter jealousy. the noise of the trumpets excited him."
296,5561-39621-0004.flac," nevertheless, i made it a condition of the bargain that if monsieur wished to keep his diamond, it should be held to monsieur was again in funds. oh no, not at all, i told you to sell it."
297,5561-39621-0041.flac," perry are there not examples in which a man of my condition should himself, my lord, in the name of heaven?"
298,5561-39621-0000.flac, chapter 7. parry.
299,5561-39621-0008.flac," the unknown asked for a glass of wine, broke off a morsel of bread, and did not stir from the window whilst he ate and drank."
300,5561-39621-0018.flac," the popular acclimations deafened him. for a moment he allowed his reason to be absorbed in this flood of lights, tumult and brilliant images. he is a king murmured he in an accent of despair. then, before he had recovered from his sombre reverie,"
301,5561-39621-0029.flac," yes, my lord, but i wrote him a letter. well, he read it and received me, my lord. did that letter thoroughly explain my position in my views? oh, yes, said perry with a sad smile. it painted your very thoughts faithfully. well, then, perry."
302,5561-39621-0001.flac, and landing an ear to the various noises.
303,5561-39621-0038.flac," all these trumpets are his, all those gilded housings are his, all those gentlemen wear swords that are his. his mother proceeds him in a carriage magnificently encrossed with silver and gold. happy mother!"
304,5561-39621-0007.flac, dinner has already been refused.
305,5561-39621-0037.flac," ah, perry replied the young man ironically."
306,5561-39621-0010.flac, with cropoly were mingled and jostled on the staircase.
307,5561-39621-0019.flac," all the noise, all the splendor had passed away. at the angle of the street there remained nothing beneath the stranger, but a few horse-discordant voices shouting at intervals. vive la roy!"
308,5561-39621-0013.flac, her gentleman on horseback at both sides. the king then appeared mounted upon a splendid horse of sacks and breed with a flowing mane.
309,5561-39621-0027.flac," i do not despair, perry. have you fathened my resignation?"" the old man raised his trembling hands towards heaven. let me know, said the stranger. disguise nothing from me. what has happened? my recital will be short, my lord."
310,5561-39621-0011.flac," the quattaraj advanced slowly, lighted by a thousand flambo in the streets and from the windows."
311,5561-39621-0022.flac," make way monstros de la hotelier, to the entrance of your house."
312,5561-39621-0005.flac," pay yourself at the unknown. i will do someone's ear since you so positively require it. a sad smile passed over the lips of the gentleman. place the money on that trunk, said he, turning round and pointing to the piece of furniture."
313,5561-39621-0012.flac, drawn like a carriage by four black horses.
314,5561-39621-0020.flac," how good-looking the king is, how strongly he resembles his illustrious father. a handsome likeness at petrino."
315,5561-39621-0016.flac," were traveling dresses, but all the rest were clothed in warlike panapoli."
316,5561-39621-0023.flac, the window was instantly closed. petrina pointed out the way to the newly arrived guest who entered without uttering a word. the stranger waited for him on the landing. he opened his arms to the old man and led him to his seat.
317,5561-39621-0006.flac, after having taken from it the amount of his reckoning.
318,5561-39621-0036.flac," what is the meaning of all the noise which preceded me? what are these people crying? viva la roy? or, what king do they mean?"
319,5561-39621-0003.flac," whispered, munsuya, the diamond has been valued. ah, so the traveler. well? well munsuya, the jeweler of sar, gives 280 pastolles for it. have you them? i thought it best to take the munsuya."
320,5561-39621-0034.flac," parry, is that all? is that all? yes, my lord, that is all. after this brief reply, and soot a long interval of silence, broken only by the convulsive breeding of the heel of the young man on the floor."
321,5561-39621-0043.flac," what am i going to do, perry? what everyone in my family does. my mother lives in public charity. my sister begs for my mother. i have somewhere other brothers who equally beg for themselves. and i, the eldest, will go and do as all the rest do. i will go and ask charity."
322,5561-39621-0024.flac," never! harry, cry the gentleman. i beg you will. you come from england, you come so far. ha, it is not for your age to undergo the fatigue my service requires. rest yourself. i have my reply to give you, lord, shape in the first place."
323,5561-39621-0014.flac," the young prince exhibited, when bowing to some windows from which issued the most animated acclimations, a noble and handsome continence, illuminated by the flambot of his pages. by the side of the king, though a little in the rear,"
324,5561-39621-0002.flac, the stranger did not pay them the least attention.
325,5561-39621-0031.flac," what arrest you, my most faithful servant? yes, my lord. and notwithstanding you had signed the name, perry, to all my letters, my lord,"
326,5561-39621-0032.flac," the young man leaned forward, thoughtful and sad. i, that's what he did before his people, said he, endearing to cheat himself with hopes. but privately, between you and him, what did he do? answer!"
327,5561-39621-0030.flac," then the general sent me back the letter by an aide to camp, informing me that if i were found the next day within the circumscription of his command, he would have me arrested."
328,5561-39621-0021.flac," cropulli was feeding their gossip with his own personal remarks, without observing that an old man on foot, but leading a small irish horse by the bridal, was endeavoring to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the entrance of the medici. but at that moment the voice of the stranger was heard from the window."
329,5561-39621-0045.flac," my good perry said he, order a fire, drink, eat, sleep and be happy. let us both be happy, my faithful friend, my only friend. we are rich as riches kings."
330,5561-39621-0026.flac," can you doubt my energy? i have meditated this journey 10 years, in spite of all councils and all obstacles. have you faith in my perseverance?"
331,5561-39621-0025.flac," my lord said the old man, do not hasten to alarm yourself, all is not lost, i hope. you must employ energy, but more particularly resignation."" perry said the young man, i have reached this place through a thousand snares and after a thousand difficulties."
332,5561-39621-0009.flac," cries arose in the distance, a confused buzzing filled the lower part of the city, and the first distinct sounds that struck the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses."
333,5561-39621-0040.flac," well, well, my lord said, perry, more uneasy at the turn of the conversation had taken than at the other. you never assume the unknown that my mother and my sister, whilst all this is going on in honor of the king of france, have neither money nor bread. you know that i, my self, shall be poor and degraded within a fortnight."
334,5561-39621-0033.flac," these cavaliers conducted me in great haste to the little port of tenby, through me rather than embarked me into a little fishing boat about to self-abritany, and here i am. o, side the young man, clasping his neck convulsively with his hand and with a sob,"
335,5561-39621-0042.flac," no, no, i have two arms, perry, and i have a sword. and he struck his arm violently with his hand and took down his sword, which hung against the wall."
336,5561-39621-0044.flac," and with these words, which he finished sharply with a nervous and terrible laugh, the young man girded it on his sword, took his hat from the trunk,"
337,5561-39621-0035.flac, the old man endeavored to change the conversation. it was leading to thoughts much too sinister.
338,5561-39621-0028.flac," but in the name of heaven do not tremble so. it is in patience, perry. come, what did the gentleman say to you? at first the gentleman would not receive me."
339,5561-41616-0020.flac," and all the baskets soon will land. we shout, we sing, the praises of the seniors. hardly had the last notes died away when the referee blew the whistle and the teams hussled to their positions. grace and julia crosby faced each other, deemed amably and shook hands."
340,5561-41616-0035.flac," just before the last half started, miss thompson and miss cain came in and walked to the other end of the gallery. well, eleanor and her crowd saw them."
341,5561-41616-0010.flac," wasn't it nice of ms. thompson to exonerate us publicly, asdane? she's always just replied grace. i can't understand how eleanor could be so rude and disagreeable to her. she is disliked ms. thompson from the first. i wonder whether she apologized to ms. thompson last night and used grace?"
342,5561-41616-0005.flac, to as many and many a year ago in an age beyond recall that nor the freshmen loathe that.
343,5561-41616-0025.flac," this ended the first half with the score of 5-2 in favor of the juniors. they'll have to work to catch up with his now-signor o'malley, triumphantly to the members of the team, who's at resting in the little side room off the gymnasium. we have the lead, but we can't afford to boast yet, replied grace."
344,5561-41616-0011.flac," i feel sure that she didn't, and i'm just as sure that she won't get back until she does. we shall manage to exist if she doesn't suggest a dryly."
345,5561-41616-0012.flac," she felt a personal grudge against eleanor for her accusation against maple, who had grown very dear to her and whom she moutored like a hen with one chick. she'll probably appear at the game and all her glory said miriam nesbitt."
346,5561-41616-0032.flac," ready circled about the victors, almost too delighted for words. he was filled with profound admiration for them. the boys cracked team couldn't have played a better game, he said solemnly, and the girls knew that he could pay them no higher compliments. for this team was considered invincible by the high school boys."
347,5561-41616-0015.flac," julia crosby and grace took turns sprinting around the gymnasium three times in succession, while miriam nezbit timed them. grace finishing just two seconds ahead of julia. by a quarter of two, the gallery was fairly well filled, and by five minutes of two, it was crowded."
348,5561-41616-0030.flac," and the sensational playing of nora and miriam was a matter of wonder to the spectators, who considered it to be the fastest, most brilliant, half-ever played by an oakdale team."
349,5561-41616-0009.flac," i have been practicing a most encouraging howl. hippie, david, and ready have a new one too. ready says it's marvellously extraordinary and appallingly great."
350,5561-41616-0017.flac," a tall junior who stood up and beat time with both hands. and he composed the song the week before. the juniors had all received copies of the words and had learned them by heart. they now sang with the utmost glee and came out particularly strong on the chorus, which ran,"
351,5561-41616-0002.flac," they must turn in two themes every week of not less than 600 words on certain subjects to be assigned to them. if, during this time, any one of them should be reported for a misdemeanor, they were to be suspended without delay."
352,5561-41616-0021.flac," then stood vigilant, eyes on the ball that the referee balanced in her hands. up it went, the whistle sounded, and the two captains sprang straight for it. grace captured it, however."
353,5561-41616-0016.flac," the juniors, with the exception of eleanor seville's faction, arrived in a body. gave the high school y'all the moment they spied their team."
354,5561-41616-0038.flac," she talked for a moment to edna and eleanor. they tossed their heads, but they didn't hiss anymore. what did rusei to them ask grace curiously?"
355,5561-41616-0007.flac," by the way, ansa grace, as you are a poet, you must compose a basketball song today, and i'll see that the juniors all have copies. it's time we had one. let me see what would be a good tune. rally round the flank suggested miriam nezbit, that has a dandy swing to it."
356,5561-41616-0033.flac," perhaps we'll challenge you someday, reddy, sigreis mischievously. i believe you'd win at that, he said so earnestly that everyone laughed. it was a great triumph, suggestica, proudly, as she stood with mabel and anne in the locker room while the girls resumed street clothing. and my knew how it was a success, too."
357,5561-41616-0022.flac," and sent it flying toward miriam who was so carefully guarded that she dared not attempt to make the basket, and after a fain managed to throw it to nora who tried for the basket at long range and missed. there was a general scramble for the ball and for five minutes neither team scored."
358,5561-41616-0014.flac," and rapidly dawned their gymnasium suits. the spectators had not yet begun to arrive as it was still early, so the girls indulged in a little warming up practice, did a few stunts, and skipped about, overflowing with animal spirits."
359,5561-41616-0037.flac, they were sitting down front on the same side as eleanor's crowd. you know what a temper ruth dean has and how ferocious she can look.
360,5561-41616-0036.flac," hard to tell, said nora. they hissed miss thompson. very softly you may be sure, continue jessica, but it was hissing just the same."
361,5561-41616-0031.flac," whose loyal supporters swooped down upon them the moment the whistle blew and pranced about whooping like savages. that was the greatest game i ever saw played under the roof, quite david, ringing grace's hand, while hippie hopped about uttering little yelps of joy."
362,5561-41616-0006.flac," what a delicate way of reminding me that i once was a freshman she exclaimed. anne has a new accomplishments at grace, she can spout poetry without trying. small credit is do me said anne smiling, anyone can twist annabelle lee to suit the occasion."
363,5561-41616-0013.flac," the recess bell cut short the conversation, and the girls returned to their deaths with far better ideas of the coming game than of the afternoons lessons. saturday, december 12, dawned cold and clear as the girls and both teams were in high spirits as they hustled into their respective locker rooms."
364,5561-41616-0034.flac," glad to know that, sigg race. there were so many different kinds of noises i couldn't distinguish it. there was one noise that started that was promptly hushed, said anne. you heard it too, didn't you, jessica? oh yes, girls. i intended telling you before this, reply, jessica."
365,5561-41616-0004.flac," thank goodness, none of us were concerned in that affair she told the members of her basketball team at recess. there are two girls in the sophomore and three in the freshman team whose basketball order will have to cool until after the mid-year exams."
366,5561-41616-0018.flac," the juniors forever, hurrah and sera, our team is a winner."
367,5561-41616-0024.flac," they played such a close-guarded game that, try as they might, the juniors made no headway, then julia crosby scored on a field goal, making the score 3-2. this spurred the junior team on to greater effort and mary made a brilliant throw to basket that brought forth an ovation from the gallery."
368,5561-41616-0019.flac," shouting the warcry of the juniors. there was a great clapping of hands from the admirers of the juniors at this effort, but the seniors promptly responded from the other end of the gallery to the tune of dixie with. the seniors are the real thing, hurrah, hurrah. our gallant team now takes it stand,"
369,5561-41616-0028.flac," then we'll see that she goes away in a gloomy frame of mindset, nora, for we're going to win, and don't you forget to remember it."
370,5561-41616-0003.flac," their penalty was far from light, but they had not been suspended, and so they resolved to endure it as best they might. grace harlow felt a load lifted from her mind when miss thompson publicly announced that she had not received any information from either maple allison or the pi sigma tower."
371,5561-41616-0001.flac," after conducting opening exercises, ms. thompson pronounced sentence on the culprits. they were to forfeit their recess, library, and all other privileges until the end of the term."
372,5561-41616-0023.flac," then mary and barbara dropped a neat field gold and soon after grace scored on a foul. the junior fans howell joyfully at the good work of their team, the seniors did not intend to allow them to score again in a hurry."
373,5561-41616-0000.flac," 16. the juniors forever when the four classes assembled thursday morning, every girl with the exception of eleanor was in her seat."
374,5561-41616-0029.flac," then the senior scored twice on fowls tying the score. the juniors set their teeth and waited in with all their might in maine, setting a whirlwind pace that caused their fans to shed with wild enthusiasm and fairly days their opponents. grace alone knitted four fowl goals,"
375,5561-41616-0026.flac," we shall win,"" said miriam nezbit confidently. i feel it in my bones. let's hope that your bones are true prophets left mary and barbara. oh, girls exclaimed eva allen from the open door, in which she had been standing looking up at the gallery. allen are is here."
376,5561-41616-0027.flac," where asked nora going to the door? oh yes, i see her. she looks as hot as ever. it's a wonder she'd kinda send to come and watch her mortal enemies play."
377,5561-41616-0008.flac," grace hummed a few bars. the very thing she exclaimed, now anne, get busy at once. you better sing the tune to yourself all the time you're writing it."
378,669-129061-0070.flac," she may be innocent after all, he said. she says so."
379,669-129061-0075.flac," in the most polite manner to a point of friend with whom he, captain m. m. might communicate, and desired that the meeting might take place with as little delay as possible."
380,669-129061-0074.flac, to make any arrangements for the meeting which he had no doubt it was his lord ship's intention to demand and which the circumstances of the morning had rendered inevitable.
381,669-129061-0066.flac," it was damned unfriendly, mack,"" said rodden quite overcome, and covering his face with his hands. he gave way to an emotion, the sight of which caused the tough, old campaigner."

431,669-129061-0011.flac," punctually, as the shrill tone bell of the black marble study clock began to chime nine, sir pitt made his appearance, fresh, neat, smugly shaved,"
432,669-129061-0013.flac, a model of neatness and every propriety. he started when he saw poor rodden in his study in tumbled clothes with bloodshot eyes and his hair over his face.

515,4195-17507-0037.flac," by every saint in the calendar that the girl had saved him from a frightful death, and he would devote his future life to her service. it is wonderful, murmur, foralty."
516,4195-17507-0039.flac," we'd better get back to serrento, said uncle john abruptly."
517,4195-17507-0041.flac, as if they had never known a moment's fear in their lives. so the girl and their uncle climbed into the vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with his usual vigor.
518,4195-17507-0000.flac," and shiny top boots. his long legs enabled him to outstrip the others, and in an almost breathless voice he begged uncle john to choose his carriage, the best de karatsa in a town. we don't want to ride was the answer. the cabman implored."
519,4195-17507-0017.flac," they had sunshine, rain, hail, snow, and a tornado, and then rain again and more sunshine. sunny italy seemed to miss no more that day, as indeed it does many days in winter and spring."
520,4195-17507-0046.flac," who had once lived in america for their luncheon. now or later, and just as it was sitting down to the meal, count for all tea, rejoin them."
521,4195-17507-0036.flac, he was sitting upon his horse and staring with amazement at beth.
522,4195-17507-0019.flac," for he will permit no reproach to lie on his beloved land. but the travel frequently becomes discouraged in the american contingent, especially."
523,4195-17507-0013.flac," it was standing just as it had before, and beside it was another man dressed in a splendid uniform, and his driver had claimed that he had left at home."
524,4195-17507-0005.flac," let us see it. instantly the crowd scampered back to the square, followed more leisurely by uncle john and the girls. there, the uniform vetturio stood beside the one modern carriage in the group. it was new. it was glossy."
525,4195-17507-0028.flac," when the great adventure of the day overtook them. without warning, the wind came whistling around them in a great gale, which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses reeling against the low parapet."
526,4195-17507-0007.flac," be ready to start at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. the man promised, where at his confrarrers, lost all interest in the matter, and the strangers were allowed to proceed without further interruption. they found out all about the amalphie drive that evening, and were glad indeed they had decided to go."
527,4195-17507-0003.flac," ah, but the amalfi road senior, surely you will see that."
528,4195-17507-0048.flac," beth mounted the box and rode beside her friend, the driver."
529,4195-17507-0040.flac, that is if you permit me to accompany you.
530,4195-17507-0001.flac," certainly, they must make the m.a.l.e.e. drive."
531,4195-17507-0016.flac," indeed, the sun did come out, but only to give a discouraged look at the landscape and retire again."
532,4195-17507-0029.flac," and pushed upon the carriages of determined to dash it over the precipice. as it collided against the stonewall, the vehicle tipped dangerously hurling the driver from his seat to dive ahead foremost into the space beneath."
533,4195-17507-0012.flac, hop in my dears. they entered the crazy looking vehicle and found the seats ample and comfortable despite the appearance of dilapidation everywhere prevalent. the driver mounted the box cracked his whip and the lean nags ambled away at a fair pace.
534,4195-17507-0015.flac," this rig is all right uncle. it may not be as pretty as the other, but i expect that one is only kept to make engagements with when it comes to actual use. we don't get it. that's true enough heat return."
535,4195-17507-0031.flac," while the carriage lay wedged against the wall, and the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway between the sea and the sky."
536,4195-17507-0025.flac," and on the other side of the road, the cliffs continue to ascend, a like distance towards the sky."
537,4195-17507-0042.flac," the wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen and as they passed through positano, which is 400 feet high."
538,4195-17507-0034.flac, the adventure was accomplished and the peril was passed and all was well again. uncle john leaped from the carriage followed by louise and patsy.
539,4195-17507-0014.flac," we've been swindled my dears, he said, swindled most beautifully, but i suppose we may as we'll make the best of it. better, a great patsy."
540,4195-17507-0009.flac," i must not ruin a nice dress when i work, answered the man smiling on a bash. but the carriage, what has become of the fine carriage and the good horse's sister, ah, it is dreadful, it is horrible, senior."
541,4195-17507-0044.flac, now a hotel much favored by the tourist. count feralty promised to join them later and wrote on into town to find the surgeon to look after his injured hand. while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a zigzag fashion up to the old monastery.
542,4195-17507-0024.flac," rising straight from the sea, which the highway overhangs at an average height of 500 feet. the travel are being protected only by a low-stone parapet from the vast gulf that yon's beneath."
543,4195-17507-0021.flac," italy is beautiful. it is charming and delightful, but seldom is this true in winter or early spring. the horses went along at a spanking pace that was astonishing. they passed through the picturesque lanes of carento, climbed"
544,4195-17507-0008.flac," they had an early breakfast and were ready at 9 o'clock, but when they came to the gate of the garden, they found only a dilapidated carriage standing before it. do you know where my rig is?"
545,4195-186238-0016.flac," danny reeves' restaurant a block away. patsy was standing in the doorway anxiously watching for him. oh uncle john, she cried as he strolled. i've been really worried about you. it's such a big city and you're a stranger."
546,4195-186238-0001.flac," to pass the time he turned into a small restaurant and had coffee in a plate of cakes, in spite of the fact that patsy had so recently prepared coffee over the sheet iron stove, and bought some hot buns from a nearby bakery. he was not especially hungry, but in sipping the coffee and nibbling the cakes,"
547,4195-186238-0007.flac," the official hesitated and glanced at the little man's cd-garb and country-fied air, but something in the angry glance of the shrewd eye made him fear he had made a mistake. he opened the small door and disappeared."
548,4195-186238-0006.flac," his busy mornings has to look over the mail. he can't see you yet. well, he will see me and right away. tell him john merrick is here. your card, sir. i haven't any. my name will do."
549,4195-186238-0003.flac," another hour was spent in looking in at the shop windows. then suddenly noting the time uncle john started down the street at a swinging pace and presently paused before a building, upon which was a sign reading,"
550,4195-186238-0021.flac," more than enough, sir, i'm getting old and can't earn as much as a younger man, but i'm pretty tough and mean to hold on to that 12 a week as long as possible. what paid do you get, patsy, as uncle john? almost as much as daddy."
551,4195-186238-0013.flac," but didn't go way quietly, you may be sure. mr. marvin and mr. isham both escorted their famous client to the door."
552,4195-186238-0010.flac," uncle john had been advised by patsy where to go for a good cheap luncheon, but he did not heed her admonition. instead, he wrote in a carriage beside the banker to a splendid club, where he was served with the finest dishes this chef could provide on short notice."
553,4195-186238-0009.flac," a great surprise and pleasure, sir. thomas, i'm engaged. the slas was directed at the head of the amazed porter, who, as the door slammed in his face, nodded solemnly and remarked."
554,4195-186238-0025.flac," exceedingly. you must be nearly bankrupt by this time, said patzion tuesday evening. it's an expensive city to live inside uncle john."
555,4195-186238-0000.flac, chapter 25. uncle john acts quickly.
556,4195-186238-0002.flac," he passed the best part of an hour. he smiled when he paid out 25 cents of his slender store for the refreshment. with 5 cents for the car fare, he had now but 12 cents left of the 42 patsy had given him."
557,4195-186238-0027.flac," and we sleep till 8 o'clock, don't we, patsy? ask the major. of course. and the eggs for breakfast. i bought them already, three for a nickel. you don't care for more than one, do you, uncle john? know my dear."
558,4195-186238-0011.flac," moreover, mr. marvin introduced him to several substantial gentlemen, as mr. john merrick of portland, and each one bowed profoundly and declared he was highly honored. yet, uncle john seemed in no way elated by this reception."
559,4195-186238-0022.flac," we're dreadfully rich, uncle john, so you needn't worry if you don't strike a job yourself all at once. any luck today, sir? ask the major tucking an applicant under his chin and beginning on the soup. uncle john shook his head. of course not, sir. patsy quickly. it's too early as yet."
560,4195-186238-0019.flac, they missed me at the office and were glad to have me back.
561,4195-186238-0026.flac," your expenses are nothing at all declared the major with a wave of his hand, but my dinners, a danny reeves, place must cost a lot, protested uncle john."
562,4195-186238-0008.flac, in a moment the door burst open to allow egress to a big red-bearded man in his shirt-sleeves who glanced around briefly and then rushed at uncle john and shook both his hands cordially.
563,4195-186238-0023.flac," don't hurry, uncle john, except that it'll keep you busy there's no need for you to work at all. you're older than i am, suggested the major, and that makes it harder to break in, but there's no hurry, as patsy says. uncle john did not seem to be worrying over his idleness."
564,4195-186238-0020.flac," i've got to raise."" really? said uncle john, seeing it was expected of him. for a fact, its patseys doing of no doubt she weedled the firm into giving me a vacation and now there to pay me 12 a week instead of 10. is that enough? asked uncle john doubtfully?"
565,4195-186238-0012.flac," he talked with easy familiarity of preferred stocks and amalgaded interests and invested, and securities and many other queer things that the bankers seem to understand fully and to listen to with respectful deference."
566,4195-186238-0014.flac, in a moment the great broadway crowd had swallowed up john merrick and five minutes later he was thoughtfully gazing into a shop window again. by and by he but thought himself of the time and took a cab up down.
567,4195-186238-0017.flac," i'm sorry,"" he said humbly, but it's a long way here from downtown. didn't you take a car? no, my dear. why you foolish old uncle come in at once."
568,4195-186238-0015.flac," beside the checkbook, which was carefully hidden away in an inside pocket. so the cost of the cab did not worry him."
569,4195-186238-0024.flac, and issued a string of orders and a voice not nearly so meek and mild as it was when he was in patsy's presence.
570,4195-186238-0005.flac," another hour passed. presently, uncle john jumped up and approached the official. hasn't mr. marvin arrived yet? he inquired sharply. an hour ago was the reply, then why didn't you let me know i want to see him?"
571,4195-186238-0018.flac," the major has been terribly excited over you and swore you should not be allowed to wander through the streets without someone to look after you. but what could we do? i'm alright, declared uncle john cordially shaking hands with patsy's father. have you had a good day?"" thine said the major."
572,4195-186238-0004.flac," uncle john walked in, although the uniformed official at the door eyed him suspiciously. mr. marvin in, he inquired pleasantly, not arrived yet, said the official who wore a big star upon his breast. i'll wait and announce uncle john and sat down upon a leather-covered bench."
573,4195-186236-0018.flac," nor think even clearly as yet. patsy tried to comfort beth, the reminde deersch said she, were no worse off than before. we came, are we? and we had a nice vacation."
574,4195-186236-0027.flac, lawyer who had consented to state the mansion for a time.
575,4195-186236-0020.flac, i'm wondering that myself said the little man meekly.
576,4195-186236-0017.flac," it's all i'll ever get, it seems, and then the thought of the professor and his debts overcame her and she burst into tears. the boy sat doubled within his chair so overcome by the extraordinary fortune that had overtaken him that he could not speak."
577,4195-186236-0014.flac," good-bye to my five thousand,"" said uncle john with his chuckling lap, but i'm much obliged to jane nevertheless. don't we get anything at all? ask beth with quivering lip. no my dear answer the lawyer gently. you're on to own nothing to give you."
578,4195-186236-0026.flac, and he said he hoped to see all the girls again.
579,4195-186236-0002.flac," but there were few tears shed for jane merrick, and the new regime could not fail to be an improvement over the last."
580,4195-186236-0009.flac," lawyer watson and uncle john were there, looking as grave as the important occasion demanded."
581,4195-186236-0007.flac," to offend her. all together they were all better provided for than they had feared would be the case, so the little party spent a pleasant evening and separated early. betten louise to go to their rooms and canvas quietly the events of the day,"
582,4195-186236-0000.flac," chapter 23, patsey adopps and uncle. uncle john and mr. watson did not appear at dinner, being closeted in the former's room."
583,4195-186236-0028.flac, that may be answered the boy.
584,4195-186236-0021.flac," no reply, uncle john. the marriots are out of elmhurst now, and it returns to its rightful owners. you owe me nothing, my lad."
585,4195-186236-0008.flac, and then she went to bed and slept peacefully.
586,4195-186236-0001.flac," being served by the old servences in mere matter of routine. indeed, the arrangements of the household had been considerably changed by the death of its mistress, and without any real head to direct them, the servants were patiently waiting the advent of a new master or mistress."
587,4195-186236-0004.flac," went alone with the three cousins protested that it would not be right for patsy to give him all the estate. but as she was so generous, he would accept enough of his uncle tom's money to educate him as an artist and provide for himself at humble home."
588,4195-186236-0012.flac, of the estate during her lifetime.
589,4195-186236-0016.flac," louise smiled. it was all a great far, she said. i shall take the afternoon train to the city. what an old fraud our dear aunt jane was, and have foolish of me to return her $100 check. i used mine said beth bitterly."
590,4195-186236-0022.flac," louise smiled rather scornfully and betscaled. my mother and i lived so simply in our little flat, said one, that we really haven't any extra room to keep a cat. but we shall be glad to assist uncle john as far as we are able."
591,4195-186236-0010.flac, and the subsequent finding of the will.
592,4195-186236-0006.flac," the balance of power seemed to be in patricia's hands, however."
593,4195-186236-0013.flac," mr. bradley, having provided for that most fully. for this reason, the will i read to you yesterday is of no effect and kenneth forbes inherits from his uncle through his mother all of the estate. blank looks followed mr. watson's statement."
594,4195-186236-0005.flac," louise and beth, having at last full knowledge of their cousin's desire to increase their bequest, were openly very grateful for her good will, although secretly they could not fail to resent patsy's choice of the boy as the proper heir of his uncle's fortune."
595,4195-186236-0025.flac," thank you, my dear, said he, but where's the money to come from? money? bosh, she said. doesn't the major earn a heap with his bookkeeping and haven't i had it raised lately? why, we'll be a snug and contented as pigs and clover. can you cut ready to come with me today, uncle john?"
596,4195-186236-0011.flac, was made subsequent to the one under which jane merrick inherited and therefore supersedes it.
597,4195-186236-0024.flac," no, no, say nothing at all, sir. come, you shall. if i have to drag you, and if you act naughty, i'll send for the major to punish you."
598,4195-186236-0015.flac," patsy laughed, she felt wonderfully relieved. wasn't i the grand lady though with all the fortune i never had, she cried merrily, but it was really fine to be rich for a day and toss the money around as if i didn't have to dress ten heads of hair in ten hours to earn my bread and butter."
599,4195-186236-0003.flac," but being unaware of its import gave it but passing attention. the main subject of conversation was on jane's surprising act in annulling her last will, and forcing patricia to accept the inheritance when she did not want it."
600,4195-186236-0023.flac," father can hardly support his own family, said the other, but i will talk to my mother about uncle john when i get home and see what she says. oh, you don't need to, indeed, cried patsy in great indignation. uncle john is my dear mother's brother, and he's to come and live with the major in me as long as he cares to."
601,4195-186236-0019.flac," i'm going home today,"" said beth, angrily drying her eyes. we'll all go home,"" said patsy cheerfully. for my part remarked uncle john in a great voice, i have no home."
602,4195-186237-0009.flac," not at all, daddy, then don't mind it, child. like is not the money would be the ruination of us all. as, sir, appealing to uncle john."
603,4195-186237-0005.flac," in the old fellow rattled away with the eagerness of a boy telling every detail in the most whimsical manner and finding something humerus in every incident. oh, but it was grand, patsy. he exclaimed, and the colonel wept on my neck when we parted and stained the collar of my best coat."
604,4195-186237-0033.flac," you ought to be very contented, sir."
605,4195-186237-0003.flac," on which account said the mage you're grasping the little man's hand most cordially, all love uncle john like my own brother, and surely he added his voice falling tenderly. my dear violet's brother must be my own."""
606,4195-186237-0032.flac," thank you, patsey,"" said uncle john meekley, and gathered up his 42 cents. you've now a home and a manager, sir, with the money in the bank of patsey and company limited."
607,4195-186237-0015.flac," the place was so plain after the comparative luxury of elmhurst and especially of the rose chamber, patsy had occupied, that the old man could not fail to marvel at the girl's ecstatic joy to find herself in the old tenement again."
608,4195-186237-0029.flac," uncle john hesitated a moment and then drew from an inner pocket of his coat a thin wallet. from this, when she had received it from his hand, the girl..."
609,4195-186237-0000.flac," chapter 24, home again. the major was at a station to meet them."
610,4195-186237-0002.flac," leaving the little man in her wake to rescue her belongings and follow after. he could hardly see patsy at all, the major wrapped her in such an ample embrace, but by and by she escaped to get her breath and then her eyes fell upon the meek form holding her bundles."
611,4195-186237-0001.flac," the girl caught sight of him outside the gates, his face red and beaming as a poppy and bloom and his snowy mustache bristling with eagerness. at once she dropped her bundles and flew to the major's arms."
612,4195-186237-0007.flac," i fought with aunt jane like a pirate and a quite one her heart. when she died she left it me all she had in the world. look at that now,"" said the major wonderingly, which turned out to be nothing at all continued patsy."
613,4195-186237-0026.flac," and if he has the money, he wants to treat every man he meets. uncle john shook his head reproachfully at the major, a very bad habit, sir, he said."
614,4195-186237-0006.flac," his face grew grave. but how about the money patsy deer he asked? did you get nothing out of jane marrix's estate? not a nickel, dad. it was the best joke you ever knew."
615,4195-186237-0027.flac," but patsy is fast-curing me, and after all, it's a wicked city to be carrying a fat pocketbook around in, as i've often observed. my pocketbook is not exactly fat, remarked uncle john, but you've money, sir, for i marked you squandering it on the train, said patsy severely."
616,4195-186237-0023.flac," but just to keep him out of mischief and busy, he can't hang around all day and be happy, i suppose. i'll look around and answer the major briskly as if such a job was the easiest thing in the world to procure, and meantime,"
617,4195-186237-0017.flac, opening from this were two closet-like rooms containing each a bed in a chair with a wash basin on a bracket shelf. on the wails were a few colored prints from the sunday newspaper and one large and fine photograph of a grizzled old soldier.
618,4195-186237-0013.flac," danny reeves himself came instead and made a nice little speech, saying that patsy had always brought good luck to the place and this dinner was his treat to welcome her home. so the major thanked him with gracious dignity and patsy kissed danny on his right cheek."
619,4195-186237-0004.flac," welcome, sir. now and always to our little home. it's modest, sir, but wherever patsy is, the sun is sure to shine. i can believe that, sir, uncle john, with a nod and a smile."
620,4195-186237-0018.flac," that uncle john at once decided must represent the colonel. having noted these details, patzies uncle smoothed back his stubby gray hair with the reflective and half-puzzle gesture. it's cozy enough, my child, and i thank you for my welcome,"" said he."
621,4195-186237-0030.flac," good gracious, she cried delightfully, all this wealth, and you pleading poverty. i never said i was a papa, returned uncle john complacently. you couldn't and be truthful, sir, declared the girl. why, this will last for ages."
622,4195-186237-0025.flac," buy the buy, add the major. if you have any money about you, which is just possible, sir. of course, you'd better turn it over to patsy to keep and let her make you an allowance. that's the way i do. it's very satisfactory. the major is extravagant as claim patsy."
623,4195-186237-0021.flac," the major coughed and turned the lamp a little higher. you'll find the air fine and the neighborhood respectable, he said. to turn the subject, our modest departments are cool in summer and warm in winter and remarkably reasonable in price."
624,4195-186237-0019.flac," but may i inquire where on earth you expect to stomi in this rather limited establishment? where? have you know why, then, she asks an astonishment. it's the finest sofa in the world, uncle john, and you'll sleep there like a top."
625,4195-186237-0011.flac," there's danny reeves' restaurant. let's get off and have our dinner now. i'm as hungry as bear. so they stopped the car and descended, lugging all the parcels into the little restaurant, where they were piled into a chair while the proprietor and the waiters all gathered around patsy to welcome her home."
626,4195-186237-0020.flac," where, indeed, i see, said uncle john, and you can wash in my chamber, added the major with a grand dare, and hang your clothes on the spare hooks behind my door. i haven't many said, uncle john, looking thoughtfully at his red bundle."
627,4195-186237-0016.flac," there was one good-sized living room with an ancient red carpet partially covering the floor. a sheet iron stove, a sofa, a table, and three or four old-fashioned chairs that had probably come from a second-hand dealer."
628,4195-186237-0031.flac," he smokes, observed the major significantly. ba, a pipe, said patsy, and bulldurm is only five cents a bag and a bag ought to last a week, and every saturday nights, sir,"
629,4195-186237-0014.flac," it's no palace, said patsy, entering to throw down the bundles as soon as the major unlock the door. but there's a cricket in the hearth, and it's your home, uncle john, as well as ours. uncle john looked around curiously."
630,4195-186237-0012.flac," my how her eyes sparkle, she fairly danced for joy and ordered the dinner with reckless disregard of the bill. ah, but it's good to be back, said the little bohemian gleefully. the big house at elmhurst was grand and stately major, but there wasn't an ounce of love in the cupboard."
631,4195-186237-0024.flac," meantime, said uncle john, smiling at them, i'll look around myself. to be sure, agreed the major, between the two of us in patsy we ought to have no trouble at all. there was a moment of thoughtful silence after this, and then patsy said,"
632,4195-186237-0028.flac," uncle john laughed and drew his chair up to the table, then he emptied his trouser pockets upon the cloth, and patsy gravely separated the keys in the jackknife from the coins and proceeded to count the money. $7.42, she announced, any more?"
633,4195-186237-0008.flac," for another will was found made by mr. thomas bradley, which gave the money to his own nephew after on jane died. did you ever? wonderful said the major with a sigh. so i was rich for half a day and then poor as ever. it didn't hurt you, did it?"
634,4195-186237-0010.flac," in your case it won't matter, our house is yours and there's plenty and to spare. thank you, sen uncle john, his face grave but his eyes marry. o major, crypatsy suddenly."
635,4195-186237-0022.flac," may i smoke? of course, but don't spoil the lace curtain's deer, answered patsy mischievously."
636,7511-102420-0007.flac," in the loles of the storm i could hear the men's voices high and excited. they too were up. it seemed to me that the storm lasted for hours, but at last it moved off up the valley. the flashes grew to be a mere glimmer."
637,7511-102420-0026.flac," they had heard our shot and came across to see what luck. what ever is the matter with you?"" asked mrs. o'shaunasey. mr. haines told her. they had heard the noise but had thought it thunder. mr. haines told me that if i would cheer up"
638,7511-102420-0027.flac," he would give me his elk teeth. though i don't admire them, they are considered valuable. however, his elk was a cow, and they don't have as nice teeth as do bulls. we had lunch, and the men covered the elk with pine boughs,"
639,7511-102420-0004.flac," always appealed to me, but there was neither wind nor rain, just flash and roar. before the echo died away among the hills, another booming report would seem to shiver the atmosphere and set all our tin ware jangling."
640,7511-102420-0017.flac," are absolutely heartless on a hunt. i was scarcely through panting before we began to descend. we received instructions as to how we should move, so as to keep out of range of each other's guns. then mr. haynes and myself started one way,"
641,7511-102420-0028.flac," to keep the camp robbers from pecking it full of holes. next day the men would come with the horses and pack it into camp. we all felt refreshed, so we started on the trail of those that got away."
642,7511-102420-0046.flac," as if fascinated until i sent her from the table and went out to speak to her about gazing. ""'why, mama,' she said, ""'i had to look. he has swallowed something that won't go either up or down, and i'm afraid he'll choke.'"
643,7511-102420-0009.flac," the men had to find them, and as it took most of the day, we had to put off our hunt. we were open about next morning in the first faint grey light. while the men fed grain to the horses and saddled them, we prepared a hasty breakfast."
644,7511-102420-0035.flac," his eyes were startled and his shining black mains seemed to bristle. i heard the report of guns and he tumbled in a confused heap. he tried to rise, but others coming leaped over him and knocked him down. some more shots."
645,7511-102420-0036.flac," and those behind turned and went back the way they had come. mr. haynes shouted to me, shoot, shoot, why don't you shoot? so i fired my crag, but next i found myself picking myself up."
646,7511-102420-0037.flac," and wondering who had struck me in for what? i was so dizzy i could scarcely move, but i got down to where the others were excitedly admiring the two dead elk that they said were the victims of mrs. o'shaughnessy's gun."
647,7511-102420-0038.flac," she was as excited and delighted as if she had never declared that she would not kill anything. sure, it's many a meal they'll make for a little hungry mouth, she said. she was rubbing her shoulder rooffully."
648,7511-102420-0021.flac," rose the red cliffs with their jagged crags. at the report of the gun, two huge blocks of stone, almost as large as a house, detached themselves and fell. at the same instant, one of the quaking ass groves."
649,7511-102420-0039.flac," i thought old gullier had hit me a biff with a black foreign chalet-y,"" she remarked. mr. haines turned to me and said, you're a dandy hunter. you didn't shoot at all until after the elk were gone."
650,7511-102420-0025.flac," but the elk have to be quartered so as to load them onto a horse. mrs. o'shaunasey and mr. strubel came out of the woods just then. they had seen a big bunch of elk headed by a splendid bull, but got no shot, and the elk went out of the pass."
651,7511-102420-0030.flac," and windfall so thick that we could hardly get through. we were obliged to pick our way carefully to avoid noise, and we were all together, not having come to a place where it seemed better to separate."
652,7511-102420-0050.flac," but we have to listen to run, nigger, run, and the old grey haws come a tearing out the wilderness. i'll sing them to you when i come to denver."
653,7511-102420-0033.flac," we were all on one side, and mr. haines said to me, rest your gun on that rock and aim at the first rib back of the shoulder. if you shoot half-hazard, you may cripple an elk and let it get away to die in misery. so make sure when you fire."
654,7511-102420-0015.flac," we could hear the roar of the gross fincher as it tumbled grumblingly over its rocky bed. to our right rose mile after mile of red cliffs. as the last of the quaking-ass leaves have fallen, there were no golden groves."
655,7511-102420-0044.flac," didn't know he lived up here. he had seen the game warden from whom she had procured her license and so hunted up our camp. he is an odd looking individual, with sad eyes and a drooping mouth, which gives his face a most hopeless, reproachful expression."
656,7511-102420-0024.flac, not an earthquake. you're as white as a ghost. come on up here and see my fine elk. i sat on a log watching him dress his elk. we have found it best not to remove the skin.
657,7511-102420-0048.flac," mary ellen, i have a real treat and surprise for you. just wait a few minutes and i'll bet you'll be happy."" we took our accustomed places around the fire while mr. murray hobbled his kayoos and took an odd looking bundle from the saddle."
658,7511-102420-0016.flac," in their places stood silvery patches against the red background of the cliffs. high overhead, a triangle of wild geese herald the blue sky. i was plumbed out of breath, but men who are most gallant elsewhere."
659,7511-102420-0013.flac," the sun was well up when we reached the little park where we pick it at our horses. then came a long hard climb. it is hard climbing at the best, and when there is a big gun to carry, it is very hard."
660,7511-102420-0005.flac," we are kept so near the great pines that i will confess i was powerfully afraid. had the lightning struck one of the big pines, there would not have been one of us left. i could hear mrs. o'shaughnessy murmuring her prayers when there was a low."
661,7511-102420-0041.flac," supper was ready, but i went to bed at once. they all thought it was because i was so disappointed, but it was because i was so stiff and sore i could hardly move, and so tired i couldn't sleep. next morning, my jaw and neck were so swollen,"
662,7511-102420-0010.flac," we were off before it was more than light enough for us to see the trail. don in the mountains, how i wish i could describe it to you. if i could only make you feel the keen, bracing air, the exhilarating climb."
663,7511-102420-0031.flac," we had about resolved to go to our horses when we heard a volley of shots. that is somebody bunch shooting, said mr. strubel. they are in brewster lake park by the sound. that means that the elk will pass here in a short time and we may get a shot."
664,7511-102420-0006.flac," we had gone to bed, but i couldn't remain there, so i sat on the wagon seat with jureen beside me. something struck the guy ropes of the tent, and i was so frightened i was too weak to cry out. i thought the big tree must have fallen."
665,7511-102420-0034.flac," it didn't seem a minute before we heard the beat of their hoofs, and a queer panting noise that i can't describe. first came a beautiful thing with his head held high."
666,7511-102420-0001.flac," i haven't one thing. i told her i owed you more love than i could ever pay in a lifetime, and she said writing such long letters is a mighty poor way to show it. i have been neglecting you shamefully, i think."
667,7511-102420-0000.flac," camp cloud crest, october 6, 1914. dear mrs. coney, it seems so odd to be writing you and getting no answers."
668,7511-102420-0003.flac," flash after flash of the most blinding lightning, followed by deafening peels of thunder. and as it echoed from mountain to mountain, the uproar was terrifying. i have always loved a storm, the bead of hail and rain, and the roar of wind,"
669,7511-102420-0014.flac," then, too, we had to keep up with the men, and we didn't find that easy to do. at last we reached the top, and sat down on some boulders to rest a few minutes before we started down to the hunting ground, which lay in a cup-like valley far below us."
670,7511-102420-0043.flac," and go back empty handed, and partly to get arrest from mr. murray's everlasting accordion. mr. murray is an old-time acquaintance of mrs. o'shaunaseys. he has a ranch down on the river somewhere. mrs. o'shaunaseys has not seen him for years."
671,7511-102420-0008.flac, and the thunder mirror rumbling. the pines began to mown and soon a little breeze whistled by. so we lay down again. next morning the horses could not be found. the storm had frightened them and they had tried to go home.
672,7511-102420-0020.flac," but i stood still, fascinated by what i saw. our side of the valley was bounded by a rim of rock. over the rim was a sheer wall of rock for 200 feet, to where the gross venture was angrily roaring below. on the other side of the stream,"
673,7511-102420-0012.flac," even at this season. but here there are no songbirds, and only the snapping of twigs, as our horses climbed the frosty trail, broke the silence. we had been cautioned not to talk, but neither mrs. o'shaughnessy nor i wanted to."
674,7511-102420-0049.flac, he seated himself and took from the bundle an accordion. he set it upon his knee and began polling and pushing on it. he did what mr. strubo said was doling a dull full tune. everyone took it good naturally.
675,7511-102420-0029.flac," for a while, walking was easy, and we made pretty good time. then we had a rocky hill to get over. we had to use careful when we got into the timber. there were marshy places which tried us sorely."
676,7511-102420-0018.flac," and mr. strubel and mrs. o'shaughnessy the other. we were to meet where the valley terminated in a broad pass. we felt sure we could get a chance at what out there might be in the valley. we were following fresh tracks, and a little of the hunter's enthusiasm seized me."
677,7511-102420-0002.flac," one of the main reasons i came on this hunt was to take the trip for you and to tell you things that you would most enjoy. so i will spend this snowy day in writing to you. on the night of september 30th, there was the most awful thunderstorm i ever witnessed."
678,7511-102420-0042.flac," that i hated anyone to see me and my head ached for two days. it has been snowing for a long time, but clyde says he will take me hunting when it stops."
679,7511-102420-0022.flac," began to move slowly. i couldn't believe my eyes. i shut them a moment, but when i looked, the grove was moving faster. it slid swiftly, and i could plainly hear the rattle of stones, falling against stones, until with a muffled roar"
680,7511-102420-0040.flac," and the way you held your gun, it is a wonder you didn't knock your head off, instead of just smashing your jaw. the men worked as fast as they could at the elk, and we helped as much as we could, but it was dark before we reached camp."
681,7511-102420-0032.flac," the elk will be here long before the men, since the men have no horses. so let's hurry and get placed along the only place they can get out. we'll get our limit. we hastily secreted ourselves along the narrow gorge through which the elk must pass."
682,7511-102420-0023.flac," the whole hillside fell into the stream. mr. haines came running back. what's the matter? are you hurt? why didn't you shoot?"" he asked. i waved my hand weekly toward where the great mound of tangled trees and earth blocked the water."
683,7511-102420-0045.flac," his nose, however, seems to upset the original plan, for it is long and thin and bent slightly to one side. his neck is long, and his atom's apple seems uncertain as to where it belongs. at supper, jareen watched it."
684,7511-102420-0019.flac," we had not followed them far when three cows and a spike came running out of the pines a little ahead of us. instantly, mr. haines's gun flew to his shoulder and a deafening report jared our ears. he ran forward"
685,7511-102420-0011.flac, greenish amber light and a blue gray sky. far ahead of us we could see the red room rock of a mountain above timberline. the first rays of the sun turned the jagged peaks into golden points of a crown. in oklahoma
686,7511-102420-0047.flac," although i can't brag about mr. murray's appearance, i can't about his taste, for he admires mrs. o'shaughnessy. it seems that in years gone by he has made attempts to marry her. as he got up from supper the first night he was with us, he said,"
687,7511-102419-0033.flac," while they were gone, we helped elizabeth to dress. all the while mrs. oshanasi was admonishing her to name her first girl mary ellen, or she said,"
688,7511-102419-0031.flac," we had just got the coffee boiling when the lovers came up, elizabeth in the saddle, learning to ride, and he walking beside her, holding her hand. how happy they were! the rest of us were mighty nearest foolish as they."
689,7511-102419-0026.flac," mr. stewart said we might as well noon as soon as we came to a good place, and then he would ride across and see mr. white. just as we rounded the hill, a horseman came toward us, a splendid fellow he was,"
690,7511-102419-0009.flac," and i never saw such people. you are just like your country. you have fed me, cared for me, and befriended me, a stranger."
691,7511-102419-0001.flac, but i have a chance today so i will not let it pass unused. we are in the last camp right on the hunting ground in the midst of the fray. we have said goodbye to deer elizabeth and i must tell you about her because she really comes first.
692,7511-102419-0044.flac," there is plenty of wood, water, and feed, and looking eastward down the valley, snow-covered crag-topped mountains delight the eye. the air is so bracing that we all feel equal to anything."
693,7511-102419-0029.flac," instead of letting me enjoy the tablo, he solemnly drove on, saying he would not want anyone gawking at him if he were the happy man. anyway, he couldn't urge chubb fast enough to prevent my seeing and hearing what i've told you."
694,7511-102419-0042.flac," our tents are set under some big trees on a small plateau, and right below us is a valley in which grass grows knee-high and little streams come from every way. trout, scurry up stream whenever we go near."
695,7511-102419-0038.flac," and i could hear her imploring all the saints to preserve us from instant death. i kept shutting my eyes, trying not to see the terrifying places, and opening them again to see the beauty spread everywhere. until mr. stewart said,"
696,7511-102419-0027.flac," manly strength and grace showing in every line. the road was narrow against the hillside and he had to ride quite close, so i saw his handsome face plainly. as soon as he saw elizabeth, he sprang from his saddle and said, lisbeth! lisbeth!"
697,7511-102419-0055.flac," and are all willing to help. i don't think i shall be able to tell you of any great exploits i make with the gun. i fired one that mr. stewart carries, and it almost kicked my shoulder off. i am mystified about mrs. o'shaughnessy's license."
698,7511-102419-0006.flac," there were many small lakes and the ducks and geese were noisily enjoying themselves among the rushes and water grasses. beyond the river rose the forest-covered mountains, hill upon hill. elizabeth dressed with a special care that morning,"
699,7511-102419-0015.flac," 18 months ago, father died, gently went to sleep. i waited six months and then wrote to wallace, but received no reply."
700,7511-102419-0017.flac," suppose in its married your man is. wallace may have changed his mind about me, but he would not marry without telling me. if he is alive, he is honorable. then i asked,"
701,7511-102419-0053.flac," he looks to be about 40 years old, but whoops and laughs like he was about 10. i don't need to tell you of the good man, do i? he is just the kind, quiet, good man that he has always been since i have known him."
702,7511-102419-0018.flac," if he had stationed in the bridges reserve, they would be sure to know of him at any of these little places. i just didn't have the courage to. i should never have told you what i have, only i think i owe it to you, and it was easier because of the haunts."
703,7511-102419-0021.flac, to inspect our license and to tell us about our privileges and our duties as good woodsmen. he also issues licenses in case hunters have neglected to secure them before coming. mrs. o'shaunasi had refused to get a license when we did.
704,7511-102419-0014.flac," i could take care of father and teach also. we were very comfortably situated, and in time, became really happy. although i seldom heard from wallace, his letters were well worth waiting for, and i knew he was doing well."
705,7511-102419-0054.flac, he told mr. haines he was too timid to seek and to bell. so we had to come without him.
706,7511-102419-0050.flac," as he had heard they were fine eating, having strata of fat alternating with strata of lean. mr. haynes is a quiet fellow just interested in hunting. mr. strubel is the big man of the party."
707,7511-102419-0019.flac," i am so glad we met them. so we drove along, talking together. we each assured the girl of our entire willingness to have her as a member of the family. after a while, i got on to the wagon with mr. stewart and told him elizabeth's story."
708,7511-102419-0040.flac, from there the hunters would ride horseback as far up as they could and then climb. it was almost sundown when we reached camp. all the hunters were in and such a yelling as they set up.
709,7511-102419-0045.flac, mr. strubel has already killed to find spiked elk for camp eating. we camped in a bunch and we have camp stoves so that in case of rain or snow we can stay indoors. just now we have a huge campfire.
710,7511-102419-0030.flac," besides that, i saw that elizabeth's hat was on a rye, her hair and disorder, and her eyes red. it was disappointing after she had been so careful to look nicely. mrs. o'shaunasi came trotting along and we stopped for dinner."
711,7511-102419-0039.flac, it must make you nervous to ride over mountain roads. don't bat your eyes so fast and you'll see more. so then i stiffen my back and kept my eyes open and i did see more. it had been decided to go as far as we could with the wagons and then set camp.
712,7511-102419-0007.flac," and very pretty she looked in her neat shepherd's plaid suit, and nattie little white canvas hat. very soon she said, i hope neither of you will misunderstand me when i tell you that if my hopes are realized, i will not ride with you much longer."
713,7511-102419-0034.flac," which was me name before i was married to me man, god rest his soul. dear elizabeth, she was glad to get away, i suspect. she and her wallace made a fine couple as they rode away in the golden september afternoon."
714,7511-102419-0052.flac," not to mention carrying the heavy gun. they are using the largest caliber sporting guns, murderous-looking things. that is, all except mr. harcredder, the picture man."
715,7511-102419-0047.flac, but they are delicious. yesterday we had pie made of wild currents. there are a powerful lot of them here. there is also a little blueberry that the men say is the rocky mountain huckleberry. the grouse are feeding on them.
716,7511-102419-0012.flac," before i was through school, i was to have been married, but i lost my mother just then and was left the care of my paralytic father. if i had married then, i should have had to take father from his familiar surroundings, because wallace came west in the forestry service."
717,7511-102419-0016.flac," i could bear it no longer and have come to see what has become of him. if he is dead, may i stay on with one of you and perhaps get a school? i want to live here always. but darland said mrs. o'shaughnessy."
718,7511-102419-0041.flac," look who's here! see who's come, they yelp! they went to work setting up tents and unloading wagons with a hearty goodwill. we are count just on the edge of the pines. back of us rises a big pine-clad mountain."
719,7511-102419-0056.flac," i know she would not shoot one of those big guns for a dozen elk. besides that, she is very tender-hearted, and will never harm anything herself, although she likes to join her hunts. i think you must be tired of this letter, so i am going to say goodnight, my friend."
720,7511-102419-0037.flac," but as the whole way was carpeted by strawberry vines and there were late berries to tempt me to loiter, i had to stay on the wagon. i had no idea a wagon could be got across such places. mr. strubel drove for mrs. o'shaunasey,"
721,7511-102419-0051.flac, he is tall and strong and we find him very pleasant company. then there is dr. teschall. he is a quiet fellow with an unexpected smile. he is so reserved that i felt that he was kind of out of place among the rest until i caught his cordial smile.
722,7511-102419-0043.flac, we call the valley paradise valley because it is the horse's paradise and as in the early morning we can often see clouds rolling along the valley. we call our camp cloudcrust we have a beautiful place. it is well sheltered and
723,7511-102419-0004.flac," the mountains on one side were crested. great crags and piles of rock crowned them as far as we could see. timber grew only about halfway up. the trunks of the quaking aspens shone silvery in the early sunlight, and their leaves were shimmering gold."
724,7511-102419-0005.flac," and the stately pines kept whispering and murmuring. it almost seemed as if they were chiding the quaking aspens for being frivolous. on the other side of the road lay the river, bordered by willows and grassy flats."
725,7511-102419-0013.flac," i felt that it wouldn't be right. poor father couldn't speak, but his eyes told me how grateful he was to stay. we had our little home and father had his pension, and i was able to get a small school near us."
726,7511-102419-0003.flac, the sky was clear blue.
727,7511-102419-0022.flac," she said she was not going to hunt. she told us we could give her a small piece of ilk and that would do. so we were rather surprised when she purchased two licenses, one a special, which would entitle her to a bull elk."
728,7511-102419-0035.flac," i believe she is one happy bride that the sun shone on, if the omen has failed everywhere else. well, we felt powerfully reduced in numbers, but about three o'clock that afternoon we came upon mr. strubel and mr. haynes,"
729,7511-102419-0010.flac," mrs. o'shaughnessy said, tut, tut, there's nothing at all we've done. tis a comfort you've been, hasn't she, mrs. stewart? i could hardly agree, and elizabeth went on, the way i've been received, and the way we all treated mrs. holt,"
730,7511-102419-0025.flac," and was trying to quiet her. the road along there was very rough. staying on the wagon occupied all my attention for a while. several miles were passed when we came inside of a beautiful cabin, half hidden in a grove of pines beyond the river."
731,7511-102419-0028.flac," she held her hands to him and said, oh, just riding with friends! then to mrs. o'shaunasey, she said, this is my wallace. mr. stewart is the queerest man."
732,7511-102419-0008.flac, i never saw such a country as the west.
733,7511-102419-0000.flac," camp cloudcrest september 12, 1914. dear mrs. coney,"

773,1898-145715-0009.flac," the voice was that of a young man, and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered, led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming, but this had to be a mere matter of fancy, for no one was visible."
774,1898-145715-0033.flac," which stood at no great distance. here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white to match the house, which apparently belonged to her, and of which she seemed the only inhabitant."

781,1898-145715-0044.flac, on opening it found that all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof and at once began playing melodiously.
782,1898-145715-0017.flac," as to certain death. as she was crossing a wood, a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble, which she would find in a fountain close by, and to use it when needed."
783,1898-145715-0004.flac, she felt a little reassured and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her.
784,1898-145715-0002.flac, she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left.
785,1898-145715-0022.flac," and for some time, the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together. one day, prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe. he had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot, but he had no idea where he was to go."
786,1898-145715-0047.flac," in the first and most splendid of these carriages, set prince rainbow's mother. she fondly embraced her son, after which she informed him that his father had been dead for some years, that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased,"
787,1898-145715-0048.flac," and that he might return in peace to reign over his people who were longing for his presence. the court received the new king with joyful acclimesions, which would have delighted him at any other time."

789,1898-145715-0015.flac," for fire, with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out. now this lucrino's was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across, and especially enjoyed a chance of catching."
790,1898-145715-0026.flac," the prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations and promised to neglect nothing, which might help to deliver his dearer fairer than a fairy from her captivity and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free."
791,1898-145715-0013.flac," could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions. the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow, and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves."
792,1898-145715-0012.flac, he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairer than a fairy. he added many other tender speeches to this declaration and the princess to whom such remarks worry new experience.
793,1898-145715-0029.flac," as she did so, this friggin' mortal she carried touched the ground, and immediately a green and shady bower sprang up around her in which she hoped to sleep in peace. but lagrey had not given up her pursuit, and she was still a little bit more than she was."
794,1898-145715-0030.flac," and arrived just as fairer than a fairy had fallen fast asleep. this time she made sure of catching her victim, but the cat spied her out."

796,1898-145724-0037.flac," and lasted till the approach of winter, when the flare queen's daughter went back again to her mother."
797,1898-145724-0034.flac," when the flower queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the prince, she said to him, i will give my consent to your marriage gladly, but my daughter can only stay with you in summer. in winter, when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow,"
798,1898-145724-0007.flac, and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid. so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home.
799,1898-145724-0014.flac," would like to enter her surface. his flattering speech pleased the dragons, and the eldest of them said, well, you may come with me, and i will take you to the mother dragon."""
800,1898-145724-0018.flac, we will eat you up. the prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow.
801,1898-145724-0036.flac, when the flora queen's daughter departed and went home to her mother.
802,1898-145724-0017.flac, very well.
803,1898-145724-0008.flac," and his horse had died of exhaustion, while he himself had suffered much from want and misery, but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of. at last one day he came to a hut in front of which set a very old man."
804,1898-145724-0029.flac," in a moment, the king of the fishes appeared and said to him, i know quite well what you want me to do. and i will summon all the fishes of the sea together."
805,1898-145724-0020.flac," and taking it out of his pocket, he rang it once. in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him, and the king of the eagles sank at his feet."
806,1898-145724-0030.flac," she said to him, you are a brave youth, and i will make you my body servant. but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with?"
807,1898-145724-0026.flac," the ball came to an end at midnight, and early next morning the prince again led the mother-dregans mare out into the meadow. but again, she vanished before his eyes. then he took out his little bell and rang it twice."
808,1898-145724-0019.flac," and that last indesperer sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate. as he sat thus, lost in thought, he noticed an eagle flying over his head. then he suddenly befought him of his little bell."
809,1898-145724-0011.flac," he asked him the same question and the old man answered, no?"
810,1898-145724-0027.flac," and again she led him to the ballroom. the flower queen's daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound, and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear, if you succeed again tomorrow, wait for me with the full in the meadow."
811,1898-145724-0004.flac, which deserves to be rewarded. would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife? most certainly i would! reply the prince. so the old woman continued.
812,1898-145724-0023.flac, who was full of wonder when she saw him and said
813,1898-145724-0006.flac," the king of the eagles will appear. if you ring it twice, the king of the foxes will come to you. and if you ring it three times, you will see the king of the fishes by your side."
814,1898-145724-0032.flac," the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower-queens dwelling. but the dragons had noticed their flight, and woke their brother out of his year's sleep. he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened."
815,1898-145724-0031.flac," the prince begged for a full of the mare, which the mother dragon at once gave him, and over and above, a cloak made of gold, for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty. so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak."
816,1898-145724-0002.flac," over there, at the edge of the forest, in the little hut you see in the distance."" replyed the old woman. the prince lifted her onto his horse, and soon they reached the hut where the old woman got down, and turning to the prince said,"
817,1898-145724-0000.flac," to his astonishment, he found an old woman who begged him to help her out of the ditch. the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there. my son."
818,1898-145724-0003.flac," just wait a moment, and i will give you something."" and she disappeared into her hut, but returned very soon and said, ""...you are a mighty prince, but at the same..."""
819,1898-145724-0016.flac," and, added to it all, she had three heads. her appearance was a great shock to the prince, and so was her voice, which was like the croaking of many ravens. she asked him"
820,1898-145724-0028.flac," after the ball, we will fly away together."" on the third day, the prince led the mare to the meadow again, but once more she vanished before his eyes. then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times."
821,1898-145724-0035.flac," she must come and live with me in my palace underground."" the prince consented to this, and led his beautiful bride-home, where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence. the young couple lived happily together till winter came."
822,1898-145724-0015.flac," they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls, all made of golden diamonds. in the twelfth room, they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond throne. she was the..."
823,1898-145724-0021.flac," the bird said, you are looking for the mother dragon's mare, who is galloping all about among the clouds. i will summon all the eagles of the air together, and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you. and with these words, the king of the eagles flew away."
824,1898-145724-0022.flac," towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air, and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them. they sank at his feet onto the ground and gave the mare over to him. then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon,"
825,1898-145724-0025.flac," here too was the flower queen's beautiful daughter. her dress was woven, added the most lovely flowers in the world, and her complexion was like lilies and roses. as the prince was dancing with her, he managed to whisper in her ear."
826,1898-145724-0012.flac, with thlymaned windows. he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard.
827,1898-145724-0013.flac," when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted. the prince replied,"
828,1898-145724-0005.flac," who has been captured by a dragon. if you wish to marry her, you must first set her free, and this i will help you to do. i will give you this little bell if you bring it once."
829,1898-145724-0010.flac," the prince thanked him for his information and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road, and at the end of it came to the little hut where he found a very old man."
830,1898-145724-0001.flac," answered the old woman, i am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight, i set out for the neighboring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning. but i lost my way in the dark."
831,1898-145724-0009.flac," no, i do not. answer the old men."
832,1898-145724-0024.flac," she gave him, at the same time, a cloak made of copper."
833,1898-145702-0016.flac," pointing at the signatures said, i will take you underground with me. you shall have a meal there. if you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat, you shall be free."
834,1898-145702-0010.flac," if you would help yourselves, one of you must go into the wood, and there he will come upon a tumble-down building of rocks, which looks like a little house. he must go in, and there he will find help."" the two melancholy ones, that."
835,1898-145702-0019.flac, do you know what your wine glass shall be? and old horses who have shabby our wine glass.
836,1898-145702-0007.flac," they went into a field, sat down, and the two pulled long faces. an old woman passed by and asked them why they were so sad."
837,1898-145702-0009.flac," and how he had given the money as plentifully as blackberries, but as they had signed their names they were his, unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle. the old woman said,"
838,1898-145702-0015.flac," and how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle. then they were all delighted, and in high spirits took out their whip and cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground. when the seven years had quite gone, the fiend came with his book and"
839,1898-145702-0005.flac," then he put a book before them, which he made all three of them sign. i will then give you a riddle."" he said, ""...if you guess it, you shall be free and out of my power."" the dragon then flew away."
840,1898-145702-0014.flac," i know enough and can help myself splendidly. then he went by another way through the window secretly, and in all haste back to his comrades. he told them how the dragon had been outwitted by his grandmother."
841,1898-145702-0000.flac," one of them said to the others. if we are caught, we shall be hanged on the gallows. how shall we set about it?"" the other said, ""...do you see that large cornfield there?"""
842,1898-145702-0001.flac," if we were to hide ourselves in that, no one could find us. the army cannot come into it, and tomorrow it is to march on."" they crept into the corn, but the army did not march on, but remained in camped clothes around them."
843,1898-145702-0011.flac," that won't save us, and they remained where they were. but the third of mary-wan jumped up and went into the wood till he found the rock hut. in the hut, sat a very old woman who was the dragon's grandmother."
844,1898-145702-0013.flac," i will tell you this. in the north sea lies a dead sea cat. that shall be their roast meat, and the rib of a whale, that shall be their silver spoon, and the hollow foot of a dead horse. that shall be their wine glass."
845,1898-145702-0002.flac," they sat for two days and two nights in the corn, and grew so hungry that they nearly died. but if they were to venture out, it was certain death. they said it last."
846,1898-145702-0017.flac, then said the first soldier.
847,1898-145702-0012.flac," she asked him how he came and what was his business there. he told her all that happened, and because she was pleased with him, she took compassion on him."
848,1898-145702-0006.flac," and they journeyed on with their little whip. they had as much money as they wanted, wore grand clothes, and made their way into the world. wherever they went, they lived in merry-making and splendor, drove about with horses and carriages, eight and drank, but did nothing wrong."
849,1898-145702-0004.flac," said they. then the dragon seized them in his claws, took them through the air over the army, and set them down on the earth a long way from it. he gave them a little whip, saying,"
850,1898-145702-0008.flac, only confide your trouble in me.
851,1898-145702-0003.flac," what use was it our deserting? we must perish here miserably. once they were speaking, a fiery dragon came flying through the air."
852,1898-145702-0018.flac, the dragon made a face and growled again three times. hmm! hmm!
853,1898-145720-0004.flac," so the next morning he got up early and put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders, for he knew not how long his journey would take, nor what sort of country he would have to go through. only one thing he knew."
854,1898-145720-0011.flac, but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him.
855,1898-145720-0001.flac," many of the young brave sought her in marriage, but she would listen to one only—a handsome chief who had taken her fancy some years before. so they were to be married, and great rejoicings were made."
856,1898-145720-0002.flac," but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid, thinking of his happiness that was buried there. at last, after many days, a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness."
857,1898-145720-0006.flac," but grew less and less the further he went south, till it disappeared altogether. soon the trees put forth their beds, and flowers sprang up under his feet, and instead of the clouds there was blue sky over his head, and everywhere the birds were singing."
858,1898-145720-0014.flac," when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own, the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey. but they could not touch each other for between them rolled great waves, which looked as if they would sink the boats."
859,1898-145720-0012.flac," instead of hiding as he approached and bird circled around him,"
860,1898-145720-0018.flac, at the gate my messenger awaits you and you shall take again.
861,1898-145720-0017.flac," but, in the murmur of the wind, he heard the master of life saying to him, return whether you came, for i have worked for you to do, and your people need you, and for many years you shall rule over them."
862,1898-145720-0003.flac," he remembered having heard from the old, old people of the tribe that there was a path that led to the land of souls. that if you sought carefully, you could find it."
863,1898-145720-0010.flac, at the water which lies far out yonder in the plains which stretch beyond.
864,1898-145720-0000.flac, far away in north america where the red indians dwell.
865,1898-145720-0016.flac," so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island and wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams, and they knew not hunger nor thirst, neither cold nor heat."
866,1898-145720-0007.flac, and on the top of these he found a hut or a wig one. and all men clothed in skins and holding his staff in his hand stood in the doorway.
867,1898-145720-0013.flac," very soon he noticed with wonder that neither rox nor trees barred his path. he passed through them without knowing it. for indeed, they were not rox and trees at all, but only the souls of them. for this was the land of shadows."
868,1898-145720-0009.flac," to suffer him to rest, and when he rose, the old man rose too, and stood with him at the door. look, he said."
869,1898-145720-0015.flac," only the children had no fear and reached the other side in safety. still, though, the chief and the young girl quiled in terror at these horrible sights and sands. no harm came to them for their lives had been free from evil."
870,1898-145720-0008.flac," rest in my hut, she also rested, and i will tell you what you ask, and wither you should go."" on hearing these words, the young man entered the hut, but his heart was too eager within him,"
871,1898-145720-0005.flac," one of the old men say that the land of souls lay to the south, and so, filled with new hope and courage, he set his face southwards. for many, many miles, the country looked the same as it did around his own home."
872,2436-2481-0018.flac, nor did prince. her scream awakened him.
873,2436-2481-0034.flac," why, we must get him!"" i gathered my wits. a surge of hate swept me, a wild desire for vengeance. why, by god, where is he?"
874,2436-2481-0029.flac," and hear him, i don't want to kill you, helgen. we need you."" he gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms, carried me swiftly across the deserted deck."
875,2436-2481-0023.flac," someone outside trying to unseal the door. in the darkness, cylinder in hand, i crept softly from the bunk, crouched at the door. this time, i would capture or kill this night prowl."
876,2436-2481-0024.flac," the sizzling was faintly audible. my door sealed, breaking. upon impulse, i reached for the door, jerked it open. no one there."
877,2436-2481-0020.flac," it had only a bunk, my tiny desk, a chair, and clothes robe. there was no evidence of any intruder here. i set my door and window alarm. then i audio-phone to the radio room. snap? yes."
878,2436-2481-0028.flac," it caught me, ran like ice through my veins, seized and numbed my limbs. i felt helpless to the deck, nerves and muscles paralyzed. my tongue was thick and inert. i could not speak nor move."
879,2436-2481-0025.flac," was empty. but i leapt and struck a solid body, crouching in the doorway. a giant man."
880,2436-2481-0000.flac," dr. frank's face had gone white. snaps stood like a statue of horror. the deck here was patched, as always, with silver radiance from the deck ports. the empty deck chairs stood about. the scream"
881,2436-2481-0032.flac," she told us before she died. died! i left to my feet. she... died. yes, greg. now we're her go."
882,2436-2481-0012.flac," i'll be there presently, greg. he slammed the door upon me. i followed his orders, but it was like a dream of horror. the turmoil of the ship gradually quieted. snap went to the radio room."
883,2436-2481-0016.flac," had opened a needous corridor door. wasn't it sealed? yes, but the intruder opened it. burst it?"
884,2436-2481-0026.flac," his electronized metallic robe burned my hands. i lunged against him. i was almost as surprised as he. i shot, but the stab of heat evidently missed him. the shock of my encounter short-circuited his robe. he materialized in the starlight. a brief."
885,2436-2481-0037.flac," the door of the shining garden was closed, a brief glimpse given to me into her of what might have been. and now."
886,2436-2481-0027.flac," savage encounter. he struck the weapon for my hand. he had dropped his hydrogen torch and tried to grip me but i twisted away from his hold. so it's you quiet great, belgian. i only want to talk without warning a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand"
887,2436-2481-0006.flac," moa, with a night robe drawn tight around her thin, tall figure, edged up to me. what has happened, setsile jan?"
888,2436-2481-0001.flac," was still. but now we heard a commotion inside, the rasp of opening cabin doors, questions from frightened passengers. i found my voice. anita! anita prince! come on!"
889,2436-2481-0015.flac," dr. frank and her brother are with her. they're doing all they can. he told us what had happened. anita and george prince had both been asleep, each in his respective room. someone unknown."
890,2436-2481-0017.flac," it wasn't broken. the assailant opened it somehow, an assaulted misprints. shutter in the chest with a heat ray. her left lung. shutter? yes. but she did not see who did it."
891,2436-2481-0009.flac," he admitted the older officer and slammed the door upon me again. and, immediately, reopened it. greg, keep the passengers quieted. tell them everything's all right. miss prince got frightened. that's all. then go to the turret."
892,2436-2481-0035.flac," dr. frank gripped me. the captain said gently, we know how you feel greg. she told us before she died. i'll bring him in here to you, but i'll kill him i tell you. no you won't, lad."
893,2436-2481-0022.flac, tortured sleep. i was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer. someone was tampering with my door. then the buzzer ceased. the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it. but it had done its work. awaken to me.
894,2436-2481-0014.flac, but why? by whom? had george prince been in his own room when the attack came? i thought now i recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with dr. frank.
895,2436-2481-0003.flac," passengers standing at their cabin doors. i shouted, go back to your rooms. we want order here. keep back! we came to the twin doors of a22 and a20. both were closed. dr. frank was in advance of snap in me now."
896,2436-2481-0004.flac, he paused at the sound of captain carter's voice behind us. was it from in there? wait a moment. carter dashed up. he had a large heat ray projector in his hand. he shoved his aside. let me in first. is the door sealed?
897,2436-2481-0011.flac," i don't mean that. tell snap to watch his radio room, arm yourselves and guard our weapons. i stammered. if she dies, will you flash us word? he stared at me strangely."
898,2436-2481-0002.flac," he was dashing for the lounge archway. dr. frank and i followed. i realized that we passed the deck door of window of a-22, but they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside."
899,2436-2481-0036.flac," we don't want him killed. not attacked even. not yet. we'll explain later. they sat me down, calming me. anita. dead."
900,2436-2481-0030.flac," his warning siren rang out to alert the ship. his spotlight clung to us. meeko ran with me a few steps, then he cursed and dropped me. flood away. i fell like a sack of carbide to the deck."
901,2436-2481-0021.flac, i told him about anita. carter cut in on us from the chart room. stop that you fools! we cut off. fully dressed. i flung myself on my bed. anita might die. i must have fallen into it.
902,2436-2481-0031.flac," my tongue was thick, but it moved. yes. i was soon revived. i sat up with dr. frank vigorously rubbing me. i'm all right. i told them what had happened."
903,2436-2481-0013.flac, blackstone and i sat in the tiny chart room. how much time passed. i do not know. i was confused. anita hurt. she might die. murdered.
904,2436-2481-0008.flac," the captain rast. get out, helgen!"
905,2436-2481-0007.flac," i could see only carter, but i heard the murmuring voice of dr. frank."
906,2436-2481-0019.flac, i was glad enough to get away. i would lie down for an hour and then go to anita's state room. i demand that dr. frank let me see her. i went to the stern deck where my cubby was located. my mind was...
907,2436-2481-0033.flac, miko got into her state room and tried to force his love upon her. she repulsed him. he killed her. it struck me blank. and then with a rush kin of thought.
908,2436-2481-0005.flac," dr. frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon snap in me. i was unarmed. weapon in hand, snap forced the panic-stricken passengers back to their rooms. snap reassured them, glibly."
909,2436-2481-0010.flac, tell blackstone what's happened. but i don't know what's happened. carter was grim and white.
910,2436-2476-0005.flac," i went to my cabin. it was located aft on the stern deck near the stern watch tower. a small, middle room with a chair, a desk, and a bunk. i made sure no one was in it. i sealed the lettuce grill in the door."
911,2436-2476-0025.flac," i answered her greeting, and met george prince's casual gaze. he too smiled, as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service i had done her. or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when i chased him."
912,2436-2476-0004.flac," but why didn't johnson hear that eavesdropper? and what was he doing there anyway at that hour of the morning? the captain ignored my questions. i'm going to have that prince sweet searched. we can't be too careful. go to bed, greg. you need rest."
913,2436-2476-0034.flac, the martian equivalent of mr. and miss.
914,2436-2476-0006.flac, set the alarm trigger against any opening of them and went to bed. the siren for the midday meal awakened me. i had slept heavily. i felt refreshed. i found the passengers already assembled at my table when i arrived in the dining salon.
915,2436-2476-0009.flac," a flight ordinarily of some ten days. there were five tables in the dining-salon, each with eight seats. snap and i had one of the tables. we sat at the ends, with the passengers on each of the sides."
916,2436-2476-0019.flac," ideal in tricks, not a fool in audience. his keen, amused gaze was on opan. this gentleman from venus and i have too much in common to argue."
917,2436-2476-0033.flac," she looked as all martians liked to look, a very warlike amazon, but she was a pretty girl. she smiled at me with a keen eyed direct gaze. mr. dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome. you are."
918,2436-2476-0010.flac," greg, this is sero abhan. i met the keen somber gaze of a venus man of middle age. a small, slim, graceful man was sleek black hair. his pointed face, accentuated by the pointed beard, was pallet."
919,2436-2476-0016.flac," and as a matter of fact, we even argument greg. blast snap. this is sir arthur coniston, an english gentleman, lecturer, and sky trotter. that is, he will be a sky trotter, he tells us he plans a number of voyages."
920,2436-2476-0011.flac," upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament, a device like a star and a cross entwined. i am happy to meet you, sir. his voice was soft and deep. abhan, i repeated."
921,2436-2476-0027.flac," my attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table. i heard o'han's silky voice. we passed quite close to the moon last night, mr. dean. yes, said snap. we did, didn't we? always do."
922,2436-2476-0039.flac," inadvertently pushed back his robe to bear his forearm, an instant only, then it dropped to his wrist. but in that instant i had seen, upon the gray flesh, a thin seer turned red, a very recent burn."
923,2436-2476-0018.flac," the third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument. snap introduced him as rance rankin, an american, a quiet, blonde fellow of 35 or 40. i ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on."
924,2436-2476-0003.flac," when i mentioned the person who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night, and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled past, carter looked startled. johnson is all right, greg. does he know anything about this grant line affair? no."
925,2436-2476-0000.flac," i told him what snap and i had learned. the rays from the moon, proving that grantline had concentrated a considerable or body. i also told him of grantline's message. we'll stop on the way back as he directs greg. he bent closer to me."
926,2436-2476-0029.flac, and i've never seen so keen a glance as ranc can shot at me. were all three people aware of grant line's treasure on the moon? it suddenly seemed so. i wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over. captain carter was right.
927,2436-2476-0014.flac, has just termed it fetishism.
928,2436-2476-0013.flac," my mission is that all the universe shall hear of me."" he's preaching the religion of the venus mystics, snap explained. and this enlightened gentleman set up hand ironically, nodding to the man."
929,2436-2476-0015.flac, protested the man at all handside.
930,2436-2476-0035.flac," not spindly, like most martians, this fellow, for all his seven-feet in height was almost heavy set. he wore a plated leather jerkin beneath his robe, and knee-pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed his gray, hairy pillars of strength."
931,2436-2476-0038.flac," had a touch of martian accent, worn almost away by living for some years in greater new york. the shock to me came within a few minutes."
932,2436-2476-0020.flac," i'd like to eat in quiet, arguing passengers always annoy me. there were still three seats vacant on our table, and wonder who would occupy them. i soon learned the answer, for one seat at least. rankin said calmly."
933,2436-2476-0037.flac, both martians and venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists.
934,2436-2476-0031.flac, when another incident shocked me. the two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats. a martian girl and man. the girl had the seat at my left with a man beside her. all martians are tall.
935,2436-2476-0023.flac," as a man who looked hardly 25. he was at this moment evidently in a game-mode. his clean-cut, handsome profile with its poetic dark curls."
936,2436-2476-0026.flac," i gazed after his small white-suited figure as he followed anita from the salon. in thinking of her, i prayed that carter and halsey might be wrong. whatever piloting against the grant mine expedition might be going on, i would like to thank you for your support."
937,2436-2476-0032.flac," the girl was about my own height, that is, six feet, two inches. the man was seven feet or more. both wore the martian outer robe. the girl flung hers back. her limbs were encased in pseudo-male."
938,2436-2476-0012.flac," i should have heard of you no doubt, but a smile plucked at his thin grey lips."
939,2436-2476-0017.flac," the tall englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgement. my compliments mr. haljinn. i hope you have no strong religious convictions, else we will make your table here very miserable."
940,2436-2476-0040.flac, as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm. my mind flung back. only last night in the city-cord or snap and i had been followed by a martian. i had shot at him with a heat ray. i thought i had hit him on the arm.
941,2436-2476-0021.flac," his glance went to the empty seat at my right hand. the venza, isn't that her name? he and i are destined for the same theater in farakshan. so venza was to sit beside me. he was good news."
942,2436-2476-0024.flac," there seemed little of the villain about him. and i saw anita prince now, as a dark-haired, black-eyed little beauty, in feature resembling her brother very strongly. she presently finished her meal. she rose with him after her."
943,2436-2476-0028.flac," it's a technical problem with the exigenesis of interstellar navigation. explain it to them, greg. you're an expert. i waived it away with a laugh. there was a brief silence. i could not help noticing sir arthur connison's queer look."
944,2436-2476-0008.flac," the moon had dwindled to a pinpoint of light beside the crescent earth, and behind them our sun blazed, visually the largest orb in the heavens. it was some 68 million miles from the earth to mars."
945,2436-2476-0036.flac," he had come into the salon with a swagger, his sword ornament clanking. a pleasant voyage so far, he said to me as he started his meal. his voice had the heavy, throaty, rasp characteristic of the martian. he spoke perfect english."
946,2436-2476-0022.flac," ten days of a religious argument three times a day would be intolerable, but the cheerful vencer would help. she never eats the midday meal, so it's not. she's on the deck having orange juice. i guess it's the old gag about diet, eh?"
947,2436-2476-0030.flac," coming back, we should have a cordon of interplanetary police aboard. sir arthur broke the awkward silence. magnificent sight, the moon, from so close. though i was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it."
948,2436-2476-0001.flac," at farakshan, i'm going to bring back a cordon of interplanetary police. the secret will be out, of course, when we stop at the moon. we have no right, even now, to be flying this vessel as unguarded as it is. he was very solemn."
949,2436-2476-0007.flac," it was a low-voltered metal room with blue and yellow tube lights. at its sides, the oval windows showed the deck, with its ports on the domeside, through which a vista of the stary firmament was visible. we were well on our course to mars."
950,2436-2476-0002.flac, and he was grim when i told him of the invisible eavesdropper. you think he overheard grantline's message? who was it? you seem to feel it was george prince? i told him i was convinced the prowler went into a20.
951,2436-2477-0000.flac," i was, i think, of the planeteris officers the most expert handler of the mathematical calculators. the locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was, under ordinary circumstances, about all i had to do."
952,2436-2477-0030.flac, then wanted to know what kind of a ship this was. why? because shaq has a cute little eavesdropping microphone of his own. he had it working last night. he overheard george prints in that...
953,2436-2477-0028.flac," they had a wonderful game with that englishman sir arthur this morning. strip tim of half a pound of eight-inch leaves, a neat little stack, a cricket game of course. those fellows are more nimble-finger than rant's rank and ever dared to be."
954,2436-2477-0015.flac," but not within air-shot. why do you look so furtive, she retorted? greg, there's something strange about this voyage."
955,2436-2477-0001.flac," and it took only a few minutes every 12 hours. i had a moment with carter in the isolation of his chart room. this voyage, greg, i'm getting like you, too fanciful. we've normal group of passengers apparently."
956,2436-2477-0022.flac," i saw the purse or in the smoking room. he was visible from weight. vanzah, that prowler went through the smoking room. i know he did. i could hear him."
957,2436-2477-0005.flac," we'll all meet here, greg. say about the zero hour. we must take some precautions."" then he dismissed me. i found venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck. a porthole."
958,2436-2477-0017.flac," do you know opan?"" i interrupted. she shook her head. never heard of him. but he told me plenty at breakfast. by satan, what a flow of words that devil-driver can muster! he and the englishmen don't mesh very well, do they?"
959,2436-2477-0006.flac," with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her. there was an empty seat nearby. she greeted me with a venus form of jocular intimate greeting. hulla-lo, greg, sit here with me."
960,2436-2477-0029.flac," i sat staring at her. she was a mine of information, this girl. and greg, i tried my charms on checkin' dead. nice men, but dumb. whatever's going on, they're not in it."
961,2436-2477-0026.flac," i... well, i do trust you. really, i do. but the whole thing isn't mine to tell. the somber pools of her eyes were shining."
962,2436-2477-0021.flac," deflecting invisible cloak. you couldn't fool an audience with that. it's too commonplace. if france rankin tried, i gripped her. don't ramble, venza. you saw me? yes. my state room door was open. i was sitting with a cigarette."
963,2436-2477-0012.flac," she sat up to face me. there's a fellow here on the planetara, rance rankin, he calls himself, at our table, a big, good-looking, blonde american. he says he is a magician, ever here of him."
964,2436-2477-0035.flac," he's a man. find out what you can. she drew away from me abruptly. there's anita and george prince. they came to the corner of the deck, but turned back. thenza caught my look and understood it."
965,2436-2477-0023.flac," the purse her looked up, followed the sound with his gaze. i thought that was queer. he never made a move. and then you came along and he acted innocent. why? what's going on? that's what i want to know. i held my breath. vensa."
966,2436-2477-0003.flac, nothing unusual among his things. we searched both his room and his sisters. i did not follow that up. instead i told him about the burn on miko's thick arm. he stared. i wish we were at farakshan. greg.
967,2436-2477-0036.flac," she turned, solemn. you may be interested to know. she loves you. i could see it. i knew it when i mentioned you to her this morning. me? why, we've hardly spoken. is it necessary?"
968,2436-2477-0014.flac," if he's a professional entertainer, i'm a motor-oiler. it startled me. why do you say that? instinctively, my gaze swept the deck. an earthworm and child."
969,2436-2477-0018.flac, she stared at me. i had not answered her grin. my mind was too busy with queer fancies. all these words things are not always what they seem were these passengers masqueraders? were they put here by george prince?
970,2436-2477-0009.flac," well, don't be silly, venza. i enjoyed her. i gazed at her small, slim figure reclining in the deckchair. her long gray robe parted by design, i have no doubt, to display her shapely, satin, sheathed legs."
971,2436-2477-0034.flac," shaxe's current was interrupted. tell him to try it again, venser. i'll talk with him. no! i'd better let him alone. can you get him to keep his mouth shut?"
972,2436-2477-0025.flac," i saw the door open and close. i even thought i could see his blurred outline. she added, why should george prince be sneaking around with you after him? and the purse are acting innocent?"
973,2436-2477-0020.flac," they? anyone? something's going on. you know it. you are in it. i saw you this morning, greg. wild hide chasing a phantom. you? and i heard the phantom. a man's footsteps. a magnetic?"
974,2436-2477-0019.flac," i'd parried. i need a lot of things. what we've just been talking about. and what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning? excitement? greg, you may trust me. for the first time, she was wholly serious."
975,2436-2477-0002.flac," but i don't like the look of any of them. that obhan, a drawer table. snaky looking fellow, i commented. he and the englishmen are great on arguments. did you have princess cabin searched? my breath hung on his answer. yes."
976,2436-2477-0010.flac," her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot to the back of her neck. her carminelips were parted with a mucking, a luring smile. the exotic perfume of her enveloped me. she glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes."
977,2436-2477-0031.flac," i gasped, venza, softer. against all propriety of this public deck, she pretended to drape herself upon me. her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear."
978,2436-2477-0033.flac," a hundred pounds of gold leaf, that's the purse's price. he's with them, whatever it is. he promised to do something or other for them. she stopped. well, i prompted. that's all."
979,2436-2477-0013.flac," that's what he told me. no, i'd never heard of him. no, did i. and i thought i'd heard of every one of importance. he is listed for the same theater i am. nice sort of, philip."" she paused, then added."
980,2436-2477-0004.flac," tonight when the passengers are asleep come here to me. snap will be here, and dr. frank, we can trust him. he knows about the grant line treasure? yes, and so do balch and blackstone. balch and blackstone were our first and second officers."
981,2436-2477-0032.flac," something about treasure on the moon. shaq couldn't understand what, and they mentioned you. then the purseer joined them. her whispered words tumbled over one another."
982,2436-2477-0008.flac, no man will please me more.
983,2436-2477-0011.flac," be serious, i added. i am serious. sober intoxicated by you, but sober. i said, what's sort of a contract? a theater in ferrachon. good money, greg."
984,2436-2477-0007.flac," i have been wondering when you would come after me."" i sat down beside her. why are you going to mars, venza? i'm glad to see you. oh, many thanks. but i am glad to see you, greg. so handsome a man. who you know from venus to earth?"
985,2436-2477-0016.flac," so you must know it as well as i do."" ""'rant's rankin,' i prompted. she leaned closer toward me. he could fool you, but not me. i've known too many magicians,' she grinned. i challenged him to trick me."
986,2436-2477-0024.flac," where did the prowler run to? can you, she whispered calmly."
987,2436-2477-0027.flac, here's something i can tell you now. we've two high-class gold leaf gamblers aboard. do you know that? who are they? shack and dud artly. every detective in greater new york knows them.
988,405-130895-0026.flac," with vegetables from the sea, like the english with their irish stews. the nautilus passed over these lush, luxuriant depths with tremendous speed."
989,405-130895-0033.flac," between 20 and 25 meters, and went along the south american coast."
990,405-130895-0016.flac," now then, that evening it became obvious much to my satisfaction that we were returning north by the atlantic route. i shared the results of my observations with the canadian and conceal."
991,405-130895-0020.flac," the land of fire, a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the native's huts. this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long, and eighty leagues wide."
992,405-130895-0012.flac," yes, i replied, because we're going in the direction of the sun, and here the sun is due north. sure, nedland went on, but it remains to be seen whether we'll make for the atlantic or the pacific."
993,405-130895-0004.flac," and what powerful inhalations, the canadian drew like a furnace going full blast. our strength returned promptly, and when i looked around i saw that we were alone on the platform. no crewman."
994,405-130895-0037.flac, captain nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of brazil's popular shores because he shot by with dizzying speed.
995,405-130895-0031.flac," upside down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing. they swam with quiverings of their four leaf-like arms, letting the opulent dresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift."
996,405-130895-0023.flac," yes, sir, a natural barometer that didn't let me down when i navigated the narrows of the street of magellan. just then its peak appeared before us, standing out distinctly against the background of the skies. this forecast, fair weather."
997,405-130895-0003.flac," what fine oxygen! let master have no fears about breathing. there is enough for everyone. as for nedland, he didn't say a word, but his wide-open jaws would have scared off a shark."
998,405-130895-0002.flac," we could suck the atoms from the air by the lungful, and it was the breeze, the breeze itself that poured into us this luxurious intoxication. ah! conceal was putting in."
999,405-130895-0001.flac," next to me, my two companions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles. poor souls who have suffered from long starvation mustn't pounce heedlessly on the first food given them. we, on the other hand, didn't have to practice such moderation."
1000,405-130895-0009.flac," it took my breath away in a manner of—confounded by this lapse into banality, conceal left his sentence hanging. my friends, i replied, very moved."
1001,405-130895-0014.flac," soon we had cleared the antarctic circle, plus the permanentory of cape horn."
1002,405-130895-0030.flac," some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth, semi-sphoric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of 12 neat festoons. others looked like..."
1003,405-130895-0018.flac," will never regret having known him. especially once we've left him, that land shot back. the next day..."
1004,405-130895-0036.flac," near 11 o'clock in the morning we cut the tropic of capricorn on the 37th meridian, passing well out from cape frio. much to nedlands, this pleasure."
1005,405-130895-0027.flac," in these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae, in particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the world's best muscles."
1006,405-130895-0032.flac," shadows, illusions melting and evaporating outside their native element. when the last tips of the falkland islands had disappeared below the horizon,"
1007,405-130895-0008.flac," and you, my galant conceal, you suffered a great deal. not too much to be candid with master. i was lacking a few throatfuls of air, but i would have gotten by."
1008,405-130895-0029.flac," i likewise marveled at the numerous producers, including the most beautiful of their breed, the compass jellyfish, unique to the falkland seas."
1009,405-130895-0021.flac," its coastline looked flat, but high mountains rose in the distance. i even thought i glimpsed mount sarmiento."
1010,405-130895-0019.flac," when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon, we raised land to the west."
1011,405-130895-0035.flac," keeping to its northily heading, it followed the long windings of south america. by then we had fared sixteen thousand leagues, since coming on board in the seas of japan."
1012,405-130895-0015.flac, by then all our past sufferings were forgotten. the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds. we had thoughts only of the future.
1013,405-130895-0005.flac, those strange semen on the nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside. not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air. the first words i pronounced were words of appreciation
1014,405-130895-0017.flac," that's good news the canadian replied, but where's the nautilus going? i am unable to say, ned. after the south pole."
1015,405-130895-0028.flac," as for fish, i specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the gobi chinas, especially some gudgeon two decimeters long sprinkled with whitish and yellow spots."
1016,405-130895-0000.flac," from cape horn to the amazon. how i got onto the platform i'm unable to say. perhaps the canadian transferred me there, but i could breathe, i could inhale the life-giving seer."
1017,405-130895-0025.flac," it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mullisks, for crabs and cuttlefish. their seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal mixing meat from fish,"
1018,405-130895-0011.flac," concealed put in? yes, nedland went on. you can repay your debt by coming with me when i leave this infernal notalus."" ""'by the way,' concealed said. are we going in a favorable direction?'"
1019,405-130895-0013.flac," but if we returned to the pacific, far from every populated shore, what would happen to nedlands' plans? we would soon settle this important point, the nautilus traveled swiftly."
1020,405-130895-0007.flac," good lord, professor. ned land answered me. don't mention it. what did we do that so praiseworthy? not a thing. it was a question of simple arithmetic. your life is worth more than ours, so we had to save it."
1021,405-130895-0034.flac, didn't put in an appearance.
1022,405-130895-0010.flac," we're bound to each other forever, and i'm deeply indebted to you. which i'll take advantage of, the canadian shot back."
1023,405-130895-0006.flac," and gratitude to my two companions. ned and conceal had kept me alive during the final hours of our long death-throws, but no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion."
1024,405-130895-0024.flac," bullbearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens, with their smooth viscous filaments, they measured as much as 300 meters long, genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough."
1025,405-130895-0022.flac," a pyramid-shaped block of shale, with a very sharp summit, which, depending on whether it's clear or veiled in vapor, predicts fair weather or foul, as nedland told me. a first-class barometer, my friend."
1026,405-130894-0059.flac," picks rang out on that bed of ice. arms grew weary. hands were rubbed raw, but who cared about exhaustion? what difference were wounds? life's sustaining air reached our lungs. we could breathe. we could breathe."
1027,405-130894-0012.flac," after ned was dressed, i re-entered the lounge, whose windows had been uncovered, stationed next to conceal, i examined the stratus surrounding and supporting the nautilus. some moments later we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice."
1028,405-130894-0043.flac, but there are ten feet of water ahead or a stern of the nautilus all around us this freeze is gaining fast. how long i asked will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to breathe on board? a captain looked me straight in the eye.
1029,405-130894-0022.flac," after 12 hours had gone by, we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only 1 meter thick, hence about 600 cubic meters. assuming the same work would be accomplished every 12 hours,"
1030,405-130894-0019.flac," but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner. after two hours of energetic work, ned land re-entered, exhausted. he and his companions were replaced by new workmen, including conceal and me."
1031,405-130894-0027.flac," i know, he told me, in that calm tone, the most dreadful outlook couldn't change. it's one more danger, but i don't know any way of warding it off. our soul, chance of salvation,"
1032,405-130894-0062.flac," over the whole surface area only two meters were left to be removed. only two meters separated us from the open sea, but the ship's air tanks were nearly empty. the little air that remained had to be saved for the workmen. not an"
1033,405-130894-0051.flac, that was one degree gained.
1034,405-130894-0053.flac, the injections couldn't get it to go a single degree higher.
1035,405-130894-0035.flac," obviously, they would come together before the nautilus could break free. for an instant i was gripped by despair. my pick nearly slipped from my hands. what was the point of this digging if i was to die, smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone?"
1036,405-130894-0000.flac," xvi. shortage of air consequently, above, below, and around the notalless, there were impenetrable frozen walls. we were the ice-banks prisoners. the canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist."
1037,405-130894-0009.flac," my friends, i said. we are in a serious predicament, but i'm counting on your courage and energy."" sir, the canadian replied. this is no time to bore you with my complaints."
1038,405-130894-0065.flac," and he decided to crush this layer. the man had kept his energy and composure. he had subdued physical pain with moral strength. he could still think, plan, and act. at his orders, the craft was eased off."
1039,405-130894-0016.flac," 6,500 cubic meters, to dig a hole through which the ship could descend below this track device. work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity. instead of digging all around the notalless, which would have entailed even greater difficulties,"
1040,405-130894-0011.flac, which was promptly accepted. the canadian got into his underwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers.
1041,405-130894-0070.flac," i squeezed it in an involuntary convulsion. all at once carried away by its frightful excess load the notless sank into the waters like a cannonball, in other words, dropping as if in a vacuum."
1042,405-130894-0008.flac, hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks. the notalless slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters. the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lace emerged.
1043,405-130894-0036.flac, a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages. i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster. jaws irresistibly closing. supervising our work?
1044,405-130894-0075.flac," instead of breathing it themselves, they had saved it for me, and while they were suffocating, they poured life into me, dropped by drop. i tried to push the device away, they held my hands, and for a few moments i could breathe luxuriously."
1045,405-130894-0052.flac," after i monitored the operation's progress, double-checking it with many inspections, i told the captain, it's working. i think so, he answered me. we've escaped being crushed. now we have only asphyxiation to fear."
1046,405-130894-0017.flac," then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference. soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter, and huge chunks were loosened from its mass."
1047,405-130894-0061.flac," when his time was up, he yielded his equipment to another and re-entered the foul air on board, always calm, unflinching, and uncomplaining. that day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy."
1048,405-130894-0049.flac," in a few minutes the water reached 100 degrees centigrade. it was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process. the heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply going through the mechanism, water drawn cold from the sea arrived."
1049,405-130894-0002.flac," he said, in a calm voice, there are two ways of dying under the conditions in which we are placed. this inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor working out of problem for his pupils. the first way, he went on,"
1050,405-130894-0058.flac," to leave more air for master. it brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words. since conditions inside were universally unbearable,"
1051,405-130894-0030.flac," near evening one more meter had been dug from the trench. when i returned on board i was well-niased fixated by the carbon dioxide saturating the air. oh, if only we had the chemical methods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas."
1052,405-130894-0077.flac," had he perished, had his companions died with him."
1053,405-130894-0031.flac, there was no lack of oxygen. all this water contained a considerable amount.
1054,405-130894-0055.flac," the air couldn't be renewed in the notillus' interior. accordingly, that day it kept getting worse. an unbearable heaviness weighed me down. near three o'clock in the afternoon this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree."
1055,405-130894-0010.flac," he can use me any way he wants. he won't turn down your assistance. come along, ned."" i led the canadian to the room where the nautilus's men were putting on their diving suits. i informed the captain of ned's proposition."
1056,405-130894-0007.flac," i'm going to ground the notallist on the lower shelf, then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the thinnest of these ice-walls. can the panels in the lounge be left open? without ill-effect, we're no longer in motion."
1057,405-130894-0020.flac," the nautilus' chief officer supervised us. the water struck me as unusually cold, but i warmed up promptly while wielding my pick. my movements were quite free, although they were executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres."
1058,405-130894-0063.flac," atom for the nottless. when i returned on board, i felt half suffocated. what a night! i'm unable to depict it. such sufferings are indescribable. the next day i was short-winded."
1059,405-130894-0067.flac," the boat sank and was fitted into its socket. just then the whole crew returned on board, and the double outside door was closed. by this point the notallist was resting on a bed of ice only one meter thick."
1060,405-130894-0057.flac," nearly unconscious. my galant conceal felt the same symptoms, suffered the same sufferings, yet never left my side. he held my hand, he kept encouraging me, and i even heard him mutter."
1061,405-130894-0026.flac," there was no point in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous rescue work. but when i returned on board, i"
1062,405-130894-0047.flac," it's worth trying, i said, resolutely. so let's try it, professor."
1063,405-130894-0023.flac," before the nautilus could return to the surface of the waves, couldn't we all die of asphyxiation? were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice? it was a dreadful state of affairs, but we faced it head-on."
1064,405-130894-0015.flac," there we were separated from the sea by a 10 meter barrier. that's how thick the iceberg was. from this point on, it was an issue of cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the notless water line. this meant detaching about"
1065,405-130894-0048.flac," captain nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at work, supplying drinking water via evaporation. the mechanism was loaded with water, and the full electric heat of our batteries was thrown into coils of wash in liquid."
1066,405-130894-0037.flac," working himself, captain nemo passed near me just then. i touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our prison. the starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four meters from the noteless's hole."
1067,405-130894-0029.flac," the work kept me going. besides, working meant leaving the nautilus, which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks, and supplied by our equipment, which meant leaving the thin, foul air behind."
1068,405-130894-0064.flac, headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me real like a drunk. my companions were experiencing the same symptoms. some crewmen were at their last gasp.
1069,405-130894-0006.flac," well, then, captain, let's free ourselves within forty-eight hours. we'll try to at least, by cutting through one of these walls surrounding us. which one, i asked, borengs, will tell us that?"
1070,405-130894-0005.flac," but they'll supply air for only two days. now then, we've been buried beneath the waters for 36 hours, and the nautiluses heavy atmosphere already needs renewing. in another 48 hours, our reserve air will be used up."
1071,405-130894-0003.flac, is death by crushing. the second is death by asphyxiation. i don't mention the possibility of death by starvation because the notillist's provisions will certainly last longer than we will.
1072,405-130894-0054.flac," i was finally assured that there was no danger of its solidifying. by the next day, march 27, six metres of ice had been torn from the socket. only four metres were left to be removed. that still meant forty-eight hours of work."
1073,405-130894-0073.flac," my muscles had no power to contract. i am unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way, but i was aware that my death-throws had begun. i realized that i was about to die. suddenly i regained consciousness."
1074,405-130894-0013.flac," before digging into the ice, the captain had to obtain borings, to ensure working in the best direction. long boars were driven into the side walls, but after fifteen meters the instruments were still impeded by the thickness of those walls."
1075,405-130894-0041.flac," could come to our rescue? don't you see that by solidifying, it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us just as its freezing can burst the hardest stones? aren't you aware that this force could be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction?"
1076,405-130894-0042.flac," i know it, sir. so we can't rely on nature to rescue us. only our own efforts. we must counteract the solidification. we must hold it in check. and only are the side walls closing in."
1077,405-130894-0068.flac," we listened. we forgot our sufferings. we hoped once more we had staked our salvation on this one last gamble. despite the buzzing in my head, i soon could hear vibrations under the notillus' hull. we tilted."
1078,405-130894-0072.flac," brought to full speed the propeller made the sheet iron hole tremble down to its rivets, and we sped northward. but how long would it take to navigate under the ice-bank to the open sea? another day? i would be dead first."
1079,405-130894-0040.flac," if only my notalless were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed. well, i asked, not catching the captain's meaning, don't you understand, he went on, that the congealing of this water"
1080,405-130894-0078.flac, separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice. could we break through it?
1081,405-130894-0044.flac," it was now the twenty-sixth. we had lived off the ship-stores for five days. and all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen. even today, as i write these lines, my sensations are so intense."
1082,405-130894-0033.flac," and shake them continually. but this substance was missing on board, and nothing else could replace it."
1083,405-130894-0004.flac," therefore, let's concentrate on our chances of being crushed or asphyxiaated. as for asphyxiation, captain, i replied, that isn't a cause for alarm because the air tanks are full. true."
1084,405-130894-0050.flac," boiling hot at the body of the pump. the steaming water was injected into the icy water outside, and after three hours had passed,"
1085,405-130894-0076.flac, my eyes flew toward the clock. it was eleven in the morning. it had to be march 28. the nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of forty miles per hour. it was writhing in the waters.
1086,405-130894-0045.flac," that an involuntary terrace sweeps over me and my lungs still seem short of air. meanwhile,"
1087,405-130894-0071.flac," our full electric power was then put on the pumps, which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks. after a few minutes we had checked our fall. the pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement."
1088,405-130894-0039.flac," or will be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement. yes, i said, but what can we do?"" oh, he exclaimed."
1089,405-130894-0060.flac," and yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted him. his shift over, each man surrendered to a gasping companion, the air tank that would revive him."
1090,405-130894-0018.flac," these chunks weighed less than the water and by an unusual effect of specific gravity, each chunk took wing as it were to the roof of the tunnel."
1091,405-130894-0066.flac," in other words, it was raised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity. when it was afloat, the crew towed it, leading it right above the immense trench outline to match the ship's water line. next, the ballast tanks filled with water."
1092,405-130894-0021.flac," and the nautilus is atmosphere, which was already charged with carbon dioxide. the air hadn't been renewed in forty-eight hours, and its life-giving qualities were considerably weakened, meanwhile,"
1093,405-130894-0038.flac," the captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him. we returned on board. my diving suit removed i went with him to the lounge."" professor aranaxe he told me. this calls for heroic measures."
1094,405-130894-0032.flac," this life-giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us. i had thought it all out, but to no avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship. to absorb it, we would need to fill containers with potassium hydroxide."
1095,405-130894-0024.flac," each one of us determined to do his duty to the end. during the night, in line with my forecasts, a new one-meter slice was removed from this immense socket, but in the morning, wearing my diving suit,"
1096,405-130894-0056.flac," yons dislocated my jaws. my lungs were gasping in their quest for that end-kindling, elastic fluid required for breathing. now growing scarcer and scarcer. my mind was in a days. i lay outstretched, strength gone."
1097,405-130894-0074.flac," a few whiffs of air had entered my lungs. had we risen to the surface of the waves? had we cleared the ice-bank? no. ned and conceal, my two gallant friends, were sacrificing themselves to save me."
1098,405-130894-0001.flac, conceal kept still. i stared at the captain. his face had resumed its usual emotionallessness. he crossed his arms. he pondered. the notallist did not stir. the captain then broke into speech. gentlemen.
1099,405-130894-0014.flac, more than 400 meters high.
1100,405-130894-0046.flac," boiling water, i exclaimed. yes, sir. we are shut up in a relatively confined area. if the nautilus's pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space, wouldn't that raise its temperature and delay its freezing?"
1101,405-130894-0025.flac," when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other. the liquid strata farthest from the trench, not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools, were showing a tendency to solidify. in the face of this imminent new danger,"
1102,405-130894-0069.flac," the ice cracked with an odd ripping sound like paper tearing, and the notillus began settling downward. ""'we are going through,' concealed muttered in my ear. i couldn't answer him. i clutched his hand."
1103,405-130894-0034.flac," without this precaution, we wouldn't have awakened the following morning. the next day, march 26, i returned to my miner's trade, working to remove the fifth meter. the ice-banks, sidewalls, and underbelly had visibly thickened."
1104,405-130894-0028.flac," is to work faster than the water solidifies. we've got to get there first, that's all. get there first. by then i should have been used to this type of talk. for several hours that day i wielded my pick doggedly."
1105,4137-11701-0035.flac," oh, very well, if you're going to drop all your former friends, go on then. but when i'm married, there will always be a place for… understand, once, and for all,"" said udo engrily, that i am not getting married. no, don't take my arm."
1106,4137-11701-0036.flac," we can talk quite well like this. i am sorry, udo,"" said cornell meekley. we seem to have made a mistake, but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position. it wasn't in the least compromising."
1107,4137-11701-0002.flac," we will be her most humble obedient servants. she shall have everything she wants. including prince udo, smiled hyacinth. that's a splendid idea. we'll make her have udo."
1108,4137-11701-0017.flac, oh what a miracle worker true love is. i think one of the things which made belvain so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say.
1109,4137-11701-0016.flac, a different thing counters from when i last saw him.
1110,4137-11701-0018.flac," meanwhile, udo, of course, blundered along gaeli. we aren't exactly princess. i mean, what are you doing here, cornell? i didn't know princess that you..."
1111,4137-11701-0015.flac," udo is one of my oldest friends. he turned and clapped that bewildered highness on the back. aren't you udo? and i can think of no one more suitable in every way. he bowed again and turned back to the prince. well, udo, you're looking splendid."
1112,4137-11701-0019.flac," the countess and i were just having a little—i was just telling her what you said about. how did you get here, cornell?"" she'll we tell him? said cornell with a smile at hyacinth. hyacinth nodded."
1113,4137-11701-0039.flac," once more, i am not going to marry her. well, you must please yourself, but you have compromised her severely with that story. poor innocent girl. well, let's forget about it. and now tell me, how do you like eurelia?"
1114,4137-11701-0022.flac," more than an advisor, she guessed, to hyacinth, her own position would not be in much doubt. and as for the king, it might be months before he came back, and when he did come, would he remember her?"
1115,4137-11701-0045.flac," was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for— after all, he had been no more gallant than it was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman. it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions."
1116,4137-11701-0006.flac," prince cornell will be staying here,"" said the princess. prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both. and if they discuss those things in the servants' halls of those days,"
1117,4137-11701-0005.flac," be very close coronel, she whispered, and then they walked out together. if any of the servants of the palace were surprised to see coronel, they did not show it. after all, that was their business."
1118,4137-11701-0031.flac," and now, said the prince, tell me what you are doing here. cornell put his arm in uddles and walked him up and down the flagged path. you're approaching marriage."
1119,4137-11701-0013.flac," he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvain's face. she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him. why, whoever is this, she said, getting to her feet? before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon,"
1120,4137-11701-0007.flac," no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth, blessed her pretty face, had found her man at last."
1121,4137-11701-0028.flac," you know, of course, that his majesty comes back tomorrow with all his army. she did not swoon or utter a cry. she did not plead the vapors or the megrims."
1122,4137-11701-0046.flac," of course, he ought to have left eurelia long ago, but he had stayed on, and, well, decidedly, she was beautiful, perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that, and he had certainly neglected the princess a little."
1123,4137-11701-0014.flac," the princess and coronel were upon them. ah, countess, i thought we should find you together,"" said hyacinth archley. let me present to you my friend, the duke coronel."
1124,4137-11701-0042.flac, udo evidently hadn't thought of this. he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened. she couldn't do anything.
1125,4137-11701-0040.flac," said udo stiffly. well, perhaps you are right. i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way. udo, who was about to enter the palace, turned round with a startled look. what do you mean?"
1126,4137-11701-0050.flac," i must ask you not to refer to it. if i marry the countess, you'll be a very lucky man, put in coronel. i happen to know that the king of eurelia, however, she's chosen you, it seems."
1127,4137-11701-0038.flac," ah, and who would listen to a hopeless story like that?"
1128,4137-11701-0008.flac," but i get no assistance from roger at this point. he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders. i say,"" said coronel, as they went up the grand staircase. i am not a prince, you know. don't say i have deceived you."""
1129,4137-11701-0027.flac," there's no holding out at once he begins, volunteered quarno. he's the most desperate lover in arabic. my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth."
1130,4137-11701-0044.flac," udo dropped undecidedly into a seat. this wanted thinking out. the countess, what was wrong with her after all? and she evidently adored him. of course that was not surprising. the question was."
1131,4137-11701-0037.flac, protested udo indignantly.
1132,4137-11701-0020.flac," i rode,"" said coronel. it's a secret,"" he added."
1133,4137-11701-0024.flac," udo and i. here she squeezed the hand, and, finding it was coronels, took udo's boldly without any more maidenly nonsense. udo and i love each other. say something, udo."
1134,4137-11701-0021.flac," explained hyacinth. and hearing that there was to be a wedding, added coronel. bellevaine made up her mind. coronel was evidently a very different man from udo. if he stayed in eurelia as advisor,"
1135,4137-11701-0003.flac," it will annoy your father, but one can't please everybody. oh, i can see myself enjoying this."" they got up and wandered back along wiggs's path, and in hand. ""'i'm almost afraid to leave the forest,' said hyacinth."
1136,4137-11701-0047.flac," after all, again, why not marry the countess? it was absurd to suppose there was anything in cornel's nonsense, but one never knew, not that he was marrying her out of fear, no, certainly not. it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part."
1137,4137-11701-0001.flac," that's what makes it so jolly. we can do what we like, and it doesn't matter if it doesn't come off. so just for fun, let's think of something to pay her out. i feel i don't want to hurt anybody today. all right, we won't hurt her, we'll humor her."
1138,4137-11701-0030.flac," and with a curtsy she was gone. coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth. i'm enjoying this, he seemed to say. well, she announced. i must be going into. there'll be much to see about."
1139,4137-11701-0049.flac," i'm not in the least frightened by the countess. my dear udo, what a speech for a lover! of course you're not! after all, what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again."
1140,4137-11701-0033.flac, there hasn't been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now.
1141,4137-11701-0012.flac," and then, said udo, i jumped quickly to the right and whirling my—no, wait a bit, that was later—i jumped quickly to my left. yes, i remember it now. it was my left. i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my—"
1142,4137-11701-0011.flac," it was more than udo did. just now he was with her in her garden, telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with the dragon, apparently in its dotage, to which belvain was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator."
1143,4137-11701-0010.flac," father will make you a proper prince directly he comes back. will he? that's what i'm wondering. you see, he doesn't know yet about our little present to the countess. but it is quite time we got back to belvain. we have left her alone too long."
1144,4137-11701-0052.flac, cornell shook him solemnly by the hand. i congratulate your royal highness. i will announce your decision to the princess. she will be much delighted. and he turned into the palace.
1145,4137-11701-0029.flac," she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life. then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace. she said, if your royal highness will excuse me."
1146,4137-11701-0025.flac," prompted coronel. er, yes, said udo very unwillingly, and decided that he would explain it all afterwards. whatever his feelings for the countess, he was not going to be rushed into a marriage. oh, i'm so glad!"
1147,4137-11701-0051.flac," personally, i can't make out what she sees in you. what is it? i should have thought it was quite obvious,"" said udo with dignity. well, cornel, i think perhaps you are right, and that it's my duty to marry her."""
1148,4137-11701-0009.flac," ""'you are my prince,' said hyacinth proudly. ""'my dear, i am a king among men today, and you are my queen, but that's in our own special country of two.' ""'if you are so particular,' said hyacinth with a smile."
1149,4137-11701-0023.flac," we didn't want it to be known yet,"" she said giley, but you have guessed our secret, your royal highness. she looked modestly at the ground, and feeling for her reluctant lover's hand went on."
1150,4137-11701-0032.flac," he said, is the talk of arabic? naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was like. my dear udo, she's charming. i congratulate you. don't be a fool, coronel. i haven't the slightest intention of marrying her."
1151,4137-11701-0000.flac," and now, said coronel, we'd better decide what to do. but i don't mind what we do now,"" said hyacinth happily. she may have the throne and father and udo and—"
1152,4137-11701-0026.flac," said hyacinth. i felt somehow that it must be coming, because you've seen so much of each other lately. wigs and i have often talked about it together. what has happened to the child? thought bill vane. she isn't a child at all. she's grown up."
1153,4137-11701-0048.flac," the poor woman had misunderstood him, and she should not be disappointed. she seems fond of flowers,"" said coronel. you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you. now understand clearly coronel."
1154,4137-11701-0043.flac," yes, but of course the chance might come again. you have the thing hanging over you always. she's clever you know, and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy. lovely flowers, aren't they? what's the name of this one?"
1155,4137-11701-0034.flac," yes, i think you may take our word for it that it's true. i haven't the slightest intention. what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for?"
1156,4137-11701-0041.flac," you never told me. your precious countess whom you expect me to marry. how very unkind of her, a nasty person to annoy. he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully."
1157,4137-11701-0004.flac," in case something happens, what should happen? i don't know, but all our life together has been in the forest, and i'm just a little afraid of the world."
1158,4137-11702-0058.flac, what do you say to the princess elvira of trigong? i know his father had hopes in that direction. hyesin flipped round at coronel as if appealing for his support. he took a step towards her.
1159,4137-11702-0001.flac," so far as is known, this was her only work, but she built up some reputation on it, and bellevaine, who was a good judge, had a high opinion of her genius. to be exact, there were only 499 men."
1160,4137-11702-0025.flac, but she was still engrossed with the whiskers.
1161,4137-11702-0024.flac," by the way, he added, henry is marrying and settling down in barodia. it is curious, he went on, how after a war one's thoughts turn to matrimony. he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this."
1162,4137-11702-0028.flac, he told her of his secret journey to the king of brodie's tent. he told her of the king of brodie's letter.
1163,4137-11702-0029.flac, and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent.
1164,4137-11702-0049.flac," tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war, and how you pretended to be a swine herd, and how could any father have resisted in a little while, high asinth and core n l, or seated eagerly at his feet."
1165,4137-11702-0012.flac," down the steps came high a synth, all blue and gold, and flung herself into her father's arms. ""'my dear child,' said merwig as he patted her soothingly. ""'they're there. it's your old father. come back again. hrm. they're there.'"
1166,4137-11702-0008.flac, hyacinth would be growing up and getting married soon. life would be lonely in eurelia then. unless... should he risk it?
1167,4137-11702-0030.flac," to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings, and by and by the moment came of which kora nell had spoken. and now, said merowig,"
1168,4137-11702-0011.flac," or shall i stay here in the countess's garden, and amuse myself with udo? anyhow, i'll give you an hour alone together first."" the cavalcade drew up in front of the castle. hankertiffs fluttered to them from the walls. trumpets were blown, hounds bade."
1169,4137-11702-0031.flac," nothing much, i suppose? he waited nervously, wondering if hyacinth would realize that all was meant to include more particularly bellevaine. hyacinth drew a stool up to her father's chair and sat down very close to him."
1170,4137-11702-0033.flac," it's rather serious, but it's rather nice. father, dear, would you mind very much if i got married soon? my dear, you shall get married as soon as you like. let me see, there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day."
1171,4137-11702-0020.flac," said merrowake heartily, we shant have any trouble in that direction again, i fancy."" do tell me, did the king of barodia apologize? he did better than that. he abdicated. why?"
1172,4137-11702-0045.flac," he would say, these are matters for men to discuss. but hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell cornell the truth of the matter afterwards. it really looked as if cornell would have to be led into the secret too."
1173,4137-11702-0057.flac," he came to stay with you, and he never—his royal highness, put in coronel, has given his affections to another. uh-huh, so that's the secret. now i wonder if i can guess who she is."
1174,4137-11702-0059.flac," no, it's not the princess elvira,"" said hyacinth, a little nervously. the king laughed good-humouredly. oh, well, you must tell me,"" he said."
1175,4137-11702-0036.flac," let me see. there's that seven-headed bull. he's getting a little old now, but he was good enough for the last one. we might, ""'i don't want a suitor,' said hayes and the softly. i have one.' merrowig lent forward with eagerness."
1176,4137-11702-0009.flac," he must be longing to tell you that. oh, he'll have a hundred things to tell you first. but then, when he says, and what's been happening here while i've been away, nothing much, i suppose? then you can say."
1177,4137-11702-0026.flac, i can't plant them in the garden. i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia. isn't that a little unkind now that the poor man's dead? marrow wig looked round to him to see that there were no eavesdroppers.
1178,4137-11702-0055.flac," perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor, too."" hayesonth and coronel interchanged a smile. ""'a last father,' she said. his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms."""
1179,4137-11702-0040.flac," and who might coronel be? said the king rather sternly. he's—he's—well, he's—here he is, father. she ran up to him, and possibly as he came in at the door."
1180,4137-11702-0018.flac," there was another storm of cheers, the battle cry of eurelia. ho, ho, marrowig was shouted from five hundred throats, and the men dispersed happily to their homes. hiason then marrowig went into the palace."
1181,4137-11702-0060.flac," hyacinth put out her hand, and coronel pressed it encouragingly. ""'his royal highness prince udo,' she said."
1182,4137-11702-0004.flac," henry, having caught a glimpse of the chief armorer's daughter, had accepted without any false pride, and had frequently dropped in to suffer thereafter. now that the war was over, he found that he could not tear himself away."
1183,4137-11702-0010.flac," then i shall say, nothing much, only coronel, and such a clever. oh, i have my ideas,"" said coronel. well, i'll be out of the way somewhere. i think i'll go for a walk in the forest."
1184,4137-11702-0044.flac," he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure, an adventure after his own heart. merrowig was in an awkward position. he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room. leave us my child."
1185,4137-11702-0041.flac," oh, cornell, you're just in time. do tell father who you are."" cornell bowed profoundly to the king. before i explain myself, your majesty, he said,"
1186,4137-11702-0054.flac," that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia. there is only one man who could have got those. truly an excellent young man."" well, we'll arrange something, said marrowig, looking pleased."
1187,4137-11702-0015.flac," of our mothers and wives and daughters, prolonged cheering, as the case may be. hear here."
1188,4137-11702-0013.flac," he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down. my little hyacinth, my own little girl. oh, father, i am glad to have you back. there, there, my child."
1189,4137-11702-0016.flac," in honor of our great victory, i decree that from now onwards, tomorrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout eurelia. terrific cheering."
1190,4137-11702-0006.flac," were in his pocket, days of honored leisure were waiting for him. he gazed at each remembered landmark of his own beloved country, his heart overflowing with thankfulness. never again would he leave eurelia. how good to see highest in the game!"
1191,4137-11702-0043.flac, is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of brodie's own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him? there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it.
1192,4137-11702-0042.flac," may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the brodians? from the little i have gathered outside, it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred. but of course, i am longing to hear the full story from your majesty's own lips."
1193,4137-11702-0039.flac," by the way, who is he? he comes from arabic and his name is udo, of course. why didn't i think of him an excellent arrangement, my dear? it isn't udo, i'm afraid, father. it's kaurnaal."
1194,4137-11702-0005.flac," with king marrowig's permission, he was settling in barodia, and with the chief armorer's permission, he was starting on his new life as a married man. as the towers of the castle came in sight, marrowig drew a deep breath of happiness, home again."
1195,4137-11702-0047.flac, it happened like this. once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the king's letter to him. but your majesty cried coronal.
1196,4137-11702-0046.flac," there are certain state reasons,"" he said with dignity. why that story has been allowed to get about. part in your majesty, i have no wish to. but as you know so much, you may as well know all."
1197,4137-11702-0052.flac," that, said coronel simply, is much more surprising. marrowick, however, was not so sure of that. he liked the look of coronel. he liked his manner."
1198,4137-11702-0000.flac," a contemporary poet of the country. king marrowig, the first, rode back from war. as many other kings had done before, 500 men behind him were in sight. left right, left right, left right, left right, left right."
1199,4137-11702-0021.flac," well, said merrowig, remembering just in time, i...or killed him. oh, father, how rough of you! i don't think it hurt him very much, my dear."
1200,4137-11702-0048.flac," so you like it,"" said marrowig, trying to look modest. i love it. i knew he'd love it. put in high-assent. it's just the sort of story that cornel would love."
1201,4137-11702-0032.flac," ""'father,' she said, stroking his hand where it rested on his knee. ""'i have got some news for you.' ""'nothing about the count. nothing serious, i hope,' said merrowaigan alarm."
1202,4137-11702-0037.flac," my dear, this is indeed news. tell me all about it. upon what quest did you send him? highest senthed felt this coming."
1203,4137-11702-0053.flac," and he saw it once that he knew a good story when he heard one. of course, he said, you'll have to win her. anything your majesty sets me to do, it's as well, he added with a disarming smile."
1204,4137-11702-0022.flac," see, i have brought these home for you. he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper. oh, how exciting! whatever can it be? merwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers."
1205,4137-11702-0023.flac," neatly tied up with blue ribbon. father, he picked out the left one, fawns at orico, if he had known any latin, of the war and held it up for highest-sense inspection. there you can see the place where henry small knows as arrow bent it."
1206,4137-11702-0007.flac," poor little hyacinth left all alone, but there she had had the count as bellevaine, a woman of great experience to help her. bellevaine. should he risk it? how much did she thought of him while he was away?"
1207,4137-11702-0038.flac," what is his income? a man must prove his worth in some way. i haven't sent him away at all yet,"" she said. he's only just come. he's been very kind to me, and i'm sure you'll love him. well, well, we'll arrange something for him."
1208,4137-11702-0017.flac," here he turned and embraced his daughter again, and if his eye traveled over her shoulder in the direction of belvain's garden, it is a small matter, and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame."
1209,4137-11702-0002.flac," henry smallnose, a bowman of considerable promise, had been left behind in the enemy's country, the one casualty of war. while spying out the land in the early days of the invasion,"
1210,4137-11702-0050.flac," and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures. well, well,"" said the king at the end of it, when he had received their tribute of admiration. those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in wartime. he turned to coronel."
1211,4137-11702-0027.flac," can you keep a secret?"" he asked mysteriously. ""'of course,' said hyacinth, deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told koranel. well, then listen."""
1212,4137-11702-0019.flac," now, father,"" said hyacinth later on, when merrowig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself. you've got to tell me all about it. i can hardly believe it's really over. yes, yes, it's all over."
1213,4137-11702-0014.flac," he took a step forward and addressed his troops. men of eurelia, tears, we have returned from a long and arduous conflict. tears, to the embraces, loud tears,"
1214,4137-11702-0035.flac," no matter dear, we can easily find you plenty more suitors. indeed, the subject has been very near my thoughts lately. we'll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighboring countries. there'll be no lack of candidates."
1215,4137-11702-0003.flac," he had been discovered by the chief armorer of barodia at full length on the wet grass searching for tracks. the chief armorer, a kindly man,"
1216,4137-11702-0034.flac," i sent them off an adventures of some kind, but dear me, yes, they ought to have been back by now. i suppose you haven't heard anything of them?"" ""'no father,' said hyacinth with a little smile. ""'ah, well, no doubt they were unsuccessful.'"
1217,4137-11702-0056.flac," wait till he has seen them, my dear,"" said merrowig with the chuckle. he has seen them, father. what? you invited him here?"
1218,4137-11702-0051.flac," and so you, i understand, wish to marry my daughter? does that surprise your majesty? well, no, it doesn't. and she, i understand, wishes to marry you. yes, please, father."
1219,8419-286676-0007.flac," the atters were always away. people said that the atters were afraid of them. the yellow brown frog wished that the atters could be scared, badly scared sometime, so scared that a chilly feeling would run down their backs from their heads clear to the tips of their tails."
1220,8419-286676-0004.flac," that was bellistoma's way. he would sting people who bothered him, but then he always said that they need not have bothered him, and perhaps that was so. with the water atters it was different. they were good-natured enough."
1221,8419-286676-0006.flac," they had such ugly mouths and such quick motions. the larger fishes kept away on account of their children, who were small and tender. one might think that the santo cranes, the fish hawks, and the other shore families would have been good friends for them, but when they called,"
1222,8419-286676-0026.flac," ouch! ouch! what does the matter? ask the mud turtle. then he began to slap the water with his shorts out tail and say, ouch!"
1223,8419-286676-0022.flac," i think the ducks spoil their children,"" said she. they make such a fuss over them, and they are not nearly so bright as my children. why, mine hatch as soon as the eggs are laid, and go hunting at once. they are no trouble at all."
1224,8419-286676-0013.flac," it is useful in feeling of things,"" she said, and then, i have always thought it quite becoming. she could see herself reflected in the still water below her, and she noticed how prettily the dark brown of her back shaded into the white of her belly."
1225,8419-286676-0018.flac," they do not always take so many home as they brought. the snapping turtle became very much interested in his warty right foreleg, and did not seem to hear what she said. the mud turtle smiled. i have heard she went on."
1226,8419-286676-0012.flac," with her tail twisted carelessly around a willow branch. the snapping turtle and a mud turtle father were in the shallow water below her. her slender, forced tongue was starting in and out of her open mouth."
1227,8419-286676-0009.flac," but people said that one of the atters had frightened the yellow-brown frog so that he never got over it, and this was the reason he felt so. the water atters were certainly the cleverest people in the pond."
1228,8419-286676-0024.flac," most of them remarked the turtles. all of them, she said, except us atters and the turtles. i even think that some of the turtles are a little queer, don't you? we have thought so. said the mud turtle."
1229,8419-286676-0002.flac," and that he had a bad habit of using his stout sucking tube to sting with. still, billah stomach did not care. he said, a giant water bug does not always live in the water. i shall have my wings soon, and leave the water and marry."""
1230,8419-286676-0033.flac," but then, you know, we are not stupid. of course not. reply the mud turtle."
1231,8419-286676-0030.flac," as the water adder in her sweetest voice, nothing is easier. and she wound herself around the willow branch in another graceful position, and took the tip of her tail daintyly between her teeth. huff! said the snapping turtle."
1232,8419-286676-0025.flac," they certainly are, agreed to snapping turtle, who was beginning to feel much better natured. who what did you say? as the adder who, like all her family, was a little deaf. ouch! explained the snapping turtle."
1233,8419-286676-0031.flac, and he pulled his tail out of the mud and swam away.
1234,8419-286676-0028.flac," and he backed into the mud, knowing that fine soft mud is the best thing in the world for stings."
1235,8419-286676-0014.flac," you see she was vain as well as clever. the snapping turtle felt crossed today, and had come to see if a talk with her would not make him feel better. the mud turtle was tired of having the children sprawl around him."
1236,8419-286676-0000.flac, the clever water adder none of the pond people were alone more than the water-adders. the snapping turtle was left to himself a great deal until the day when he and bellistoma drove away the boys. after that...
1237,8419-286676-0001.flac," his neighbors began to understand him better and he was less grumpy, so that those who wore shells were soon quite fond of him. belestoma did not have many friends among the smaller people, and only a few among the larger ones. they said that he was cruel."
1238,8419-286676-0020.flac," as the snapping turtle, and he was snappy about it. oh, nothing! replyed the water-atter, swinging her head back and forth and looking at the scales on her body. i know what you mean, so the snapping turtle."
1239,8419-286676-0010.flac," she could do almost anything and she knew it. she talked about it too, and that showed bad taste, and was one reason why she was not liked better. she could swim very fast, could creep, glide."
1240,8419-286676-0023.flac," i never worry about mine,"" said the mud turtle. although their mother thinks it is not safe for them all to sleep at once as they do want to log in the sunshine. ""'it isn't,' said the adder decidedly. i never close my eyes.'"
1241,8419-286676-0019.flac," that when young ducks stave head first, they are quite sure to come up again, but that when they dive feet first, they never come up."
1242,8419-286676-0016.flac," and fly around in the sunshine to find food for their children. ah, yes, said the mud turtle. how they must wish for shells. humph! said the snapping turtle. what for? to fly with?"
1243,8419-286676-0032.flac," said the mud turtle, and he swam away with the snapping turtle. ""'what a rude person she is,' they said. ""'always trying to show how much more clever she is than other people. we would rather be stupid and polite.' after a while the snapping turtle said."
1244,8419-286676-0027.flac," toon naughty young waterboatmen had swung quietly up on their backs and stung the turtles on their tails. then they swam away, pushing themselves quickly through the water with swift strokes of their hairy or legs."
1245,8419-286676-0015.flac," and of mrs. mud turtle telling about the trouble she had to get the right kind of food. the clever water-adder spoke first of the weather. ""'it must be dreadfully hot for the sure people,' she said."
1246,8419-286676-0005.flac," yet the mud turtles and snapping turtle were the only ones who ever called upon them and found them at home. the small people without shells were afraid of them, and the clams and ponds nails never called upon anyone. the minos said they could not bear the looks of the atters."
1247,8419-286676-0011.flac," catch hold of things with her tail, hang herself from the branch of a tree, lift her head far into the air, leap, dart, bound, and dive. all her family could do these things, but she could do them a little the best. one day she was hanging over the pond in a very graceful position."
1248,8419-286676-0003.flac," after that, i shall fly away on my wedding trip. mrs. belastoma may go with me, if she feels like doing so after laying her eggs here. i shall go anyway, and i shall flutter and sprawl around the light, and sting people who bother me, and have a happy time."
1249,8419-286676-0021.flac," and you know what you mean, but i have to eat something. and if i am swimming under the water and a duckling paddles along just above me and sticks his foot into my mouth, i am likely to swallow him before i think."" the water at her saw that he was provoked by what she had said, so she talked about something else."
1250,8419-286676-0008.flac," i wish,"" said he, that the chili-feeling would be big enough to go way through to their bellies. their bellies are only the front side of their backs anyway,"" he added, because they are so thin. of course this was a dreadful wish to make."
1251,8419-286676-0017.flac," let them come in swimming with their children if they are warm and tired. the water at her left in her snakey way and showed her sharp teeth. i have heard, she said, that when the wild ducks spring their children here to swim."
1252,8419-286676-0029.flac," if i could only reach my tail with my head, or even with one of my hind feet."
1253,8419-286667-0016.flac," then they stood and fished for a long time without saying anything. when she flew away, she said, that is a very pleasant fishing-place. he stood on the other leg for a while, and thought how sweet her voice sounded as she said it."
1254,8419-286667-0020.flac," if he had been an older crane and understood the ways of the world a little better, he would have known that she meant, aren't you coming to that fishing place? i am going now!"
1255,8419-286667-0007.flac," while they trumpeted or called out, goodbye, stop forcing the fall. the flying cranes trumpeted back. we will. don't forget us. that night they slept near together, as they had done one with the large flock."
1256,8419-286667-0003.flac," as they came near the pond, they flew lower and lower, until all swept down to the earth and elided, tall and stately, by the edge of the water. they had eaten nothing for several days, and were soon hunting for food, some on land."
1257,8419-286667-0021.flac," still, although he was such a young crane and had never danced until this year, he began to think that she liked him and enjoyed having him near. so he flew off to the fishing place where he had seen her the day before, and he stalked along to where she was."
1258,8419-286667-0001.flac," or if they had been flying by night as they usually did, they would have stayed near the ground, and their leader would have trumpeted loudly to let his followers know which way he was going. they would also have trumpeted, but more softly, to tell him that they were coming after."
1259,8419-286667-0029.flac," it is a lovely place, but i could never have a nest alone."" ""'let me help you,' he said. ""'i want to marry and have a home.'"" ""'why,' said she, as she premed her feathers. that is very good plan.'"
1260,8419-286667-0025.flac," and she said she couldn't remember, that she never could remember what she had forgotten. it made him feel very badly to have her leave him so. he wanted a chance to tell her something yet, whenever he tried to, it seemed to stick in his bill. he began to fear that she didn't like him."
1261,8419-286667-0019.flac," as she stalked off toward the pond she passed him, and she said over her shoulder, i should think you would be hungry. i am almost starved. after she had gone, he wondered why she had said that."
1262,8419-286667-0018.flac," he bowed to her often or then to any of the rest, and he thought she noticed it. they danced until they were almost too tired to move."
1263,8419-286667-0010.flac," a fine young fellow began to strut up and down before the rest, bowing low and leaping high into the air, and every now and then whooping as loudly as he could. the goals who had spent the winter by the pond screamed to each other, the crane dance has begun!"
1264,8419-286667-0004.flac," and some in the water, for they had stopped to feed and rest. those who hunted in the water did so very quietly. a crane would stand on one leg with his head against his breast, so quietly that one might think him asleep. but as soon as anything eatable came near,"
1265,8419-286667-0011.flac," even the frogs who were afraid of cranes crept quietly near to look on. it was not long before another young crane began to skip and hop and circle around, drooping his wings and whooping as he went."
1266,8419-286667-0002.flac," they were a fine company to look upon, orderly, strong and dignified. their long necks were stretched out straight ahead, their long legs straight behind, and they beat the air with slow regular strokes of the strong wings."
1267,8419-286667-0000.flac," the dance of the sandhill cranes. one fine day in spring, a great flock of sandhill cranes came from the south. they were flying high and quietly because the weather was bright. if it had been stormy."
1268,8419-286667-0023.flac," for all the eight cranes had danced together, but he thought it very wonderful. did you notice to whom i bowed? he asked. he was so excited that his knees shook, and he had to stand on both legs at once to keep from falling."
1269,8419-286667-0006.flac," they were those who thought of staying there for the summer. when the flock arose to fly on again, eight cranes stayed behind. they watched their friends fly away and stood on the ground with their necks and bills uplifted and mouths open."
1270,8419-286667-0008.flac," and one crane kept awake to watch for danger while the others tucked their heads under their wings. they were fine-looking even when they slept, and some people never looked well unless they are awake. they were brownish grey, with no bright markings at all."
1271,8419-286667-0026.flac," and the next time the crane's dance he didn't bow to her so much, but he strutted and leaped and wept even more, and she strutted and leaped and wept almost as loudly as he. when they were all tired out and had stopped dancing, she said to him, i am so tired!"
1272,8419-286667-0028.flac," and was afraid she might marry him if he was not quick. now he pointed with one wing to this nesting place and said, how would you like to build a nest there?"" she looked to where he had pointed. i, she said. why?"
1273,8419-286667-0012.flac," every crane danced, brothers and sisters and all, and as they did so, they looked lovingly at each other, and admired the fine steps and enjoyed the woping. this went on until they were so tired they could hardly stand, and had to stop to eat and rest."
1274,8419-286667-0009.flac," and their long legs gave them a very gentile look. the tops of their heads were covered with warty red skin, from which grew short black feathers that looked more like hairs. one morning when the cranes awakened."
1275,8419-286667-0030.flac," when did you think of it? so they were married, and mrs. sandhill crane often told her friends afterward that mr. crane was so much in love with her that she just had to marry him. they were very, very happy, and after a while,"
1276,8419-286667-0014.flac," she stood with her head on her breast and looked at the water. after a while he trumpeted softly, as though he were just trying his voice. then she gave a pretty little start and said, oh, are you here? how you did frighten me!"
1277,8419-286667-0005.flac," he would bend his body, stretch out his neck, open his long slender bill, and swallow it at one gulp. then he would seem to fall asleep again. while most of the cranes were still feeding, some of them were stalking through the woods and looking this way in that."
1278,8419-286667-0013.flac," when they were eating, the young fellow who had begun the dance stalked up to the sister of one of his friends as she stood in the edge of the pond, gracefully balanced on one leg. she did not turn her head towards him, although having such a long and slender neck, she"
1279,8419-286667-0027.flac," let us go off into the woods and rest. you may be very sure he was glad to go, and as he stalked off with her, he led the way to a charming nesting place. he didn't know just how to tell what he wanted to, but he had seen another crane bowing to her."
1280,8419-286667-0022.flac," he pityed short-necked people. then he said, poo! i can take bigger mouthfuls than that. you ought to see what big mouthfuls i can take."" she changed and stood on her other leg. i saw you dancing this morning. she said."
1281,8419-286667-0015.flac," i am sorry,"" he said. i did not want to frighten you, and he looked at her admiringly. he was just for a minute, she answered."
1282,8419-286667-0024.flac," when a crane is as much excited as that, it is pretty serious. to my sister, she asked carelessly as she drew one of her long tail feathers through her beak. no, said he. i bowed to her sister."
1283,8419-286667-0017.flac," then he thought that, if she liked the place so well, she might come there again the next day. he wondered why he could not come too, although everybody knows that a crane catches more if he fishes alone. the next morning when the crane's danced."
1284,8419-293473-0005.flac," do you ever fix a place for your eggs?"" ""'a place?' said the brown walking stick, waving her long and slender feelers to and fro. ""'a place?' ""'oh no, i think they will hatch where they are. it is too much trouble to find a place.'"
1285,8419-293473-0004.flac," they said it was not gentile to hurry, no matter what happened. one day the tree frog was under the tree when the large brown walking stick decided to lay some eggs. he saw her dropping them carelessly around on the ground and asked,"
1286,8419-293473-0013.flac," their feelers were held quite close together, and they did not move their feet at all, only swayed their bodies gracefully from side to side. now they were on the ground, hunting through the flat piles of cut grass for some fresh and juicy bits to eat."
1287,8419-293473-0014.flac," the ants were scrambling around as busy as ever, and life went on quite as though neither men nor horses had ever entered the meadow. see? crytaspiter, who was busily looking after her web, there comes a horse drawing something in the farmer sitting on it and driving."
1288,8419-293473-0001.flac," perhaps they were not happy with their relatives. but then, if one is a walking stick, you know, one does not care so very much about one's family. these walking sticks had grown up the best way they could, with no father or mother to care for them."
1289,8419-293473-0002.flac," they had never been taught to do anything useful, or to think much about other people. when they were hungry, they ate some leaves, and never thought what they should eat the next time that they happened to be hungry. when they were tired, they went to sleep."
1290,8419-293473-0020.flac," the walking sticks looked very uncomfortable, and the brother and sister could not think of anything to say. it was the young green one who spoke at last."
1291,8419-293473-0000.flac," the dignified walking sticks. three walking sticks from the forest had come to live in the big maple tree near the middle of the meadow. nobody knew exactly why they had left the forest, where all their sisters and cousins and aunts lived."
1292,8419-293473-0018.flac," perhaps they can't help being fat, but they might at least act gentile. what is it to be gentile?"" asked a grasshopper suddenly. he had heard every word that the walking stick said. why? said the five-legged walking stick."
1293,8419-293473-0019.flac," it is just to be gentile. to act as you see us act, and to—just here the hate-tetter passed over them, and every one of the walking sticks was sent flying through the air and landed on his back."
1294,8419-293473-0006.flac," some others do not think it too much trouble to be careful where they lay eggs. that may be,"" said the brown walking stick. but they do not belong to our family. she spoke as if those who did not belong to her family might be good but could never be gentile."
1295,8419-293473-0015.flac," when the horse was well into the meadow, the former moved to bar, and the queer-looking machine began to kick the grass this way in that, with its many stiff and shining legs. a frisky young grasshopper kicked in the same way, and happened, just happened, of course."
1296,8419-293473-0016.flac," then there was a great scrambling and the crickets froliced with them. the young walking stick thought it looked like great fun and almost wished herself some other kind of insect so that she could tumble around in the same way. she did not quite wish it, you understand."
1297,8419-293473-0017.flac," and would never have thought of it if she had turned brown. ah! said the five-legged walking-stick. what's scrambling? how very common. yes indeed, said his sister. why can't they learn to move slowly and gracefully?"
1298,8419-293473-0008.flac," the same long feelers, and the same sort of long slender legs. if you had passed them in a hayfield, you would surely have thought each a stem of hay, unless you happened to see them move. the other walking stick, their friend, was younger and green."
1299,8419-293473-0010.flac," that was because he crawled into a clump of ferns and kept very still. his sister came and looked at him and said, now, if you were only a spider, it would not be long before you would have six legs again."
1300,8419-293473-0011.flac," of course, you know, spiders never do have a hundred, and the walking stick wouldn't be walking without any. but that was just his way of speaking, and it showed what kind of insect he was. his relatives all waved their feelers one at a time and said,"
1301,8419-293473-0007.flac, she had once told her brother the five-legged walking stick that she would not want to live if she could not be gentile. she thought the meadow people very common. the five-legged walking stick looked much like his sister. he had the same long slender body.
1302,8419-293473-0009.flac," he knew just what to expect, so when the nut hatch set him down on the bark to look at him, he unhooked his feet from the bark and tumbled to the ground. the nut hatch tried to catch him and broke off one of his legs, but she never found him again, although she looked and looked and looked."
1303,8419-293473-0003.flac," and when they had slept enough, they awakened. they had nothing to do but to eat and sleep, and they did not often take the trouble to think. they felt that they were a little better than those meadow people who rushed and scrambled and worked from morning until night, and they showed very plainly how they felt."
1304,8419-293473-0012.flac," ah, he has the true walking stick spirit. then they paid no more attention to him, and after a while he and his sister and their green little friend left the forest for the meadow. on the day when the grass was cut, they had sat quietly in their trees and looked gentile."
1305,8419-293469-0007.flac," oh, how happy we were then. i remember the day when my hind legs began to grow, and how the other tadpoles crowded around me in the water and swam close to me to feel the two little bunches that were to be legs."
1306,8419-293469-0017.flac," she picked me up and carried me inside. oh, how frightened i was. my heart thumped as though it would burst, and i tried my best to get away from her. she didn't hurt me at all, but she would not let me go."
1307,8419-293469-0004.flac," one day, when many of the meadow people were gathered around him, he told them his story. when i was a little fellow, he said, i was strong and well, and could leap farther than any other frog of my size."
1308,8419-293469-0019.flac," wonderful indeed! and at the top continued the tree-frog, was something white over the doorway into my prison. in the bottom were water and a stone, and from the bottom to the top was a ladder."
1309,8419-293469-0024.flac," but for a long time i could not sleep without dreaming that i was back in prison, and i would croak in my sleep at the thought of it. i heard you, cried the katie did, and i wondered what was the matter. matter enough, said the tree frog."
1310,8419-293469-0021.flac," in the pleasant weather, of course, i went to the top of the ladder, and when it was going to rain i would go down again. every time that i went up or down, those dreadful creatures would put their faces up close to my prison."
1311,8419-293469-0002.flac," none of his friends had known him then, but he was an honest fellow, and they were sure that everything he told was true. besides, they must be true, for how could a body ever think out such remarkable tales from his own head?"
1312,8419-293469-0020.flac," i had enough to eat, but anybody who has been free cannot be happy shut in. i watched my chance, and three times i got out when the little door was not quite closed. twice i was caught and put back."
1313,8419-293469-0023.flac," after they stopped hunting, the wind blew the door open and i hopped out. you don't say, exclaimed a grasshopper."
1314,8419-293469-0008.flac," my forelegs did not grow until later, and these bunches came just in front of my tail. your tail? cried up huzzled young cricket."
1315,8419-293469-0018.flac," she put me in a very queer prison. at first when she put me down on a stone in some water, i did not know that i was in prison. i tried to hop away and bump when my head against something."
1316,8419-293469-0014.flac," the clearest thing about it was that the smaller creatures seemed to make the larger ones do whatever they wanted them to. they even made some of them help do their work. you may not believe me, but what i tell you is true."
1317,8419-293469-0003.flac," when he first came to his home by the elm tree, he was very thin and looked as though he had been sick. the katie did's who stayed near said that he croaked in his sleep, and that, you know, is not what well and happy frog should do."
1318,8419-293469-0000.flac," in all the meadow there was nobody who could tell such interesting stories as the old tree frog. even the garter snake, who had been there the longest, and the old cricket who had lived in the farm yard, could tell no such exciting tales as the tree frog."
1319,8419-293469-0010.flac," the knobs on the ends of my toes were sticky so that i could climb a tree. and then i was ready to start on my travels. some of the other frogs started with me, but they stopped along the way, and at last i was alone."
1320,8419-293469-0013.flac," the largest creatures had four legs, and some of them had horns. the smaller creatures had only two legs on which to walk, and two other limbs of some sword with which they lifted and carried things."
1321,8419-293469-0009.flac," i did have when i was a tadpole,"" said the tree-frog. i had a beautiful wiggly little tail with which to swim through the waters of the pond, but as my legs grew larger and stronger, my tail grew little-learn weaker, until there wasn't any tail left."
1322,8419-293469-0015.flac," as you may guess, i stayed there a long time watching these strange creatures work."
1323,8419-293469-0001.flac, all the wonderful things of which he told had happened before he came to the meadow.
1324,8419-293469-0022.flac, and i could hear a roaring sound which meant they were talking and laughing. the last time i got out.
1325,8419-293469-0025.flac," it makes my skin dry to think of it now. and friends, the best way i can ever repay your kindness to me is to tell you to never, never, never, never go near the farmhouse. and they all answered"
1326,8419-293469-0011.flac," that was a bold young fellow. and when i saw a great white thing among the trees up yonder, i made up my mind to see what it was. there was a great red thing in the yard beside it, but i liked the white one better."
1327,8419-293469-0016.flac," there were some bright colored flowers near the house, and i crawled in among them. there i rested until sunset, and then began my evening song. while i was singing, one of the people from the house came out and found me."
1328,8419-293469-0005.flac," i was hatched in the pond beyond the farmhouse, and ate my way from the egg to the water outside like any other frog. perhaps i ought to say, like any other tadpole. for of course i began life as a tadpole."
1329,8419-293469-0012.flac," i hopped along as fast as i could, for i did not then know enough to be afraid. i got close up to them both and saw strange big creatures going in and out of the red thing. the barn, as i afterward found it, was called."
1330,8419-293469-0006.flac," i played an eight with my brothers and sisters, and little dreamed what trouble was in store for me when i grew up. we were all in a hurry to be frogs."
1331,3699-19402-0011.flac," it became a violation of nature, and was so far, you see, criminal. it is for this reason and please your references, that keyholes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes."
1332,3699-19402-0007.flac," which, having little or no meaning in them, nature is oftentimes obliged to find one. and as for my father's example, to a so far from being either aiding or a betting baron to,"
1333,3699-19402-0003.flac," whether it was a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession. my father, who was all sensibilities from head to foot,"
1334,3699-19402-0022.flac," but not vaporingly, and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement, bid his honor never fear. now my uncle toby did fear, and grievously too."
1335,3699-19402-0000.flac," could have vented such an insinuation. he was, however, frank and generous in his nature, and at all times open to conviction, so that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort."
1336,3699-19402-0016.flac," in a period of 15 or 16 years since they had been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle toby's life, for he seldom went further than the bowling green."
1337,3699-19402-0004.flac," conscience redoubled her blow. he turned his face suddenly the other way, and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards by a cross-movement of her right leg."
1338,3699-19402-0005.flac," a thin blue chill, perlucid crystal with all its humors so at rest, the least moat or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of it had it existed."
1339,3699-19402-0019.flac," a whiff of military pride had puffed out his shirt at the wrist, and upon that, in a black leather thong, clipped into a tassel beyond the knot, hung the corporal's stick. my uncle toby carried his cane."
1340,3699-19402-0015.flac," and nature had moreover wrote gentlemen, with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance, that even his tarnished gold-lazed hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him."
1341,3699-19402-0012.flac," though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle toby's great romali wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it. it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk."
1342,3699-19402-0010.flac," for certainly, keyholes were made for other purposes, and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a keyhole to be what it was,"
1343,3699-19402-0030.flac, a thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have said more for salibacy. my uncle toby looked earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling green.
1344,3699-19402-0020.flac," like a pike. it looks swell at least, quote, my father to himself."
1345,3699-19402-0028.flac," when once a poor creature is in, he is in and please your honor forever."" ""'tis very true,' said my uncle toby, looking gravely at mrs. wadman's house as he spoke. nothing"
1346,3699-19402-0026.flac," your honor replied the corporal, no's of tom's misfortunes, but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this."
1347,3699-19402-0029.flac," said by uncle toby, musing. whilst a man is free, cried the corporal, giving a flourish with his stick thus."
1348,3699-19402-0024.flac," and yet, accepting once that he was beguiled into it by mrs. wadman, he had never looked steadfastly into one, and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart."
1349,3699-19402-0001.flac," when his conscience smote him. my mother was then conjugal swinging with her left arm twisted under his right, in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his."
1350,3699-19402-0021.flac," my uncle toby turned his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal, and the corporal, as often as he did it, gave a slight flourish with his stick."
1351,3699-19402-0018.flac," and with his hair tucked up under his monteiro cap, which he had furbished up for the occasion."
1352,3699-19402-0025.flac," she cannot, quote my uncle toby halting when they had marched up to within twenty paces of mrs. wadman's door. she cannot corporal take it a miss."
1353,3699-19402-0023.flac," infinite was his pity. nor would the most courteous night of romance have gone further, at least upon one leg, to have wiped away a tear from a woman's eye."
1354,3699-19402-0013.flac," to have cost her leadership a smile. it curled everywhere but where the corporal would have it, and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it on her, he could as soon have raised the dead."
1355,3699-19402-0008.flac," that was the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head. nature had done her part to have spared him this trouble, and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it."
1356,3699-19402-0017.flac," and, to shorten all description, they shone so bright against the sun that morning, and had so metallic and dirty in air with them, that had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armor nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination."
1357,3699-19402-0027.flac," that if tom had not married the widow, or had its pleased god after their marriage, that they had but put pork into their sausages, the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed, and dragged to the inquisition."
1358,3699-19402-0009.flac," and here am i sitting this 12th day of august 1766, in a purple-jurkin and a yellow pair of slippers, without either wig or cap on, a most tragic comical completion of his prediction."
1359,3699-19402-0006.flac," my mother, madame, was so at no time, either by nature, by institution or example. a temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of the year."
1360,3699-19402-0002.flac," she raised her fingers and let them fall. it could scarce be called a tap, or if it was a tap,"
1361,3699-19402-0014.flac," such it was, or rather, such would it have seemed upon any other brow, but the sweet look of goodness, which sat upon my uncle toby's, assimilated everything around it so sovereignly to itself."
1362,3699-175950-0000.flac," steph cried my great-grandfather, clapping his hand upon his nose."
1363,3699-175950-0016.flac," brother didius, trebonius will answer. now, trebonius, the civilian and church lawyers beard, being three inches and a half and three eighths longer than didius his beard,"
1364,3699-175950-0001.flac," now, my great grandfather's nose was for all the world, like unto the noses of all the men, women, and children, whom pentegruel found dwelling upon the island of enison."
1365,3699-175950-0022.flac," but that was not thy transgression, my dear uncle. here, but why here, rather than in any other part of my story, i am not able to tell, but here it is. my heart stops me."
1366,3699-175950-0024.flac," devoured, no man's bread. gently, with faithful trim behind thee, didst thou amble round the little circle of thy pleasures, jostling no creature in thy way. for each one's sorrows thou hast a tear."
1367,3699-175950-0023.flac," whilst i am pouring forth the warmest sentiment of love for thee and veneration for the excellency of thy character, that ever virtue and nature kindled in a nephews bosom."
1368,3699-175950-0007.flac," and feel pity for the force of education and the prevalence of opinions long-derived from ancestors. for three generations at least, this tenet in favor of long-noses"
1369,3699-175950-0002.flac," by the way, if you would know the strange way of getting a kin amongst so flat-nosed people, you must read the book, find it out yourself you never can."
1370,3699-175950-0015.flac," or when he chewed it, or when he roasted it, or when he peeled, or when he brought it home, or when he digested, or when he—forged his plain-sour—if the first picking up of the apple made it not his, that no subsequent act could."
1371,3699-175950-0012.flac," did he read such books and observe such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him change sides? now my father, as i told you last year, detested all this. he picked up an opinion, sir."
1372,3699-175950-0005.flac," as soon as ever he entered upon the odd fifty, he generally gave aloud him."
1373,3699-175950-0004.flac," so that my father had the jointure to pay, 150 pounds half yearly on mikkelmuss and lady day, during all that time. no man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father,"
1374,3699-175950-0017.flac, that the sweat of a man's brows and the exudations of a man's brains are as much a man's own property as the breaches upon his backside.
1375,3699-175950-0025.flac," for each man's need thou hast a shilling. whilst i am worth one to pay a weeder, thy path from thy door to thy bowling green shall never be grown up."
1376,3699-175950-0006.flac," inserted his hand cautiously, betwixt his head and the call of his wig, looked at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it, and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples."
1377,3699-175950-0020.flac," by the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is incredible, and i am quite lost in my understanding, when i am considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon worse subjects."
1378,3699-175950-0009.flac," that he did not conceive how the greatest family in england could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses. and, for the contrary reason, he would generally add,"
1379,3699-175950-0021.flac," what was to be had, however, he set the greater store by. and though my father would often sport with my uncle toby's library, which by the by was ridiculous enough,"
1380,3699-175950-0011.flac," i mean the external organ of smelling, or that part of man which stands prominent in his face, and which painters say, in good jolly noses and well-proportient faces, should comprehend a full third, that is, measured downwards from the setting-on of the hair."
1381,3699-175950-0010.flac," that it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long and jolly noses, following one another in a direct line,"
1382,3699-175950-0019.flac," would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on, and in a word, would entrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breastworks as my uncle toby would acitadel."
1383,3699-175950-0003.flac," you must mean your uncles, replied my great-grandmother. my great-grandfather was convinced. he untwisted the paper and signed the article."
1384,3699-175950-0013.flac," as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple, it becomes his own, and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than give it up."
1385,3699-175950-0018.flac," they had caused him moreover as much labor and cooking and digesting as in the case above, so that they might well and truly be said to be of his own goods and chattels. accordingly, he held fast by him, both by teeth and claws."
1386,3699-175950-0014.flac," the apple is as much frank's apple as john's. pray, mr. shandy, what patent has he to show for it? and how did it begin to be his? was it when he set his heart upon it, or when he gathered it?"
1387,3699-175950-0008.flac," so that the whimsicality of my father's brain was far from having the whole honor of this, as it had of almost all his other strange notions. for in a great measure he might be said to have sucked this in with his mother's milk."
1388,3699-19401-0026.flac," but the account of this is worth more than to be woven into the fag and of the eighth, alluding to the first edition, volume of such a work as this."
1389,3699-19401-0004.flac," into a core, no matter whether he loves the service or no. being once in it, he acts as if he did and takes every step to show himself a man of prowess."
1390,3699-19401-0006.flac," for this reason, continued my father stating the case over again, notwithstanding all the world knows that mrs. wattman affects my brother toby, and my brother toby contrary wise affects mrs. wattman."
1391,3699-19401-0012.flac," by falling in love with a popish clergywoman said trim. ""'twas a beguine,' said my uncle toby. dr. slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction."""
1392,3699-19401-0024.flac," whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions, my uncle toby and the corporal were busy in preparing everything for the attack. as the turning of the thin scarlet breaches was laid aside at least for the present."
1393,3699-19401-0019.flac," once at least every four or five days, but often are if convenient, less than taking off thy wig before her through absence of mind, she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by time, how much by trim."
1394,3699-19401-0000.flac," my father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a flashing way with him in his disputations, thrusting and ripping and giving everyone a stroke to remember him by in his turn."
1395,3699-19401-0002.flac," they are as rotten as dirt,"" said the corporal. then by all means said my father, be speak a new pair, brother. for though i know continued my father turning himself to the company,"
1396,3699-19401-0014.flac," and perhaps it is as well for thee, though not so well for me, that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head, and that i am able to write it to thee. had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots,"
1397,3699-19401-0025.flac," there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning, so accordingly it was resolved upon for 11 o'clock."
1398,3699-19401-0022.flac," they are all books which excite laughter, and thou knowest dear toby that there is no passion so serious as lust. stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou interest her parlor."
1399,3699-19401-0021.flac," for this cause, if thou canst help it, never throw down the tongs into poker. avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in light discourse with her."
1400,3699-19401-0013.flac," and my father, taking that very crisis to fall in helter's skelter upon the whole order of nuns and bigines, a set of silly, fussy baggages, slop could not stand it. and my uncle toby, having some measures to take about his breaches,"
1401,3699-19401-0009.flac," now, trim's montero cap, as i once told you, was his constant wager, and having furbished it up that very night in order to go upon the attack, it made the odds look more considerable."
1402,3699-19401-0020.flac," whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to utter it in a low, soft tone of voice. silence, and whatever approaches it, weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain."
1403,3699-19401-0018.flac," without first recommending thyself to the protection of almighty god, that he may defend the from the evil one. shave the whole top of thy crown, clean."
1404,3699-19401-0011.flac," that widow-wadman and pleaser worship cannot hold it out ten days. and whence, cried slop, jeeringly, has thou all this knowledge of woman, friend?"
1405,3699-19401-0017.flac," yet i would remind thee of one during the continuance of thy courtship, in a particular manner, which i would not have omitted. and that is, never to go forth upon the enterprise, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon,"
1406,3699-19401-0015.flac," mrs. shandy being now close beside me, preparing for bed. i have thrown together without order and just as they have come into my mind, such hints and documents as i deem maybe of use to thee."
1407,3699-19401-0008.flac," we have taken our measures badly,"" quote my uncle toby, looking up interrogatively in trim's face. ""'i would lay my montero camp,' said trim."
1408,3699-19401-0001.flac," for that the tailor in ripping them up in order to turn them had found that they had been turned before. then turn them again, brother, said my father rapidly, for there will be many a turning of them yet before all is done in the affair."
1409,3699-19401-0005.flac," the hypothesis, like the rest of my father's, was plausible enough, and my uncle toby had but a single word to object to it, in which trim stood ready to second him, but my father had not drawn his conclusion."
1410,3699-19401-0023.flac," there is nothing further for thee which accrues to me at present, unless the breaking out of a fresh war. so wishing everything dear toby for best, i rest thy affectionate brother, walter shandy."
1411,3699-19401-0007.flac," and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night, yet will i answer for it that this self-same tune will not be played this 12 month."
1412,3699-19401-0010.flac," i would lay and please your honor my montero cap to a shilling, was it proper, continued trim, making a bow, to offer a wager before your honors? there is nothing improper in it,"" said my father."
1413,3699-19401-0016.flac," though i perceive from a glow in my cheek the thai blushes i begin to speak to thee upon the subject, as well knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of its offices thou neglectest."
1414,3699-19401-0003.flac," that widowodman has been deeply in love with my brother toby for many years, and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion, yet now that she has caught him, her fever will be past its height."
1415,3699-47246-0018.flac," was difficult to be met with at watering places, which were already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauties, and were chiefly stocked with men whose whiskers might be dyed, and whose incomes were still more problematic."
1416,3699-47246-0019.flac," so she had determined on trying a neighborhood where people were extremely well acquainted with each other's affairs, and where the women were mostly ill-dressed and ugly."
1417,3699-47246-0003.flac," and which would be utterly overturned and nullified by the destruction of that premise. mrs. fipps, the banker's wife and mrs. lander, the attorney's wife, had invested part of their reputation for acuteness,"
1418,3699-47246-0024.flac," why it must by in the possession of some vices from which they were undeniably free. hence, it came to pass that milby's respectability refused to recognize the countess cherlaski."
1419,3699-47246-0027.flac," and shun a coldly satirical eye as she was shun a gorgon. and she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship, not merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society."
1420,3699-47246-0028.flac," and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that quarter. she had serious intentions of becoming quite pious without any reserves, when she had once got her carriage and settlement."
1421,3699-47246-0012.flac," of the smallest description, indeed, he would not have ventured to call it his own. he might be slightly recalcitrant now and then, as is the habit of long-eared packy-derms under the thong of the fair countess's tongue,"
1422,3699-47246-0015.flac," whom he initiated into the mysteries of the paddeba and the lances quadrioles. she had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with chalaski, who had taken her to paris and germany."
1423,3699-47246-0031.flac," thus, there was really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and attentions to mr. ann mrs. barton."
1424,3699-47246-0006.flac," miss fipps, for her part, didn't like dressing for effect. she had always avoided that style of appearance which was calculated to create a sensation."
1425,3699-47246-0026.flac, so she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighborhood where people are well acquainted with each other's private affairs.
1426,3699-47246-0004.flac," had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the other ladies, manifest superiority in personal charms. miss fipps' stumpy figure and unsuccessful attire."
1427,3699-47246-0007.flac," then, what amusing innuendos of the milby gentleman over their wine would have been entirely frustrated and reduced to naught if you had told them that the countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanors, which demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society."
1428,3699-47246-0020.flac," and give him at least a sort of cousinship to the quarter-sessions. all this, which was the simple truth, would have seemed extremely flat to the gossip of milbi, who had made up their minds to something much more exciting."
1429,3699-47246-0032.flac," still, their friendship, by no means adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to milby, and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother."
1430,3699-47246-0010.flac," mr. bridman, in fact, quadrigenery and bachelor as he was, felt extremely well pleased to receive his sister in her widowhood and to shine in the reflected light of her beauty and title."
1431,3699-47246-0021.flac," there was nothing here so very detestable. it is true the countess was a little vain, a little ambitious, a little selfish, a little shallow and frivolous, a little given to white lies. but…"
1432,3699-47246-0016.flac," not indeed any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom, but much external polish and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind."
1433,3699-47246-0013.flac," and there was always the possibility that mr. bridman's first nuptials might occur before the countess was quite sure of her second. as it was, however, he submitted to all his sister's caprices"
1434,3699-47246-0029.flac," the countess did not quote sophocles, but she said to herself, only this little bit of pretense and vanity, and then i will be quite good, and make myself quite safe for another world."
1435,3699-47246-0002.flac," besides, think of all the virtuous declamation, all the penetrating observation, which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position that the countess was a very objectionable person indeed."
1436,3699-47246-0022.flac," who considers such slight blemishes such moral pimples as these, disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society. indeed,"
1437,3699-47246-0008.flac," had subsequently given dancing lessons in the metropolis. that mr. bridman was neither more nor less than her half-brother, who by unimpeached integrity and industry."
1438,3699-47246-0000.flac, chapter 4
1439,3699-47246-0001.flac," nice distinctions are troublesome. it is so much easier to say that a thing is black than to discriminate the particular shade of brown, blue, or green to which it really belongs."
1440,3699-47246-0005.flac," instead of looking down from a mount of virtue with an oriol around its head, would then be seen on the same level and in the same light as the countess chalazki's diana-like form and well-chosen drapery."
1441,3699-47246-0011.flac," every man who is not a monster, a mathematician, or a mad philosopher is the slave of some woman or other, mr. bridman had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister, and though his soul was a very little one."
1442,3699-47246-0023.flac," the severest ladies in milbi would have been perfectly aware that these characteristics would have created no wide distinction between the countess cherlaski and themselves, and since it was clear there was a wide distinction."
1443,3699-47246-0017.flac," one of these conclusions was that there were things more solid in life than fine whiskers and title, and that in accepting a second husband."
1444,3699-47246-0025.flac," in spite of her as siduous church going, and the deep disgust she was known to have expressed, at the extreme posity of the congregations on ash wednesdays."
1445,3699-47246-0030.flac," for you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the countess was absorbingly devoted, and to whose desires she made everything else subservient, namely, caroline cherlaski, nay, bridman."
1446,3699-47246-0014.flac, as personages on the debatable ground between aristocracy and commonality. instead of settling in some spot where his 500 a year might have won him the definite dignity of a parochial magnate.
1447,3699-47246-0009.flac," had won a partnership in a silk manufacturing, and thereby a moderate fortune that enabled him to retire as you see to study politics, the weather, and the art of conversation at his leisure."
1448,229-130880-0017.flac," the englishman percival made much of a caffir, who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface. but i find that hard to believe."
1449,229-130880-0068.flac," the canadian said. no, my friend, that task is performed with 11 strainers or sivs that are pierced with different numbers of holes. those pearls staying in the strainers with 20 to 80 holes are in the first order."
1450,229-130880-0085.flac," conceal put in. and why not? what good would a poor or worth millions do us here on the nautilus? here, no. ned land said, but elsewhere. oh, elsewhere. conceal put in."
1451,229-130880-0086.flac," shaking his head. in fact, i said, mr. land is right. and if we ever brought back to europe or america a pearl worth millions, it would make the story of our adventures more authentic and much more rewarding. that's how i see it."
1452,229-130880-0062.flac," first, they remove the layers of mother of pearl, which are known in the industry by the name's legitimate silver, bastard white or bastard black."
1453,229-130880-0008.flac, who went out immediately. soon the nautilus re-entered this liquid element and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of 30 feet. with the chart under my eyes
1454,229-130880-0076.flac," consel replied, but when a little glass of vinegar is worth 1,500,000 francs, its taste is a small price to pay."
1455,229-130880-0046.flac," alright, sit down, my friends."
1456,229-130880-0003.flac," its length is 275 miles. its maximum width is 150 miles. its circumference is 900 miles. its surface area is 24,448 square miles."
1457,229-130880-0090.flac," the canadian replied, i'm a professional heart-punner. it's my job to make a mockery of them."" it isn't an issue, i said, of fishing for them with a swivel hook, hoisting them onto a deck of a ship."
1458,229-130880-0006.flac," certainly, captain. fine. it's easily done. only when we see the fisheries will see no fisherman."
1459,229-130880-0071.flac," these ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of 3 million manitors. franks! consale rebuked. yes, franks. 3 million franks, i went on."
1460,229-130880-0009.flac, i found it by the 9th parallel of the northwestern shores of salon.
1461,229-130880-0084.flac," consale said quickly. yes, i said. two million francs. and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up. ha! nedland exclaimed. during our stroll tomorrow, who says we won't run into one just like it."
1462,229-130880-0073.flac," but now they bring in only two-thirds of that amount. all in all, it's estimated that 9 million francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl harvesting industry. but conso asked..."
1463,229-130880-0060.flac," but will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls? one proceeds in several ways, and often when pearls stick to the valves, fishermen even pull them loose with pliers."
1464,229-130880-0031.flac," hunting otters and underwater forests, as we did in the forest of crespo island, is an acceptable activity."
1465,229-130880-0074.flac," haven't certain famous pearls been quoted at extremely high prices? yes, my boy."
1466,229-130880-0045.flac," conceal said to me, give us some background on profishing. on the fishing itself, i asked, or on the occupational hazards that, on the fishing, the canadian replied, before we tackled the terrain, it helps to be familiar with it."
1467,229-130880-0078.flac," i even bought a pro necklace from my fiance, kate tender. but she married somebody else instead."
1468,229-130880-0022.flac," it's even said that in 1814, when the english government went fishing on its own behalf, its divers worked just 20 days and brought up 76 million oysters."
1469,229-130880-0036.flac," thank heavens i said to myself, consell will never want to come along, and that will be my excuse for not going with the captain. as for nedland, i admit i felt less confident of his wisdom."
1470,229-130880-0087.flac," the candy lady said, but said conçal, who perpetually returned to the didactic side of things, is this profishing ever dangerous? no, i replied quickly, especially if one takes certain precautions."
1471,229-130880-0061.flac," thus they die in the open air, and by the end of ten days they've rotted sufficiently. next they're immersed in huge tanks of salt water, then they're opened up and washed. at this point the sorters begin their twofold task."
1472,229-130880-0040.flac," for a visit tomorrow to cillan's magnificent profissaries. he did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman. he didn't tell you anything else? nothing, sir. the canadian replied."
1473,229-130880-0035.flac, and how i resented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation.
1474,229-130880-0041.flac," he said, you'd already discussed this little stroll. indeed, i said. but didn't he give you any details on not a one, mr. naturalist? you will be going with us, right? me?"
1475,229-130880-0075.flac," i've even heard stories the canadian said about some lady in ancient times who drank pearls and vinegar. cleopatra, conceal, shot back. it must have tasted pretty bad, nedland added. a bombatable ned, my friend."
1476,229-130880-0091.flac," opening the belly, ripping out the heart and tossing it into the sea. so it's an issue of yes, precisely, in the water, in the water. ye gods, just give me a good harpoon."
1477,229-130880-0047.flac," ned and conçal took seats on the couch and right off the canadian said to me, sir, just what is a pearl exactly? my gallant ned, i replied, for poets, a pearl is a tear from the sea."
1478,229-130880-0072.flac," but i don't think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did. similarly, the central american fisheries"
1479,229-130880-0005.flac," is famous for its pearl fisheries. would you be interested, professor aronax?"
1480,229-130880-0056.flac," on the valves, a pearl sticks fast. on the flesh, it lies loose. but as nucleus is always some small, hard object, say a sterile egg or a grain of sand."
1481,229-130880-0023.flac," the fisherman are well paid, aren't they? hardly, professor. and panama, they make just one dollar per week. in most places, they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl, and they bring up so many that have none."
1482,229-130880-0037.flac," danger, however great, held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature. i went back to reading sir's book, but i leafed through it mechanically. between the lines, it kept seeing fearsome, wide open jaws."
1483,229-130880-0089.flac," by the way, gallant ned, are you afraid of sharks?"
1484,229-130880-0014.flac, that such primitive methods are still all that they use. all.
1485,229-130880-0044.flac," for my part, i stared at them with anxious eyes, as if they were already missing a limb or two. should i alert them? yes, surely. but i hardly knew how to go about it. would master"
1486,229-130880-0063.flac," then, they remove the oyster's meaty tissue, boil it, and finally strain it in order to extract even the smallest pearls. do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size?"" conceil asked. not only on their size, i replied,"
1487,229-130880-0020.flac," their vision weakens, ulcered, sprake out on their eyes, sores form on their bodies, and some are even stricken with epilepsy on the ocean floor. yes, i said, it's a sad occupation."
1488,229-130880-0079.flac, but you can absolutely trust me on this professor. its pearls were so big
1489,229-130880-0001.flac," that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula. i went looking in the library for a book about this island, one of the most fertile in the world. sure enough, i found a volume entitled ceylon and the sengalese."
1490,229-130880-0019.flac," i believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is 30 seconds, during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose."
1491,229-130880-0027.flac," the rest of us, captain nemo answered, and in time you will be too. anyhow, we'll be armed, and on our way we might hunt a man-eater or two. it's a fascinating sport. so, professor, i'll see you tomorrow."
1492,229-130880-0032.flac," that's another story. i know that in certain countries, particularly the andaman islands, negroes don't hesitate to attack sharks, dagger in one hand and loosen the other."
1493,229-130880-0055.flac, that valuable shellfish. pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape. either they stick to the oyster shell or they become embedded in the creature's folds.
1494,229-130880-0013.flac," dive in rotation, and descend to a depth of 12 meters with the help of a heavy stone cletched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat. you mean, i said,"
1495,229-130880-0038.flac," just then, consell and the canadian entered with a calm, even gleeful air. little did they know what was waiting for them. ye god, sir! ned land told me. your captain nemo, the devil, take him."
1496,229-130880-0052.flac," turbosnails, giant clams, and saltwater scallops. briefly, all those that secrete mother of pearl, in other words, that blue, azure, violet, or white substance,"
1497,229-130880-0011.flac," the seas of china and japan, plus those seas south of the united states, the gulf of panama and the gulf of california. but it's off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards. no doubt we'll be arriving a little early."
1498,229-130880-0081.flac, that essence of orient must self-equated large sum. as little as zero. it comes from the scales of a european carp. it's nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia. it's worthless.
1499,229-130880-0004.flac," in other words, a little smaller than that of ireland. just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared. the captain glanced at the chart, then turning to me. the island of salon, he said."
1500,229-130880-0030.flac," you might want to think it over before accepting. as for me, i passed a hand over my brow, where beads of cold sweat were busy forming. let's think this over, i said to myself, and let's take our time."
1501,229-130880-0058.flac, they even mention one oyster about which i remain dubious.
1502,229-130880-0015.flac," although these fisheries belong to the most industrialized people in the world, the english."
1503,229-130880-0083.flac," this one, consell said, pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case. exactly. and i'm certainly not far off when i estimate its value at two million francs."
1504,229-130880-0069.flac," those not slipping through the sieves pierced with 100 to 800 holes are in the second order. finally, those pearls for which one uses strainers pierced with 900 to 1000 holes make up the seed pearls."
1505,229-130880-0048.flac," for orientals, it's a drop of solidified dew. for the ladies, it's a jewel."
1506,229-130880-0066.flac," the pear-shaped ones into ear rings. and since they're the most valuable, they're priced individually. the other pearls that stick to the oysters shell are more erratically shaped and are priced by weight. finally, clasped in the lowest order,"
1507,229-130880-0053.flac," lining the insides of their valves. are muscles included too, the canadian asked? yes, the muscles of certain streams in scotland, whales, ireland, saxony, bohemia, and france."
1508,229-130880-0054.flac," good,"" the canadian replied. from now on, we'll pay closer attention to him. but i went on. for secreting pearls, the ideal mullisk is the pearl oyster, melagrina margaritaphera."
1509,229-130880-0067.flac," the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls. they're priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments. but it must be a long, hard job sorting out these pearls by size."
1510,229-130880-0070.flac," how ingenious,"" consale said, to reduce dividing and classifying pearls to a mechanical operation. and could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters? according to sir's book, i replied,"
1511,229-130880-0082.flac," maybe that's why kate tender married somebody else, replied mr. land philosophically. but i said, getting back to pearls of great value, i don't think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by captain nemo."
1512,229-130880-0065.flac," they form an isolation within the mollusks tissue. they're white. often opaque, but sometimes of opal-lessent transparency. and usually spherical or pear-shaped. the spherical ones are made into bracelets."
1513,229-130880-0034.flac," and there i was, fantasizing about sharks, envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half. i could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle."
1514,229-130880-0024.flac," only one penny to those poor people who make their employer's rich does the trotious. on that note, professor, captain nemo told me."
1515,229-130880-0057.flac," around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin, concentric layers over several years in succession. can one find several pearls in the same oyster? concel asked. yes, my boy."
1516,229-130880-0007.flac, and we'll arrive there late tonight.
1517,229-130880-0049.flac," necks and ears that's oblong in shape, glassy in luster, and formed from mother of pearl. for chemists, it's a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protein."
1518,229-130880-0039.flac," has just made us a very pleasant proposition. oh, i said, you know about, with all due respect to master, consell replied, the nautilus' commander has invited us together with master,"
1519,229-130880-0018.flac," i know that some diaries can last up to 57 seconds and highly skillful ones to 87, but such men are rare."
1520,229-130880-0051.flac," asophila, order, tesacea. correct, my scholarly con sale? now then, those tesacea, capable of producing pearls, include rainbow abalone,"
1521,229-130880-0025.flac," and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early, well, we can watch him at work. that suits me, captain. by the way, professor aeronax, you aren't afraid of sharks, are you? sharks, i exclaimed."
1522,229-130880-0050.flac," and finally, for naturalists, it's a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother of pearl in certain bivalves. branch, molissa, consell said, class,"
1523,229-130880-0026.flac," this struck me as a pretty needless question to say the least. well, captain nemo went on. i admit, captain, i'm not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish. we're used to them."
1524,229-130880-0043.flac," dangerous, nedland replied. a simple trip to an oyster bank? surely."
1525,229-130880-0033.flac," but i also know that many who face those fearsome animals don't come back alive. besides, i'm not a negro, and even if i were a negro, in this instance i don't think a little hesitation on my part would be out of place."
1526,229-130880-0010.flac," to reach it, we had to go all the way up salon's west coast. professor captain nemo then told me, there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal, the seas of the east indies,"
1527,229-130880-0093.flac," well, how about you, consail? what are your feelings about these manitors? me, consail said, i'm afraid i must be frank with master. good for you, i thought."
1528,229-130880-0092.flac," you see, sir, these sharks are badly designed. they have to roll their bellies over to snap you up. and in the meantime, ned land had a way of pronouncing the word snap."
1529,229-130880-0012.flac," only during the month of march, and for 30 days some 300 boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea. each boat is manned by ten orsmans and ten fishermen. the latter divide into two groups."
1530,229-130880-0000.flac," right off, i observed a cluster of mountains about 2,000 feet high, whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted. after our position fix, i re-entered the lounge, and when our bearings were reported on the chart, i saw that we were off the island of ceylon."
1531,229-130880-0021.flac," and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion. but tell me, captain, how many oysters can a boat fish up in a work day?"
1532,229-130880-0028.flac," bright and early. this said in a carefree tone, captain nemo left the lounge. if you're invited to hunt bears in the swiss mountains, you might say, oh, good! i get to go bear hunting tomorrow!"
1533,229-130880-0029.flac," if you're invited to hunt lions on the atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of india, you might say, ha! now's my chance to hunt lions and tigers. but if you're invited to hunt sharks in their native element,"
1534,229-130880-0077.flac," nedland married to cleopatra, consell exclaimed. but i was all set to tie the knot, consell, the canadian replied in all seriousness."
1535,229-130880-0042.flac," why, yes, certainly, of course. i can see that you like the idea, mr. land. yes, it will be a really unusual experience. and possibly dangerous? i added an insinuating tone."
1536,229-130880-0016.flac," yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work. yes, since those poor fishermen can't stay long underwater. on his voyage to salon,"
1537,229-130880-0080.flac," my gallant ned,"" i replied, laughing. those were artificial pearls, ordinary glass beads, whose insides were coated with essence of orient. wow!"
1538,229-130880-0059.flac," nedland yoped. did i say sharks? i exclaimed hastily. i meant 150 pearls. sharks wouldn't make sense. indeed, consell said."
1539,229-130880-0002.flac," reentering the lounge, i first noted the bearings of célon, on which antiquity lavish so many different names."
1540,229-130880-0064.flac," but also according to their shape, their water. in other words, their color and their orient. in other words, that dappled shimmering glow that makes them so delightful to the eye. the finest pearls are called virgin pearls or paragons."
1541,229-130880-0088.flac," what risks would you run in a job like that, nidland said, swallowing a few gulps of salt water? what if you say ned? then, trying to imitate captain nemo's carefree tone, i asked."
1542,60-121082-0093.flac," i hope i am not the cause."" hush! said andrea, they passed the barrier without accident. at the first cross-street."
1543,60-121082-0091.flac," he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself. but tell me, said andrea."
1544,60-121082-0055.flac," as you say just now, you are a native of a marseille. i am. do you know then now what you are? no, but i was brought up in corsica. you are old and obstinate."
1545,60-121082-0035.flac," at this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went towards his groom saying, this man is right, i did indeed charge him with a commission, the result of which he must tell me. walk to the barrier."
1546,60-121082-0054.flac," that is not right. take care. or i may become troublesome."" this menace smothered the young man's passion. he urged the horse again into a trot."
1547,60-121082-0028.flac," he asked, pardon me, my friend if i disturb you,"" said the man with the red-hanger chief, but i want to speak to you. you have no right to beg at night."
1548,60-121082-0032.flac," i can scarcely stand. the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity. tell me, he said. tell me what you want. well then."
1549,60-121082-0067.flac," there now, again, you to grade me. how so? by making me apply to the servants, one i want to transact business with you alone. well, be it so then."
1550,60-121082-0071.flac," so far, i have appeared to answer his purpose. and who found this father for you? the count of monte cristo."
1551,60-121082-0056.flac," i am young and willful. between people like us, threats are out of place. everything should be amicably arranged. is it my fault if fortune?"
1552,60-121082-0025.flac," torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they would rattle as he walked. and the hand, with which he leaned upon the young man's shoulder,"
1553,60-121082-0037.flac," all take you to a splendid place."" said the man with the handkerchief, and taking the horse's bit, he led the tilbury, where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him."
1554,60-121082-0086.flac," who had never taken his eyes off his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long spanish knife, which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need."
1555,60-121082-0024.flac," and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth, pointed in sharp as the wolves or jackals. a red hanker chief encircled his grey head."
1556,60-121082-0023.flac," and had returned just as they were starting. but instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face, sunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles."
1557,60-121082-0041.flac," andreah looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard. and then, stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked, now."
1558,60-121082-0030.flac," i only wish to say two or three words to your master, who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago. come, said andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation. what do you want?"
1559,60-121082-0094.flac," well, said andrea."
1560,60-121082-0007.flac," amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king's attorney. then he had been seized upon by danglar, who, with the rapid glance at the stiff-necked old major and his modest son,"
1561,60-121082-0074.flac," yes, you. it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me. since you interest yourself in my affairs, i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions. ah, true."
1562,60-121082-0047.flac," come, come. what then? patience. patience. i am patient, but go on."
1563,60-121082-0015.flac, by the same means used by the count to bring the lamprays from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the vulga. thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalconty pronounce these words.
1564,60-121082-0062.flac," he is not a prince. simply account. account? and a rich one too, eh? yes. but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he's not a very good tempered gentleman."
1565,60-121082-0085.flac," where it began playing with the pistol. but, meanwhile,"
1566,60-121082-0036.flac," there, take a cab that you may not be too late. the surprise groom retired. let me at least reach a shady spot, said andrea. oh, as for that."
1567,60-121082-0070.flac," a real father. yes, so long as he pays me. you'll honor and believe him. that's right. what is his name? major cavalcanti."
1568,60-121082-0002.flac," as for m. danglar, absorbed in an interesting conversation with m. cavalconty, he paid no attention to anything that was passing."
1569,60-121082-0031.flac," speak quickly, friend. the man said in a low voice. i wish. i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris. i am very tired, and as i have not eaten so good at dinner as you."
1570,60-121082-0077.flac," do you think so, emberset? and you?"
1571,60-121082-0029.flac," said the groom, and devering to rid his master of the troublesome intruder. i am not begging my fine fellow,"" said the unknown to the servant, with so ironical and expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile that he withdrew."
1572,60-121082-0083.flac," and goodbye to my dream of resembling the retired baker. no, no, my boy. i prefer remaining honorably in the capital. andrea scowlt. certainly."
1573,60-121082-0087.flac," the two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one another. andreas hand left his pocket in offensively and was carried up to the red mustache, which had played with for some time."
1574,60-121082-0027.flac," or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator? we cannot say, but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly."
1575,60-121082-0005.flac," had offered him a seat in his carriage. andrea cavalcanti found his tillberry waiting at the door, the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion."
1576,60-121082-0038.flac," don't think i want the glory of writing in your fine carriage,"" said he, oh no, it's only because i am tired, and also because i have a little business to talk over with you."
1577,60-121082-0039.flac," come, step in,"" said the young man. it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight. for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury."
1578,60-121082-0052.flac," you are lucky. i wish i could say as much, for i do conceal myself, and then i was afraid you would not recognize me. but you did."
1579,60-121082-0082.flac, this would cause inquiries. it would be found that i left too long without giving due notice. and that i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean. then i should become simply
1580,60-121082-0013.flac, by declaring in what lake the best lampries were caught. then he had eaten some without saying a word more.
1581,60-121082-0011.flac," were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker's servants. so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon. one thing above all the rest, heightened the respect."
1582,60-121082-0089.flac, but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion? it seems to me...
1583,60-121082-0045.flac," that you are mistaken. well, well, don't be angry, my boy. you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate, and misfortunes make us jealous."
1584,60-121082-0059.flac," rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet? you would not have known me. you wronged me, my boy. now i have found you. nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone, knowing as i do."
1585,60-121082-0061.flac," what an appetite you used to have. is it as good now? oh, yes. replyed andrea, laughing."
1586,60-121082-0033.flac, i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back. andre turned pale but said nothing.
1587,60-121082-0009.flac," he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major's little finger. for the major, like a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his bank notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset."
1588,60-121082-0042.flac, let me ask you why you deceived me. how have i deceived you? how do you ask?
1589,60-121082-0066.flac," but that with...with? with 150 francs. i should be quite happy. here are 200, said andrea."
1590,60-121082-0018.flac," and that not having come together, it would not be difficult for them to leave separately. the major seated himself, therefore, by the side of danglar."
1591,60-121082-0001.flac," was the first to give the signal of departure. he offered his seat in his land out to madame danglar, that she might be under the care of his wife."
1592,60-121082-0096.flac," and running into a court, he disappeared. a lasse, said andrea, sighing."
1593,60-121082-0049.flac, i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you.
1594,60-121082-0078.flac," a peer of france? ah, said andrea, who knows? major cavalconty is already one, perhaps. but then, hereditary rank is abolished."
1595,60-121082-0057.flac," has been kind to me? fortune has been kind to you then. your tilbury, your groom, your clothes, are not then hired? good."
1596,60-121082-0043.flac," but instead of that, you come to paris. how does that annoy you? it does not. on the contrary, i think it will answer my purpose. so said andrea."
1597,60-121082-0092.flac," it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off. come, come, enough of this,"" said cavalconty."
1598,60-121082-0060.flac," the goodness of your heart. if you have two coats, you will give me one of them. i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry."" true, said andrea."
1599,60-121082-0006.flac," was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse. andrea had spoken very little during dinner. he was an intelligent lad, and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people."
1600,60-121082-0063.flac," obeasy, i have no design upon your count, and you shall have him all to yourself. but..."
1601,60-121082-0064.flac, you must pay for it. you understand. well.
1602,60-121082-0008.flac," and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of some nebob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir."
1603,60-121082-0048.flac," you must have discovered a mine, or else become a stockbroker. so that, as you confess, you are jealous? no. i am pleased. so pleased that i wish to congratulate you."
1604,60-121082-0072.flac, the man whose house you have just left? yes.
1605,60-121082-0026.flac," and which was the first thing andreas saw, seemed of gigantic size. did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tillberry?"
1606,60-121082-0084.flac," as he had himself owned, the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a willful fellow. he drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket."
1607,60-121082-0050.flac," you speak to me before my servant. how can i help that, my boy? i speak to you when i can catch you. you have a quick horse, a light tillbury."
1608,60-121082-0016.flac," tomorrow, sir, i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business. and i, sir,"" said danglar, shall be most happy to receive you."
1609,60-121082-0044.flac, you are speculating upon me? what fine words he uses.
1610,60-121082-0088.flac," he said, how happy you will be. i will do my best,"" said the inkeeper of the ponder guard, shutting up his knife. well, then, we will go to paris."
1611,60-121082-0003.flac," he had noticed the approach of villaford to madame danglar, and he soon guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice."
1612,60-121082-0053.flac," with his unpleasant smile. it was very polite of you."" come, said andrea. what do you want? you do not speak affectionately to me, benedetto, my old friend."
1613,60-121082-0046.flac," i thought you were earning a living in tuskini or pedmont by acting as vacuino or cissaron, and i pitted you sincerely as i would a child of my own. you know, i always did call you my child."
1614,60-121082-0051.flac," you are naturally a slippery as an eel. if i had missed you tonight, i might not have had another chance."
1615,60-121082-0095.flac," you would not like me to risk taking cold. but what am i to do? you. oh, you are young while i am beginning to get old. arava, benedetto."
1616,60-121082-0075.flac," well, i shall rent a room in some respectable house, where a decent coat. shave every day. and go and read the paper in the cafe. then, in the evening, i shall go to the theatre."
1617,60-121082-0080.flac," how? not at all? why? just think for a moment. with this red handkerchief on my head, with scarcely any shoes?"
1618,60-121082-0012.flac," nay almost the veneration of danglar for cavalconty. the latter, faithful to the principle of horus, nile admarrari, had contented himself with showing his knowledge"
1619,60-121082-0034.flac," yes, said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking imputedly at the youth. i have taken the whim into my head. do you understand, master benadetto?"
1620,60-121082-0076.flac," i shall look like some retired baker. that is what i want. come. if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady, nothing could be better."
1621,60-121082-0004.flac," without opposing their arrangements, he allowed morrell, chateau renau, and debrae to leave on horseback, and the ladies in m. de villaford's carriage. danglar, more and more delighted with major cavalconty,"
1622,60-121082-0040.flac," andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself traveling in so comfortable a vehicle."
1623,60-121082-0069.flac," but tell me all about it. why do you wish to know? asked cavalconty. what? do you again defy me? no. the fact is, i have found my father. what?"
1624,60-121082-0022.flac," who, taking them from him, rested his polished boot lightly on the step. at that moment, a hand touched his shoulder. the young man turned round."
1625,60-121082-0014.flac," danglar, therefore, concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalconty. who, most likely in luka, fed upon trout brought from switzerland, and lobsters sent from england?"
1626,60-121082-0073.flac," since he holds the money chest. well, i will mention you to him. meanwhile, what are you going to do?"
1627,60-121082-0020.flac," as for andrea, he began by way of showing off to scold his groom, who instead of bringing the tillberry to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door. thus,"
1628,60-121082-0021.flac," giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it. the groom heard him with humility, took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held out the reins to andrea."
1629,60-121082-0090.flac," we shall see."" he then took the great coat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back. then he took off cowell county's hat which he placed upon his own head. and finally..."
1630,60-121082-0058.flac," his eyes sparkling with avarice. o, you knew that well enough before speaking to me, said andrea, becoming more and more excited, if i had been wearing a hankerchief like yours on my head."
1631,60-121082-0017.flac," if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son. to this, cavalconty replied by saying that for some time past, his son had lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and carriages,"
1632,60-121082-0065.flac," i think that with a hundred francs a month, well i could live upon a hundred francs. come, you understand me."
1633,60-121082-0079.flac," and now that you have all you want, and that we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear."
1634,60-121082-0019.flac," who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man. and yet, who, being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year,"
1635,60-121082-0068.flac," take it from me then, and so long at least, as i receive my income, you shall be paid yours."" come, come, i always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you."
1636,60-121082-0000.flac," the evening passed on. madame de villaford expressed a desire to return to paris, which madame denglar had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced. on his wife's request, madame de villaford,"
1637,60-121082-0010.flac," then, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living, and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglar the one was to receive his 48,000 francs."
1638,60-121082-0081.flac," what was there before, making an all about 200 francs? why, i should certainly be arrested at the barriers, then, to justify myself, i should say that you gave me the money."
1639,1578-6379-0043.flac," young, wait till you see me with my hair done up."
1640,1578-6379-0036.flac," talking to men. did you tell the dowager? yes, i told her about getting the wrong suitcase. i didn't mention the fact that it belonged to the third man from the end. what did she say? she said it was very careless of me to run off with a strange man's luggage."
1641,1578-6379-0014.flac," and things? where do you get it? well, said patty languidly, it's a long story."
1642,1578-6379-0032.flac," the man who took me into dinner never dreamed that i hadn't been out for years, and you know he tried to flirt with me, he did really, and he was getting awfully old, he must have been almost forty. i felt as though i were flirting with my grandfather. you know, petyated, it isn't so bad being grown up."
1643,1578-6379-0013.flac," is it locked? yes, patty nodded, but my key will open it."
1644,1578-6379-0027.flac," what's the matter with it?"" she just waved her hand toward the table and didn't say word, and there it was, wide open. patty took a key from her pocket, unlocked the suitcase, and threw back the lid. a man's dress suit was neatly folded on the top, with a pipe, a box of cigarettes, some colors."
1645,1578-6379-0046.flac," while the others in a flutter of excitement thrust in the coat and re-locked the suitcase. they crowded after her in a body and hung over the bandisters at a perilous angle, straining their ears in the direction of the drawing-room, nothing but a murmur of voices floated up."
1646,1578-6379-0033.flac, before patty resumed her chronicle. and uncle tom made me tell about the suitcase at the dinner table. everybody laughed. it made a very exciting story. i told them about the whole school going to the glee club and falling in love in a body with a third man from the end.
1647,1578-6379-0021.flac," oh, connie murmured disappointedly. then what happened, priscilla asked? nothing at all. i got out at coomsdale, and uncle tom met me with the automobile. the chauffeur took my suitcase from the porter, and i didn't see it near too at all. we reached the house just at t-time."
1648,1578-6379-0022.flac," and i went straight into tea without going upstairs. the butler took up my suitcase and they made cayman ask for the key so she could unpack. the house is simply running over with servants, i'm always scared to death."
1649,1578-6379-0006.flac," there it is. take it upstairs. i'll be with you as soon as i've reported. but that isn't your suitcase. patty shook her head mysteriously. if you tried a thousand years, you'd never guess who owns it. who? patty laughed."
1650,1578-6379-0035.flac," but you didn't leave it. i came on the other road. i'm going to send it down. and what did you wear at the wedding? louis' is close. it didn't matter a bit, might not matching the other bride's maids, because i was made of honor and ought to dress differently. anyway, i've been grown up for three days."
1651,1578-6379-0020.flac," except german-hillier, jr., and he followed me right into the parlor car and sat down in the chair exactly opposite. hooo! patti! they cried in shocked chorus. you surely didn't speak to him!"
1652,1578-6379-0030.flac," uncle tom lives five miles from town, and there simply wasn't anything we could do that night. i'd just imagine his feelings when he started to dress for the concert, and found patty's new pink evening gown spread out on top, suggested priscilla. oh, patty!"
1653,1578-6379-0016.flac," when we got in, it was crammed full of men. the entire yale glee club was going to the station. there were so many of them that they were sitting in each other's laps. the whole top layer rose and said perfectly gravely and politely, madame, take my seat."
1654,1578-6379-0008.flac," miss jellings was insistent that recreation should be actively pursued out of doors. the two could easily have obtained permission to greet patty's return inside, but it was the policy of the trio never to ask permission in minor matters. it wasted one's credit unnecessarily."
1655,1578-6379-0038.flac, everyone who passed number seven dropped in to hear the news. each in turn received the story of the suitcase and each in turn.
1656,1578-6379-0017.flac," memzel was outraged. she said in french, which of course they all understood, that she thought american college boys had disgraceful manners, but i smiled a little. i couldn't help it. they were so funny. and then two of the bottom ones offered their seats, and we sat down."
1657,1578-6379-0029.flac," he telephoned to the station, but they didn't know anything about it."
1658,1578-6379-0007.flac," just a little souvenir that i picked up, i'll tell you as soon as i've interviewed the dowager, hurry and slip in while jelly isn't looking. they cast a quick glance over their shoulders toward the gymnasium instructor, who was arguing fat irene mccalla into faster movements on the tennis court."
1659,1578-6379-0015.flac," i think you're beastly. well, the glee club was last thursday night."
1660,1578-6379-0018.flac," and you'll never believe it, but the third man from the end was sitting right next to me. not really. oh, patty! is he as good looking near too as he was on the stage? better. are those his real eyebrows or were they blacked?"
1661,1578-6379-0048.flac," they gazed with wide, horrified eyes, and turned without a word to meet patty as she drenched upstairs, lugging her errand suit case. a glance told her that they had seen, and dropping on the top step she leaned her head against the railing and laughed."
1662,1578-6379-0039.flac," doesn't it smell tobacco-y and bay rummish?"" said rosalie paton, sniffing. oh, there's a button loose, cried florence hiss up the careful housewife. where's some black silk, patty? she threaded a needle and secured the button. then she daringly tried on the coat."
1663,1578-6379-0034.flac," and how we all cut his picture out of the program and pasted it in our watches, and then about my sitting across from him in the train and changing suitcases. mr. harper, the man next to me, said it was the most romantic thing he had ever heard in his life, that louise's marriage was nothing to it."
1664,1578-6379-0003.flac," as they came to a stop, they were besieged by a crowd of blue-coated girls. it was afternoon recreation, and the whole school was abroad. the welcome that she received would have led an onlooker to infer that patty had gone three months instead of three days. she and her tube."
1665,1578-6379-0005.flac," they swarmed over the driver's seat in the steps, and two equestrians even purchased themselves on the horse's backs. what's the adventure, demanded connie and priscilla in a breath as the cavalcade rattled off? patty waved her hand toward the suitcase."
1666,1578-6379-0012.flac, truly in honest. patty turned it over and pointed to the initials on the end.
1667,1578-6379-0041.flac," they peered daintily at the other garments. oh! squield, may martell. he wears blue silk suspenders. and something else blue chirped at an a heartwell peering over her shoulder, their pajamas. and to think of such a thing happening to patty."
1668,1578-6379-0009.flac," priscilla and connie turned upstairs, looking the suitcase between them, while patty approached the principal study. ten minutes later, she joined her companions in seven paradise alle. they were sitting on the bed, their chins in their hands."
1669,1578-6379-0002.flac," it was planned to accommodate 20. patty and her suitcase, alone in the capacious interior, were jolting about like two tiny peas in a very big pod."
1670,1578-6379-0001.flac," with the dexterity of practice sprang upon the rear step of the hearse, as it turned in at the school gate and rolled up the curving drive to the port coucher. the hearse was the popular name for the black varnished wagonette which conveyed the pupils of st. ursula's from church and station."
1671,1578-6379-0042.flac," side, may, or tell. why not, prisled patty?"
1672,1578-6379-0010.flac," studying the suitcase propped on the chair before them. well, they inquired in a breath. she said she's glad to see me back and hopes i didn't need too much wedding cake."
1673,1578-6379-0031.flac," just like all my dancing dresses, 9 inches off the floor, with elbow sleeves and a silly sash, i hated it anyway. you must remember you are a schoolgirl con-equoted and until just wait till i tell you, patty triumphed."
1674,1578-6379-0040.flac," eight others followed her example and thrilled at the touch. it was calculated to fit a far larger person than any present, even irene mccullough found it baggy. he had awfully broad shoulders, said rosalie, stroking the satin lining."
1675,1578-6379-0019.flac, she was as flustered as an old hen with one chicken. she put me in charge of a conductor with so many instructions that i know he felt like a newly engaged nurse made. the glee clubman rode in the smoking car.
1676,1578-6379-0028.flac," and various other masculine trifles filling in the interstices. oh, they gasped in breathless chorus. they belonged to him, connie murmured fervently, patty nodded. and when i showed uncle tom that suitcase he nearly died laughing."
1677,1578-6379-0023.flac, all the escher's and bridesmaids were there and everything was very jolly. only i couldn't make out what they were talking about half the time because they all knew each other and had a lot of jokes i couldn't understand.
1678,1578-6379-0037.flac," and she hoped he was a gentleman and would take it nicely. she telephoned to the baggage man that it was here, but she couldn't send martin with it this afternoon because he had to go to the farm for some eggs. recreation was over, and the girls came troops in to gather books and pads and pencils for the approaching study hour."
1679,1578-6379-0045.flac," mrs. trent would like to have miss patty wyatt come to the drawing room, and i am to take the suitcase down. the gentleman is waiting. oh, patty! a gasp went around the room. do your hair up quick! priscilla caught patty's twin braids and wound them around her head."
1680,1578-6379-0004.flac," postilians descended, and martin gathered up his reins. come on, news, all who once arrived to the stables was his hospitable invitation. it inundated him with passengers. they cradded inside, twice as many as the horse would hold."
1681,1578-6379-0024.flac," connie nodded feelingly, that's the way they acted at the seaside last summer. i think grown people have horrid manners. i did feel sort of young, patti acknowledged."
1682,1578-6379-0011.flac," the man with the black eyebrows and the dimple in his chin, who sang the funny songs third from the end of the right-hand side. german hilyard junior, priscilla asked breathlessly. not really, connie later hand on her heart with an exaggerated sigh."
1683,1578-6379-0000.flac," the third man from the end. oh, patty, did you bring us some wedding cake? did you have any adventures?"
1684,1578-6379-0047.flac," punctuated by an occasional deep-based laugh. when they heard the front door close, with one accord, they invaded harriet gladensroom, which commanded the walk and pressed their noses against the pain. a short, thick set man of german build was waddling toward the gate and the trolley car."
1685,1578-6379-0025.flac," he was trying to obey louise and amuse little cousin, but he was thinking all the time."
1686,1578-6379-0026.flac," i told you to put it up,"" said priscilla. ""'just wait,' said patty, portentiously, when i went up stairs to dress for dinner, the maid met me in the hall with her eyes popping out of her head. ""'big pardon, miss patty,' she said, but is that your suitcase?' ""'yes, i said, of course it's my suitcase.'"
1687,1578-6379-0044.flac," the end, said may, unkindly, will be that the baggage-man will deliver the suitcase and german-hillier junior will never know. i may it appeared at the door. if you please, she murmured her amazed eyes on irene, who was still wearing the coat"
1688,1578-140049-0031.flac," and oh, jane on miranda, if you'll only come into the kitchen and look out of the sink window, you can see the banquet lamp shining all red, just as if the simpsons house was on fire. and probably it will be before long, observed miranda. i've got no patience with such foolish goons on."
1689,1578-140049-0035.flac," he needed the soap dreadfully as a present for his aunt. miss jane still looked a little unconvinced, though she only said, i hope your aunt miranda won't mind, but you know how particular she is, rebecca, and i really wish you wouldn't do anything out of the ordinary without asking her first. for your actions are very queer."
1690,1578-140049-0014.flac," and changed the subject much to jane's gratitude for she had been nervous and illidies for the last 15 minutes. what child in riverboro could be described as remarkable in winning, saverebeca? what child had wonderful eyes except the same rebecca?"
1691,1578-140049-0030.flac," it was a heavenly party she cried, taking off her hat and cape. go back and see if you have shut the door tight and then lock at sedmus miranda in her usual austere manner."
1692,1578-140049-0002.flac, can't you set still for once and listen to the improved conversation of your elders?
1693,1578-140049-0026.flac, and oh i'm so glad you both live where you can see it shine from our windows. i wonder how long it will burn without being filled if i only keep it lit one hour every night.
1694,1578-140049-0036.flac," there can't be anything wrong this time, rebecca answered confidently. emma jane sold her cakes to her own relations and to uncle jerry cobb, and i went first to those new tenements near the lumber mill and then to the lads. mr. ladbot all we had and made us promise to keep the secret until the premium came,"
1695,1578-140049-0006.flac," the burnham sisters nodded approvingly as rebecca went out and remarked that they had never seen a child grow and improve so fast and so short of time. there's plenty of room left for more improvement, as you'd know if she lived in the same house with you answered miranda."
1696,1578-140049-0019.flac," we never thought of the expense of keeping up the lamprobeka. no, we didn't. but let's not worry about that till after the party. i have a handful of nuts and raisins and some apples. i have peppermints and maple sugar, said emma jane. they had a real thanksgiving dinner."
1697,1578-140049-0028.flac, it was mr. aladdin whispered rebecca as they ran down the path to the gate. seasaw followed them and handsomely offered to see them of peace down the road. but rebecca declined his escort with such decision that he did not press the matter.
1698,1578-140049-0010.flac," there's hope for him still though,"" said miss jane smilingly, before i don't suppose he's more than 30. he could get a wife and river borough if he was 130 remarked miss miranda. adam zantz says he was so taken with a little girl that sold the soap. clara bell, did you say her name was?"
1699,1578-140049-0012.flac," for this one couldn't have been cross-eyed. i remember mrs. lad saying, adam remarked about this child's handsome eyes. he said it was her eyes that made him buy the 300 cakes. mrs. lad has it stacked up in the shed chamber."
1700,1578-140049-0029.flac," but went to bed to dream of her instead. in his dreams, flashes of lightning proceeded from both her eyes, and she held a flaming sword in either hand. rebecca entered the home dining room joyously. the burnham sisters had gone, and the two aunts were knitting."
1701,1578-140049-0020.flac," the doctor gave them sweet potatoes and cranberries and turnips. father sent a spare rib and mrs. cobb a chicken and a jar of minced meat. at half past five, one might have looked in at the simpsons windows and seen the party at its height."
1702,1578-140049-0032.flac," jane accompanied rebecca into the kitchen. although the feeble glimmer which she was able to see from that distance did not seem to her a dazzling exhibition, she tried to be as enthusiastic as possible. rebecca, who was it?"
1703,1578-140049-0003.flac," what, underc, that canopy did they want of a lamp, and where did they get the money to pay for it? if abner was at home, i should think he'd been swapping again, said miss miranda. the children got it as a prize for selling soap, replied rebecca."
1704,1578-140049-0024.flac," the lamp, it was tacitly felt by everybody, was dignifying the party and providing sufficient entertainment simply by its presence, being fully as satisfactory in its way as a piano la or a string band. i wish father could see it said clara bell loyally."
1705,1578-140049-0011.flac," that he declared he was going to bring her a christmas present continued miss ellen. well, there's no accountant for taste, exclaim miss miranda. clara bell's got cross-size and red hair, but i'd be the last one to graduate her a christmas present."
1706,1578-140049-0004.flac," what have you got in the pocket of that new dress that makes it sag down so? it's my nuts and raisins from dinner replied rebecca, who never succeeded in keeping the most innocent action a secret from her aunt miranda. they're just what you gave me on my plate. why didn't you eat them?"
1707,1578-140049-0015.flac," and finally, was there ever a child in the world who could make a man buy soap by the hundred cakes? save rebecca? meantime, the remarkable child had flown up the road in the deepening dusk, but she had not gone far before she heard the sound of herring footsteps."
1708,1578-140049-0038.flac," there was the sweetness of the mayflower and the strength of the young oak, but one could easily divine that she was one of the souls by nature pitch too high, by suffering plunge too low."
1709,1578-140049-0007.flac, one of the must have said miss ellen burnham.
1710,1578-140049-0017.flac," are selling the 300 cakes corrected rebecca? you did as much as i. no, i didn't. rebecca randall. i just sat at the gate and held the horse. yes, but whose horse was it that took us to north riverboro?"
1711,1578-140049-0005.flac," they were your own rebecca, and reposed aunt jane, and if you chose to save them to give away, it is alright. we ought never to let this day pass without giving our neighbors something to be thankful for, instead of taking all the time to think of our own mercies."
1712,1578-140049-0000.flac," the banquet lamp. there had been company at the brick house to the bountiful thanksgiving dinner which had been provided at one o'clock, the burnham sisters, who lived between north river borough and shaker village and who, for more than a quarter of a century,"
1713,1578-140049-0025.flac," remarked susan sagaciously. at the appointed hour, rebecca dragged herself reluctantly away from the enchanting scene."
1714,1578-140049-0023.flac," in the wide splash of light that flung upon the floor, sat the simpsons in reverent and solemn silence, emma jane standing behind them hand in hand with rebecca. there seemed to be no desire for conversation. the occasion was too thrilling and serious for that."
1715,1578-140049-0001.flac," had come to pass the holiday with the soyers every year. rebecca sat silent with a book after the dinner dishes were washed, and when it was nearly five, asked if she might go to the simpsons."
1716,1578-140049-0013.flac," 300 cakes, ejaculated miranda. well, there's one crop that never fails in riverboro. what's that? ask miss lydia politely. the full crop responded miranda, tursley."
1717,1578-140049-0008.flac," it must have been clara bell, and i should never call her remarkable, answered miss miranda. has adam been home again? yes, he's been staying a few days with his aunt. there's no limit to the money he's making, they say, and he always brings presents for all the neighbors."
1718,1578-140049-0021.flac, mrs. simpson had let the kitchen fire die out and had brought the baby to grace the festal scene.
1719,1578-140049-0009.flac," this time it was a full set of furs for mrs. lad, and to think we can remember the time he was a barefoot boy without two shirts to his back. it is strange he hasn't married, with all his money and him so fond of children that he always has a pack of the middice heels."
1720,1578-140049-0018.flac," but what's the trouble? the simpsons have no carousine and no wicks. i guess they thought a banquet lamp was something that let it itself and burned without any help. seesaw has gone to the doctors to try it if he can borrow a wick, and mother let me have a pint of oil, but she says she won't give me anymore."
1721,1578-140049-0016.flac," and saw a well-known figure coming in her direction. in a moment, she and emma jane met an exchange to breathless embrace. something awful has happened, panted emma jane. don't tell me it's broken, exclaimed rebecca. no! oh, no, not that."
1722,1578-140049-0027.flac," mr. tubbs brought it over from north riverboro and said somebody sent an order by mail for it. rebecca squeezed emma jane's arm, emma jane gave her rapturous return squeeze."
1723,1578-140049-0034.flac," i asked you who sold the soap to adam lad, resumed miss jane. adam lad, then he's a lad, too, what fun! answer me, rebecca. oh, excuse me, aunt j. now it's so busy thinking. emma jane and i sold the soap to mr. lad."
1724,1578-140049-0037.flac," rebecca's hair was loosened and falling over her forehead in ruffled waves. her eyes were brilliant, her cheeks crimson, there was a hint of everything in the girl's face, of sensitiveness and delicacy as well as of art."
1725,1578-140049-0033.flac," that sold the 300 cakes of soap to mr. lad in north riverboro. mr. who exclaimed rebecca mr. lad in north riverboro? is that his real name? queered rebecca in astonishment? i didn't make a bad guess, and she laughed softly to herself."
1726,1578-140049-0022.flac," on it stood the sacred, the adored, the long desired object, almost as beautiful and nearly half as large as the advertisement. the brass glistened like gold and the crimson paper shade glowed like a giant ruby."
1727,1578-140045-0011.flac," she was obliged to confess that she had written nothing. you have at least two lines rebecca insisted the teacher, for i see them on your slate."
1728,1578-140045-0018.flac, does one ever feel bereft when one picks up one's chips to light one's fire for one's evening meal? or when one washes one's milk-pale before milking one's cow? one would fancy not. r-r-r
1729,1578-140045-0002.flac," must be far more beautiful than meltown, which would, she felt, take its proud place among the cities of the earth, by reason of its tremendous business activity rather than by any irresistible appeal to the imagination."
1730,1578-140045-0016.flac," it then appeared in the following form, which hardly satisfied either teacher or pupil. solitude. it would be false to say that one could ever be alone when one has one's lovely thoughts to comfort one."
1731,1578-140045-0013.flac," and the training of the young idea seldom appealed to the sense of humor. he must stay after school and try again, rebecca, as she said, but she said it smilingly. your poetry hasn't a very nice idea in it for a good little girl who ought to love duty."
1732,1578-140045-0015.flac," having been instructed in the use of the indefinite pronoun one as giving a refined and elegant touch to literary efforts, rebecca payne's takingly rewrote her composition on solitude, giving it all the benefit of misdeer-born suggestion."
1733,1578-140045-0020.flac," yes, i don't like a cow in a composition so the difficult misdeerborn."
1734,1578-140045-0027.flac," it was more like praying. well, you've got no call to be praying, any more than swearing in the middle of the road,"" said miranda. but i'm thankful it's no worse. you're born to trouble as the sparks fly upward."
1735,1578-140045-0001.flac," in the matter of mere pictorial beauty. so soon does the soul outgrow its mansions that after once seeing milhtown, her fancy ran out to the future side of portland, for that, having islands and a harbor and two public monuments."
1736,1578-140045-0028.flac," and i'm afraid you always will be till you learn to bridle your unruly tongue. i wish sometimes that i could bridle minis. murmord rebecca, she went to set the table for supper. i declare she is the beateness child, said miranda."
1737,1578-140045-0024.flac, we couldn't keep from laughing after we came out of the tent because they were acting on such a small platform that eliza had to run round and round.
1738,1578-140045-0003.flac," i tell you, harriet beecher stowe herself couldn't have done it better justice. i took it all in, responded mr. cobb, who was pleased that mother agreed with him about rebecca. i ain't sure, but she's going to turn out something remarkable."
1739,1578-140045-0005.flac," or recite pieces like that portland elocutionist that come out here to the harvest supper. i guess she'll be able to write down her own pieces, said mr. cobb, confidently. she can make them up faster and she can read them out of a book."
1740,1578-140045-0021.flac," for the next week, minnie smelly's mother told miranda sawyer that she'd better look after rebecca, for she was given to swearing and profane language, that she had been heard saying something dreadful that very afternoon, saying it before emma jane and living perkins who only laughed."
1741,1578-140045-0007.flac," solitude, but with none of them did rebecca seem to grapple satisfactorily. right as you talk, rebecca, insisted poor miss dearborn, who secretly knew that she could never manage a good composition herself."
1742,1578-140045-0023.flac," emma jane, living an eye, were walking along, and i was ahead. i saw the water streaming over the road towards the ditch, and it reminded me of uncle tom's cabinet, milhtown, when eliza took her baby and ran across the mississippi on the ice blocks, pursued by the bloodhounds."
1743,1578-140045-0025.flac," and part of the time she had to pursue the dog. i knew living would remember too, so i took off my waterproof and wrapped it around my books for a baby."
1744,1578-140045-0014.flac," it wasn't my idea,"" said rebecca apologetically. i had only made the first line when i saw you were going to ring the bell and said the time was up. i had class written and i couldn't think of anything then, but hash or rash or smash. i'll change it to this."
1745,1578-140045-0006.flac," rebecca made a poor hand at composition writing at this time. miss dearborn gave her every sort of subject that she had ever been given herself. cloud pictures, abraham lincoln, nature, philanthropy, slavery, intemperance, joy and duty."
1746,1578-140045-0012.flac," read what you have, good or bad, little or much. i'm excusing nobody. rebecca rose, overcome with secret laughter, dread and mortification. then, in a low voice, she read the couplet."
1747,1578-140045-0017.flac," one sits by one's self, it is true. but one thinks. one opens one's favorite book and reads one's favorite story. one speaks to one's aunt or one's brother. fondles one's cat."
1748,1578-140045-0000.flac," the stirring of the powers. rebecca's visit to milltown was all that her glowing fancy had painted it, except that recent readings about rome and venice disposed her to believe that those cities might have an advantage over milltown."
1749,1578-140045-0010.flac," of recollection. joy and duty had been the inspiring subject given to the older children for a theme to be written in five minutes. rebecca had wrestled, struggled, perspired, and vain, when her turn came to read,"
1750,1578-140045-0019.flac," don't you think calling supper one's evening meal is pretty? and isn't bereft a nice word? yes, that part of it does very well. it is the cat, the chips, and the milkpale that i don't like."
1751,1578-140045-0008.flac, now in your last one on solitude you haven't said anything very interesting and you've made it too common and every day to sound well. there are too many use and yours in it. you want to say one now and then to make it seem more like good writing. one opens a favorite book.
1752,1578-140045-0004.flac," land no mother, there ain't no home path but miss parks. she drives all over the country. i can't see rebecca as a lady doctor somehow, amused mrs. cobb. her gift to gab is what's going to be the making of her."
1753,1578-140045-0029.flac," but whether it's for the better or the worse, i can't hardly tell till she grows up. she's got the making of most anything in her rebecca has, but i feel sometimes as if we were not fitted to cope with her. stuff in nonsense, said miranda."
1754,1578-140045-0026.flac," just like that, the same as eliza did in the play, then i leaped from puddle to puddle, and living in emma jayne pursued me in like the bloodhounds. it's just like that stupid mini-smelly who doesn't know a game when she sees one. and eliza wasn't swearing when she said, my god, the river."
1755,1578-140045-0009.flac," one's thoughts are a great comfort and solitude and so on. i don't know anymore about solitude this week, then i did about joy and duty last week, grumbaldorebeca. you tried to be funny about joy and duty, said miss dearborn, reprovingly. so of course you didn't succeed."
1756,1578-140045-0022.flac," don't be ugly and obstinate, but think real hard. when did they chase you up the road and what were you doing? a sudden light broke upon rebecca's darkness."
1757,7264-92314-0008.flac," if anyone doubts that this agitiv official can properly be applied to our capitalist press today, let him ask himself first what the forces are which govern the nation. and next, whether those forces, the government or regime,"
1758,7264-92314-0000.flac," i say that the few newspaper controllers govern and govern abominably. i am right. but they only do so as do all new powers by at once alliance with and treason against the old. witness, harm's worth and the politicians."
1759,7264-92314-0021.flac," and especially to the one most wealthy and unscrupulous among them, whose wealth is an accident of speculation, whose origins are repulsive, and whose characters have as a rule the weakness and baseness developed by this sort of adventures."
1760,7264-92314-0005.flac," this butocracy, a few wealthy interests, in part controls, in part is expressed by, is in part identical with the professional politicians. it has, in the existing capitalist press, an ally similar to that, official press,"
1761,7264-92314-0019.flac," they have not advanced nearly as far as the discovery of the great newspaper owners in their system. they are still for the most part, duped."
1762,7264-92314-0013.flac," it suppressed for months all reference to that astounding instance of the misdemeanor by the connections of a very prominent professional politician early in the war, and refused to comment on the single reference made to this crime in the house of commons."
1763,7264-92314-0001.flac," this connection has developed in the great capitalist papers a certain character which can be best described by the term official. under certain forms of arbitrary government in continental europe, ministers once made use of picked"
1764,7264-92314-0022.flac," there are among such gutter snipes, thousands whose luck ends in the native gutter, half a dozen whose luck lands them into millions, one or two at most who, on the top of such a career, go crazy with the ambition of the parvanyu and propose to direct the state."
1765,7264-92314-0028.flac," i am not acquainted with any other modern language than french and english, but i read this free press, french, and english colonial and american regularly, and it seems to me the chief intellectual phenomenon of our time."
1766,7264-92314-0030.flac, the new age was i think the pioneer in the matter.
1767,7264-92314-0017.flac, the result is that the mass of englishmen have ceased to obtain or even to expect information upon the way they are governed. they are beginning to feel a certain uneasiness. they know that their old power of observation over public servants has slipped from them.
1768,7264-92314-0027.flac, we're not that such a word would connotes yet a little too much power. though i do believe it's power to be rising. and though i am confident that it will in the near future change our affairs.
1769,7264-92314-0018.flac," they suspect that the known gross corruption of public life, and particularly of the house of commons, is entrenched behind a conspiracy of silence and the part of those very few who have the power to inform them. but as yet, they have not passed the stage of such suspicion."
1770,7264-92314-0006.flac, which continental nations knew in the past. but there is this great difference that the official press of continental experiments never consisted in more than a few chosen organs.
1771,7264-92314-0025.flac," now to every human evil of a political sort that has appeared in history. to every evil that is affecting the state and proceeding from the will of man, not from ungovernable natural forces outside man, there comes a term and a reaction."
1772,7264-92314-0029.flac," in france and in england, and for all i know elsewhere, there has arisen in protest against the complete corruption and falsehood of the great capitalist papers, a crap of new organs, which are in the strictest sense of the word, organs of opinion."
1773,7264-92314-0031.flac," scotland, one or two, their number will increase. with this, i pass from the just denunciation of evil to the exposition of what is good."
1774,7264-92314-0009.flac, could be better served even under a system of permanent censorship than it is in the great dailies of london in the principal provincial capitals. is not everything which the regime desires to be suppressed? is not everything which it desires suggested suggested?
1775,7264-92314-0003.flac, least of all in england. what is grown up here is a press organization of support and favor to the system of professional politics which colors the whole of our great capitalist papers today in england. this gives them so distinct a character of parliamentary falsehood
1776,7264-92314-0012.flac, one paper not a little while ago was clamoring against the excess of lawyers in government. its remedy was an opposition to be headed by a lawyer. another was very serious upon secret trading with the enemy.
1777,7264-92314-0014.flac," another clamors for the elimination of enemy financial power in the affairs of this country, and yet, so's not a word upon the auditing of the secret party funds."
1778,7264-92314-0016.flac," they are not independent where power is concerned. they do not really criticize. they serve a click, whom they should expose, and denounce and betray the generality. that is, the state. for whose sake the salaryed public service should be perpetually watched with suspicion and sharply kept in control."
1779,7264-92314-0007.flac," the character of which was well known. in the attitude of which contrasted sharply with the rest, but our official press for it is no less covers the whole field. it has in the region of the great newspapers no competitor. indeed, it has no competitors at all."
1780,7264-92314-0002.flac," and rare newspapers to express their views. and these newspapers came to be called the official press. it was a crude method and has been long abandoned even by the simpler despotic forms of government. nothing of that kind exists now, of course, in the deeper corruption of modern europe."
1781,7264-92314-0010.flac, and is there any public question which would weaken the regime and the discussion of which is ever allowed to appear in the great capeless journals? there has not been such a case for at least 20 years.
1782,7264-92314-0004.flac, and that falsehood is so clearly dictated by their connection with executive power that they merit the title official. the regime under which we are now living is that of a plutocracy which is gradually replaced the old aristocratic tradition of england.
1783,7264-92314-0024.flac," no shred of responsibility to any organ of the state, they are a deadly peril. the chief of these men are more powerful today than any minister. nay they do, as i have said, and it is now notorious, make and unmake ministers, and they may yet in our worst hour decide the national fate."
1784,7264-92314-0011.flac," never deals with matters vital to its prestige. on the contrary, it deliberately sidetracks any vital discussion that sincere conviction may have forced upon the public, and spoils the scent with false issues."
1785,7264-92314-0023.flac," even when gambling adventures of this sort are known and responsible, as they are in professional politics, their power is a grave danger. possessing, as the newspaper owners do, every power of concealment and at the same time,"
1786,7264-92314-0026.flac," side by side with what i have called the official press in our top heavy plutocracy, there is a risen certain force for which i have difficulty in finding a name, but which i will call for lack of a better name, the free press. i might call it the independent press"
1787,7264-92314-0020.flac," is a very great evil. it warps into pleads public information. it prevents the just criticism of public servants. above all, it gives immense and irresponsible power to a handful of wealthy men"
1788,7264-92314-0015.flac," i say that the big daily papers have now not only those other qualities dangerous to the state which i have described, but that they have become essentially official, that is, insincere and corrupt in their interest in support of the plutocratic complex which, in the decay of aristocracy, governs england."
1789,7264-92310-0021.flac, often quite conscious and direct of advertising power over the press. and this was as i have said not only negative that was long obvious but at last positive.
1790,7264-92310-0023.flac," so far, we see the growth of the press marked by these characteristics. 1. it falls into the hands of a very few rich men and nearly always of men of base origin in capacities. 2. it is, in their hands, a mere commercial enterprise."
1791,7264-92310-0027.flac, the difference being paid by the advertisement subsidy.
1792,7264-92310-0022.flac," both combatants are of a low, cunning, and unintelligent type. minor friction do the same cause as constantly taking place. sometimes the victory falls to the newspaper proprietor, more often to the advertiser, never to the public."
1793,7264-92310-0004.flac," an individual newspaper owner might, for instance, have the greatest possible dislike for the trade in patent medicines. he might object to the swindling of the poor, which is the sole of that trade. he might himself have suffered acute physical pain,"
1794,7264-92310-0025.flac," but the fact that advertisement makes a paper has created a standard of printing and paper such that no one, save at a disastrous loss, can issue regularly to large numbers news and opinion, which the large capitalist advertisers disapprove."
1795,7264-92310-0020.flac," all of which need the suggestion of advertisement. the newspaper owner and the advertiser then were intermixed, but on the balance, the advertising interest being wider spread was the stronger, and what you got was a sort of imposition."
1796,7264-92310-0014.flac," or some such place that the paper was in bad taste. not only was there this negative power in the hands of the advertiser, that of refusing the favor or patronage of his advertisements, there was also a positive one, though that only grew up later."
1797,7264-92310-0007.flac," the proprietor was always at the choice of publishing matter which did not affect him, and saving his fortune or refusing it and jeopardizing his fortune he chose the former course. in the second place there was an even more serious development. advertisement"
1798,7264-92310-0008.flac," having become the standby of the newspaper, the large advertiser"
1799,7264-92310-0000.flac," let us halt at this phase in the development of the thing to consider certain other changes, which were on the point of appearance and why they were on the point of appearance. in the first place, if advertisement had come to be the stand by of a newspaper,"
1800,7264-92310-0006.flac," and fear friction in their own case. he would prefer to retain his income, persuade his readers to buy poison, and remain free personally from touching the stuff he recommended for pay."
1801,7264-92310-0001.flac, the capitalist owning the sheet would necessarily consider his revenue from advertisement before anything else. he was indeed compelled to do so unless he had enormous revenues from other sources and ran his paper as a luxury costing a vast fortune a year.
1802,7264-92310-0031.flac," no policy is attempted until it is ascertained that the newspaper owner is in favor of it. few are profored without first consulting his wishes. many are directly ordered by him. we are, if we talk in terms of real things, as men do when their private councils at westminster"
1803,7264-92310-0013.flac, he was muddled headed about the distinction between a large circulation and a circulation small but appealing to the rich. he would refuse advertisements of luxuries to a paper read by half the wealthier class if he had heard in the national liberal club.
1804,7264-92310-0002.flac," for in this industry, the rule is either very great profits or very great and rapid losses."
1805,7264-92310-0030.flac," it was undrumped about a few years ago. it is already today the capital fact of our whole political system. a prime minister is made or deposed by the owner of a group of newspapers, not by popular vote or by any other form of open authority."
1806,7264-92310-0028.flac," it is the advent of the great newspaper owner as the true governing power in the political machinery of the state superior to the officials in the state, nominating ministers and dismissing them, imposing policies and in general usurping sovereignty"
1807,7264-92310-0026.flac, there would seem to be for any independent press no possible economic basis because the public has been taught to expect for
1808,7264-92310-0011.flac," besides those of mere adverse effect exchange, there are a million half-conscious and subconscious motives at work as well. the large advertisers still mainly paid for advertisement according to circulation."
1809,7264-92310-0009.flac," could not but regard his giving of an advertisement as something of a favor. there is always the psychological or, if you will, artistic element in exchange. in pure economics, exchange is exactly balanced by the respective advantages of the exchanges."
1810,7264-92310-0017.flac, the same man who owned the daily times was a shareholder in jones soap or smith's pills. the man who gambled and lost on the howell was at the same time gambling and winning on a bucket shop advertised in the howell.
1811,7264-92310-0015.flac," the advertiser came to see that he could actually dictate policy and opinion, and that he had also another most powerful and novel weapon in his hand, which was the suppression of news."
1812,7264-92310-0012.flac," he would not advertise in papers which he thought might, by their publication of opinion, ultimately hurt capitalism as a whole. still less, and those whose opinions might affect his own private fortune adversely. stupid, like all people given up to gain,"
1813,7264-92310-0024.flac," 3. it is economically supported by advertisers who can impart control it, but these are of the same capitalist kind, in motive and manner with the owners of the papers. their power does not, therefore, clash in the main with that of the owners."
1814,7264-92310-0032.flac," mainly governed today, not even by the professional politicians, nor even by those who pay them money, but by whatever owner of a newspaper trust is for the moment the most unscrupulous and the most ambitious."
1815,7264-92310-0029.flac, all this secretly and without responsibility. it is the chief political event of our time and is the peculiar mark of this country today. its full development has come on us suddenly and taken us by surprise in the midst of a terrible war.
1816,7264-92310-0016.flac," we must not exaggerate this element. for one thing, the power represented by the great capillus press was a power equal with that of the great advertisers. for another, there was no clear cut distinction between the capitalism that own newspapers and the capitalism that advertised."
1817,7264-92310-0003.flac," where a great daily paper is concerned. he was compelled then to respect his advertisers as his paymasters. to that extent therefore, his power of giving true news and a printing sound opinion was limited, even though his own inclinations should lean towards such news and such opinion."
1818,7264-92310-0018.flac," there was no antagonism of class interest one against the other, and what was more they were of the same kind and breed."
1819,7264-92310-0019.flac, was exactly the same kind of man as he who bought a purge out of a combine in music halls or cut his throat when his bluff in indian silver was called. the type is the common modern type. parliament is full of it and it runs newspapers only as one of its activities.
1820,7264-92310-0010.flac," just as in pure dynamics, you have the parallelogram of forces. in the immense complexity of the real world, material, friction, and a million other things affect the ideal parallelogram of forces. in economics, other conscious passions"
1821,7264-92310-0005.flac," but he certainly could not print an article against him, nor even an article describing how they were made without losing a great part of his income directly and perhaps indirectly the whole of it from the annoyance caused to other advertisers who would note his independence."
1822,7264-92316-0045.flac," but that small number knew very well that we were thus in reality governed by men responsible to no one, and hidden from public blame."
1823,7264-92316-0021.flac," the great dailies were thought gray, not wicked, only general and vague. the free press in its beginnings did not attack as an enemy. it only timidly claimed to be heard. it regarded itself as a speciality. it was humble, and there went with it a massive eccentric stuff."
1824,7264-92316-0015.flac, had captured the whole field. the first propagandist then did not stand up to the official press as equals. they crept in as inferior or rather as open eccentric.
1825,7264-92316-0026.flac," but i know that wherever i get hold of such an organ, it will be very strongly colored with the opinion, or even fanaticism of some minority. the free press as a whole,"
1826,7264-92316-0027.flac," if you edit all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement against another, does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live. the official press today gives you an absurdly false one everywhere."
1827,7264-92316-0042.flac," unfortunately, it could affect only very few men. with the mass even of well-educated and observant men, the feeling created by the novel power of the great papers was little more than a vague ill-ease."
1828,7264-92316-0044.flac," dispose of cabinets, nominate absurd ministers. but the particular vivid concrete instances that especially movement to action were hidden from them. only a small number of people were acquainted with such particular truths."
1829,7264-92316-0007.flac," a generation ago and more, great numbers of men were persuaded that a solution for the whole complex of social injustice was to be found in what they called nationalizing the means of production, distribution, and exchange."
1830,7264-92316-0039.flac," but only a little later than the second motive of indignation against falsehood and acting with equal force, though upon fewer men, was the third motive of freedom of indignation against arbitrary power."
1831,7264-92316-0002.flac, and there was an end of it. great bodies of men who cared intensely for a definite creed found that expression for it was lacking.
1832,7264-92316-0013.flac," these founders of the freepress seem to say, we may convert the mass to our views, but for the moment we are admittedly a click an exceptional body with the penalties attaching to such."
1833,7264-92316-0018.flac," but i now know that these small socialist free papers were talking the plainest common sense when they specifically emphasized as capitalists, the falsehoods and suppression of their great contemporaries."
1834,7264-92316-0043.flac," they had a general conception that the owner of a widely circulated popular newspaper could, and did, blackmailed a professional politician, make or unmake the professional politician by granting or refusing him the limelight."
1835,7264-92316-0009.flac," this creed was held with passionate conviction by men of the highest ability in every country of europe, and a socialist press began to arise, which was everywhere free and soon in active opposition to the official press."
1836,7264-92316-0035.flac," men owning the chief newspapers could be heard boasting of their power in public as an admitted thing, and as this power was recognized and as it grew with time and experiment it spread a reaction."
1837,7264-92316-0029.flac," because it came later than the official press of capitalism, and was in its origins but a reaction against it. b, the second mode of that of indignation against falsehood came to work much later than the mode of a propaganda."
1838,7264-92316-0040.flac," but it is intolerable that similar powers should reside in the hands of obscure nobody's about whom no illusion could possibly exist, whose tyranny is not admitted or public at all, who do not even take the risk of exposing their features, into whom no responsibility whatever attaches."
1839,7264-92316-0017.flac, to papers like the daily telegraph or the times with the epitaph capitalist put after them in brackets. i thought then it was the giving of an abnormal epitaph to a normal thing.
1840,7264-92316-0034.flac," but not a cabinet minister that could not pass an examination in the life, vices, vulnerability, fortune, investments, and favors of the owner. the change was rapidly admitted. it came quickly but thoroughly. at last, like most rapid developments, it exceeded itself."
1841,7264-92316-0037.flac," to lie, the sheer necessity of getting certain truths told, which these powerful but hidden fellows refused to tell, was a force working at high potential in almost compelling the production of free papers side by side with the big official ones."
1842,7264-92316-0010.flac," again, of a religious temper in their segregation, conviction, and enthusiasm, they began to appear when the oppressor was mild, the small papers defending the rights of oppressed nationalities."
1843,7264-92316-0000.flac," the mode of a propaganda, which began to work much the earliest of the three, concerned religions, and also certain racial enthusiasts or political doctrines which, by their sincerity and readiness for sacrifice, had half the force of religions."
1844,7264-92316-0008.flac," that is, of course, in plain english, putting land, houses, and machinery, and stores of food, and clothing into the hands of the politicians for control, and use, and for distribution, and consumption."
1845,7264-92316-0022.flac," if one passes in review, all the free press journals which own their existence in england and france alone to this mode of a propaganda, one finds many side shows as it were beside the main motives of local or race patriotism, religion, or socialist conviction."
1846,7264-92316-0014.flac," they said this although the whole life of france is at least as catholic as the life of great britain is plutocratic, or the life of switzerland democratic. and they said it because they arose after the capitalist press. neutral in religion as an every vital thing."
1847,7264-92316-0032.flac," but it was a sort of dual arrangement which yet modified the power of the vulgar owner. i myself remember the state of affairs, the editor who was a gentleman and dined out, the proprietor who was a lord and nervous when he met a gentleman."
1848,7264-92316-0012.flac," felt no particular animosity against the debuts. for instance, his particular catholic enthusiasm recognized itself as exceptional, and was content to accept the humble or at any rate inferior position which admitted eccentricity canotes. later,"
1849,7264-92316-0020.flac," though, however, certain of the socialist free papers thus boldly took up a standpoint of moral equality with the others. their attitude was exceptional."
1850,7264-92316-0024.flac," we may take it then, the propaganda was, in order of time, the first motive of the free press in the first cause of its production. now from this fact arises a consideration of great importance to our subject."
1851,7264-92316-0011.flac," religion then, in cognane enthusiasm's, were the first breeders of the free press. it is exceedingly important to recognize this because it is stamped the whole movement with a particular character to which i shall later refer when i come to its disabilities."
1852,7264-92316-0019.flac," from the socialist point of view, the leading fact about the insensarity of the great official papers is that this insensarity is capitalist. just as from a catholic point of view, the leading fact about it was and is that it is anti-catholic."
1853,7264-92316-0004.flac," there was nothing to distinguish a large daily paper owned by a jew from one owned by an agnostic or catholic, necessity of expression compelled the creation of a free press in connection with this one mode of religion. men came across very little of this in england."
1854,7264-92316-0023.flac," you have the single-tax papers, you have the t total papers, and really it is one that you have not yet also had the iconic class and the diabolists producing papers. the rationalist and the atheist propaganda are reckoned among the religious."
1855,7264-92316-0003.flac," the organs of opinion professed a gentile ignorance of that idea which was most widespread, most intense and most formative."
1856,7264-92316-0031.flac," there was more than this. for long, the owner of a newspaper head for the most part been content to regard it as a revenue-producing thing. the editor was supreme in matters of culture and opinion. true, the editor being revocable and poor could not pretend to full political power."
1857,7264-92316-0028.flac," no one of them is in any sense general or really national. the free press gives you the truth but only in disjointed sections for it is disparate and it is particularist. it is marked with isolation and it is so marked because it's origin, lay in various and most diverse propaganda."
1858,7264-92316-0005.flac," because england was for long virtually homogeneous in religion, and that religion was not enthusiastic during the years in which the free press arose. but such a free press and defense of religion, the pioneer of all the free press arose in ireland, and in france, and elsewhere."
1859,7264-92316-0001.flac, men found that the great papers in their final phase refused to talk about anything really important in religion. they dared do nothing but repeat very discreetly the vaguest ethical platitudes. they hardly dared do even that. they took for granted a certain invertebrate common opinion.
1860,7264-92316-0030.flac," men gradually came to notice that one thing after another of great public interest, sometimes a vital public interest, was deliberately suppressed in the principal great official papers, and that positive falsehoods were increasingly suggested or stated."
1861,7264-92316-0025.flac, i mean that the free press has had stamped upon it the character of disparate particularism.
1862,7264-92316-0033.flac," the editor became and now is a mere mouthpiece of the proprietor. editors secede each other rapidly. of great papers today, the editor's name of the moment is hardly known."
1863,7264-92316-0016.flac," for victorian england and third empire france falsely proclaimed the representative quality of the official press. to the honor of the socialist movement, the socialist free press was the first to stand up as an equal against the giants."
1864,7264-92316-0036.flac, why should this or that vogueurian men began to say exercise in boast of the power to keep the people ignorant upon matters vital to us all to distort?
1865,7264-92316-0038.flac," that is why you nearly always find the free press directed by men of intelligence and cultivation, of exceptional intelligence and cultivation, and that is where contrasts most with its opponents. see."
1866,7264-92316-0006.flac," but it asserted the necessity of specially emphasizing its particular point of view in its own columns, for religion affects all life."
1867,7264-92316-0041.flac, the knowledge that this was so provided the third and perhaps the most powerful motive for the creation of a free press.
1868,4397-15668-0016.flac," as if attracted by the ringing of their bells. they were growing in a small, nest-like opening between the rock and the bushes, and both the erythronium and the frittalaria were in full flower. these were the first of the species i had seen."
1869,4397-15668-0038.flac," has been transplanted to this wilderness where she blooms alone. the lily of sand pitch. pitch is an old indian, who, i suppose, pitched into the settlers and thus acquired fame enough to give name to the valley."
1870,4397-15668-0032.flac," are two species of zygodanias, fritilaria atroperperia,"
1871,4397-15668-0039.flac," here, i feel uneasy about the name of this lily, for the compositors have a perverse trick of making me say all kinds of absurd things, wholly unwarranted by plain copy, and i fear that the lily of sand pitch will appear in print as the widow of sand patch."
1872,4397-15668-0019.flac," the flycatcher, the walking firm, etc. i hardly know how the little bells i have been describing would be regarded by seekers of this class, but every true flower lover who comes to consider these utah lilies will surely be well rewarded, however long the way."
1873,4397-15668-0024.flac," nature takes the feet and teeth of her flocks into account, and makes use of them to trim and cultivate, and keep them in order, as the bark and buds of the tree are tended by woodpeckers and linets. the every green woods consist as far as i observed of two species."
1874,4397-15668-0028.flac," lying 35 miles to the south was in full side also, and the reverend jordan, which links the two together, maybe traced in silvery gleams throughout its whole course."
1875,4397-15668-0034.flac," for two at hundreds of them owe their lives. during the famine years between 1853 and 1858, great destitution prevailed, especially in the southern settlements, on account of drought and grass-oppers."
1876,4397-15668-0017.flac," and i need not try to tell the joy they made. they were both lowly plants, lowly as violets, the tallest seldom exceeding six inches in height, so that the most searching winds that sweep the mountains scarce reach low enough to shake their bells."
1877,4397-15668-0021.flac," i found hundreds of them in full bloom within two feet of the snow. in winter, only the bulbs are alive, sleeping deep beneath the ground like field mice in their nest. then the snow flowers fall above them, lilies over lilies."
1878,4397-15668-0015.flac," on the upper side, where the bushes were more open. but a company composed of the two lilies i have mentioned were blooming on the lower side, and though they were as yet out of sight, i suddenly changed my mind and went down to meet them."
1879,4397-15668-0036.flac," often curiously freckled like the petals of frittalaria atroperperia. they are fruit rather than flower. good brown bread. but down in the sand-pitch valley at gunnison, i discovered a genuine lily, happily named lily young."
1880,4397-15668-0018.flac," the panels being strongly recurved, like those of lillium superbum. occasionally, a specimen is met, which has from two to five flowers hung in a loose pinnacle. people oftentimes travel far to see curious plants like the carnivorous stalingtonia."
1881,4397-15668-0004.flac," when the ice of the glacial period was laid like a mantle over every mountain in valley, throughout all these immensely protracted periods in the throng of these majestic operations, nature kept her flower children in mind. she considered the lilies."
1882,4397-15668-0010.flac," after carefully scanning the jacket-towers and battlements with which it is roughened, a determined to make it my way, though it presented but a feeble advertisement of its floral wealth. this apparent barrenness, however, made no great objection just then."
1883,4397-15668-0029.flac," the grandest i had carried in many a day. i reached the hotel on the link about dusk with all my fresh riches, and my first mountain ramble in utah was accomplished. on my way back to the city the next day."
1884,4397-15668-0009.flac," i will bathe in the high sky among cool wind waves from the snow. from the more southerly of the two peaks, a long ridge comes down, bent like a bow. one end in the hot plains, the other in the snow the summit."
1885,4397-15668-0026.flac," snowy, ice-cultured ranges bounded the horizon all around, while the great length, 80 miles long and 50 miles wide lay fully revealed beneath the lily sky."

1965,4397-15666-0009.flac," whose smooth linear structure showed that snow was beginning to fall. of these partial storms, there were soon ten or twelve arranged in two rows, while the main jordan valley between them lay as yet in profound calm. at 4.30 pm,"
1966,4397-15666-0007.flac," and their marvelous profusion of ornate sculpture were most impressively manifest. one would fancy that a man might be clearly seen walking on the snow in a distance of 20 or 30 miles. while we were reveling in this rare, unguarish grandeur,"
1967,4397-15666-0006.flac," were marshalling themselves along the mountain tops, and sending out long overlapping wings across the valley. and even where no cloud was visible, an obscuring film absorbed the sunlight, giving rise to a cold, bluish darkness. nevertheless,"
1968,4397-15666-0017.flac," though per chance, they might be sondering by with little else to do than chat with them. possibly there may be salt lake families sufficiently pure for angel society, but i was not pleased with the reception they gave the small snow angels that god sent among them the other night."
1969,4397-15666-0008.flac," turning from range to range, stunning the darkening sky and listening to the still small voices of the flowers at our feet, some of the denser clouds came down, crowning and breathing the highest peaks and dropping long gray fringes."
1970,4397-15666-0011.flac," excited our attention, without enabling us to decide certainly as to its character. but we were not left long and doubt. for in a few minutes, it came sweeping over the valley in a wild uproar, a taunt of wind thick with sand and dust."

1986,298-126791-0026.flac," but i think mr. dunwoody has taken a liberty that exceeds the rights of consanguinity. he has made our father's house a hospital. we ought to be grateful that none of the patients it contains are dearer to us. your brother is one. true, true interrupted francis, blushing to the eyes."
1987,298-126791-0027.flac," but he leaves his room, and thinks his wound lightly purchased by the pleasure of being with his friends, if she added with a tremulous lip. this dreadful suspicion that is affixed to his visit were removed, i could consider his wound a little moment. you now have the fruits of rebellion brought home to you."
1988,298-126791-0052.flac," my sword arm is not in the best condition in roanoke has but a shambling gate this morning. besides, there is another reason i could mention if it were not that miss wharton would never forgive me."
1989,298-126791-0029.flac," her eyes were uniformly fastened on the point where the road was suddenly lost by the intervention of a hill. and at each turn, as she lost sight of the spot she lingered, until an impatient movement of her sister, quickened her pace to an even motion with that of her own."
1990,298-126791-0055.flac," francis withdrew to seek her aunt, musing deeply on the character and extreme sensibility of the new acquaintance chance had brought to the cottage. the wounded officer followed her with his eyes, as she moved, with infantile grace through the door of his apartment, and as she vanished from his view he observed."
1991,298-126791-0020.flac," his case young lady exceeds my art to heal, and i take it, sir henry clinton is the best advisor he can apply to, though major dunwitty has made the communication with his leech rather difficult. francis smiled but averted her face while sarah moved with the grace of an offended juno from the apartment."
1992,298-126791-0035.flac," dr. sittreves supported her from the shades, and when she gained the floor of the piasa, she turned an expressive look on the face of the practitioner. your brother is out of danger and wishes to see you, miss singleton, said the surgeon. the lady burst into a flood of tears."
1993,298-126791-0001.flac, and dr. sitgrieves removed all further apprehensions by confidently pronouncing that he would be a well-man within a fortnight.
1994,298-126791-0063.flac," in short, wharton said the colonel putting one leg out of bed, it may be called a combination of untoward events. your own, ungovernable horse prevented my orders from being carried to the major in season to flank the rebels. very true replied the captain kicking a slipper toward the bed."
1995,298-126791-0022.flac, and possibly dreaming that these little feminine offices were performed for another. her natural bloom was heightened by the insinuation of the surgeon nor was the luster of her eye in any degree diminished. the sound of the approaching footsteps of sit grieves hastened her retreat down a private stairway to the side of her sister.
1996,298-126791-0051.flac," that is a question the major can answer best, but you know the redcoats are abroad, and dunwoody commands in the county, these english must be looked to. true said singleton slowly as if struck with the others reasons, but how is it that you are idle when there is work to do?"
1997,298-126791-0009.flac, his patient smiled as he gently repulsed his physician in an attempt to undo the bandages and with a returning glow to his cheeks inquired.
1998,298-126791-0041.flac," her beautiful eyes sparkled with renovated brilliancy, and her face was lighted with smiles so fascinating that francis, who in compliance with her earnest and treaties, had accompanied her to the sick chamber, set gazing on accountonance that possessed so wonderful variability."
1999,298-126791-0038.flac," and having gained the room where the latter conducted her wept in silence on the shoulder of the observant and soothing girl, until francis thought her tears exceeded the emotion natural to the occasion."
2000,298-126791-0007.flac," softly, my good friend, softly said that you, falling back on his pillow and losing some of that color which alarmed his companion. i believe in extracting the ball you did for me all that is required. i am free from pain and only weak i do assure you."" captain singleton said the surgeon with heat."
2001,298-126791-0033.flac," still, francis could, was difficulty withdraw her true and eyes from the countenance of their visitor. she was young and of a light and fragile form, but of exquisite proportions. her eyes were large, full, black, piercing, and at times a little wild. her hair was luxuriant."
2002,298-126791-0036.flac," francis had stood contemplating the action and face of isabella with the kind of uneasy admiration, but she now sprank to her side with the ardor of a sister and kindly drawing her arm within her own led the way to a retired room."
2003,298-126791-0045.flac," but isabella the meeting has been too much for you. you tremble. isabella made no reply. she stretched her hand toward the table which held the nourishment of the captain, and the attentive francis comprehended her wishes in a moment, a glass of water in some measure revived the sister who was enabled to say."
2004,298-126791-0013.flac," with something of the kind of step you speak of, a very complacent eye, and as to the blue my dare say, offices of charity can summon as fine a color to her cheeks, as glows in the faces of her more youthful nieces. nieces, has she nieces then?"
2005,298-126791-0002.flac, he breakfasted in his own room and notwithstanding certain significant smiles of the man of science.
2006,298-126791-0048.flac," his look was changed to the face of francis, who, startled by the earnestness of his expression, arose, and hastily inquired if he would have any assistance. if you can pardon the rudeness of the wounded officer making a feeble effort to raise his body, i would request to have captain lawton's company for a moment."
2007,298-126791-0058.flac," the entrance of dr. sitgrieves, who, in some alarm, noticed the increase of feverish symptoms in his patient, enforced this mandate, and the trooper withdrew to pay a visit of condolence to rohanook, who had been an equal sufferer with himself in their last night's summer salt."
2008,298-126791-0050.flac," the eye of the sister was now bent on the face of the trooper who made his salutations to the lady with ease, blended with the frankness of a soldier. his man has been here twice, he said, to inquire how we fared in the lezzaretto, and why not himself?"
2009,298-126791-0003.flac," and the latter advanced promptly and laid his fingers on the pulse of the youth, beckoning to him to be silent while he muttered, growing symptoms of a febrile pulse. no, no, my dear george, you must remain quiet and dumb. though your eyes look better and your skin has even a moisture."
2010,298-126791-0016.flac," from all the members of the family when he made his morning entrance, but an invisible spirit presided over the comforts of the english carnal. sarah had shrunk with consciousness from entering the room, yet she knew the position of every glass and had with her own hands, supplied the contents of every bowl that stood on his table."
2011,298-126791-0028.flac," a brother wounded and a prisoner, and perhaps a victim, your father distressed, his privacy interrupted, and not improbably his estate's torn from him on account of his loyalty to his king. francis continued her walk in silence, while facing the northern entrance to the veil,"
2012,298-126791-0021.flac," her own room, however, afforded her but little relief, and in passing through the long gallery that communicated with each of the chambers of the building, she noticed the door of singleton's room to be open. though wounded youth seemed sleeping and was alone."
2013,298-126791-0064.flac," had we succeeded in getting a few good fires upon them in flank, we should have sent these brave virginians to the right about. i and that in double quick time cried the colonel making the other leg follow its companion, then it was necessary to route the guides, you know, and the movement gave them the best possible opportunity to charge."
2014,298-126791-0017.flac," at the time of our tale, we were a divided people, and sarah thought it was no more than her duty to cherish the institutions of that country to which she yet clung us the land of her forefathers. but there were other and more cogent reasons for the silent preference she was giving to the englishman."
2015,298-126791-0039.flac," the sobs of miss singleton for a time were violent and uncontrollable until with an evident exertion she yielded to a kind observation of her companion and succeeded in suppressing her tears. raising her face to the eyes of francis, she rose."
2016,298-126791-0019.flac," conscious interest kept her tongue tied until her sister with the frankness of innocence had put the desired question to dr. sith griefs. colonel wellmeer said the operator gravely is in what i call a state of free will, madame. he is ill or he as well as he pleases."
2017,298-126791-0066.flac," they were repulsed, you saw, and their attempt to drive us from the wood. at least they would have been had they made an attack, said the captain, throwing the rest of his clothes within reach of the carnal."
2018,298-126791-0025.flac, there is but little danger of exceeding the truth.
2019,298-126791-0011.flac," everything is as you left it, but it glided about the room with a grace of a fairy and the tenderness of an angel."
2020,298-126791-0008.flac," it is presumptuous in you to pretend to tell your medical attendant when you are free from pain. if it be not to enable us to decide in such matters of what avail the lights of science, for shame, george, for shame, even that perverse fellow john lotton could not behave with more obstinacy."
2021,298-126791-0053.flac," speak, i beg, without dread of my displeasure,"" said francis, returning the good-humored smile of the trooper with the archness natural to her own sweet face. the odors of your kitchen then cried, lotten bluntly, forbid my quitting the domains until i qualify myself to speak with more certainty concerning the fatness of the land."
2022,298-126791-0060.flac, worders were accordingly given to be in readiness to rejoin the troop at the four corners as soon as his master had shared in the bounty of the approaching banquet.
2023,298-126791-0047.flac," on the march, isabella, eagerly inquired her brother. no, dismounted and seemingly at rest was the reply. the wandering dragoon turned his gaze on the countenance of his sister, who sat with her eye bent on the carpet in unconscious absence, but found no explanation."
2024,298-126791-0054.flac," oh, ah, jeanette is exerting herself to do credit to my father's hospitality, said the laughing girl, and i am a truant from her labors, as i shall be a stranger to her favor unless i proffer my assistance."
2025,298-126791-0065.flac," yes, said the other sending the second slipper after the first, and this major done-witty never overlooks an advantage. i think if we had the thing to do over again continued the colonel raising himself on his feet, we might alter the case very materially, though the chief thing the rebels have now to boast of is my capture."
2026,298-126791-0005.flac," the tongue is well, and the pulse begins to lower again. ah, the bleeding did you good. flabbotomy is a sovereign specific for southern constitutions."
2027,298-126791-0061.flac, and by his sympathy succeeded in restoring the kernel to his own good graces.
2028,298-126791-0049.flac," francis hastened instantly to communicate his wish to that gentleman, and impelled by an interest she could not control, she returned again to her seat by the side of miss singleton. lotton said the youth impatiently as the trooper entered. hear you from the major."
2029,298-126791-0040.flac," more composed than her previous agitation had given reason to expect. isabella found her brother looking better and in less danger than her sensitive imagination had led her to suppose. her spirits rose in proportion, from despondency she passed to something like gayity."
2030,298-126791-0004.flac," name my dear sit-greaves, said the youth, taking his hand. you see there is no fever about me. look, is there any of jack lotton's whore-fost on my tongue? no indeed, said the surgeon, clapping a spoon in the mouth of the other, forcing it open and looking down his throat as if disposed to visit the interior in person."
2031,298-126791-0042.flac," impelled by a charm that was beyond her control. the youth had thrown an earnest look at francis, as soon as his sister raised herself from his arms, and perhaps it was the first glance at the lovely linearments of our heroine,"
2032,298-126791-0043.flac," when the gayser turned his eyes from the view and disappointment, he seemed to be wildered, rubbed his forehead like a man awakeing from a dream and mused. where is dunwoody, isabella, he said? the excellent fellow is never weary of kind actions. after a day of such services that if yesterday,"
2033,298-126791-0014.flac," the angel i saw may be a daughter, a sister, or a niece, but never an own. hush, george hush, you're talking has brought your pulse up again. you must observe quiet and prepare for a meeting with your own sister who will be here within an hour. what is abela and who's sent for her?"
2034,298-126791-0067.flac," true, true cried the colonel with animation, had i been there to have improved that advantage we might have turned the table on the yankees, saying which he displayed still greater animation in completing his toilet, and he was soon prepared to make his appearance fully restored to his own good opinion and fairly persuaded that his capture was owing to casualties absolutely beyond the control of man."
2035,298-126791-0023.flac," the sisters then sought the fresh air on the piaza, and as they pursued their walk, armin armed the following dialogue took place. there is something disagreeable about this surgeon of dunwoody said sarah that causes me to wish him away, most heartily."
2036,298-126791-0018.flac," it is true he wanted the personal excellence of peyton dunwoody, but his pretensions were far from contemptible. sarah had moved about the house during the morning, casting frequent and longing glances at the door of wellmeer's apartment, anxious to learn the condition of his wounds and yet ashamed to inquire."
2037,298-126791-0030.flac," at length, a single horse-shade was seen making it to my carefully among the stones which lay scattered over the country road that wound through the valley and approached the cottage."
2038,298-126791-0056.flac," a good motherly lady but as to love that is a matter of taste, a few years younger with deference to her prudence and experience would accord better with my fancy. she must be under twenty, said the other quickly. it depends on the way you count. if you begin at the heel of life, well,"
2039,298-126791-0034.flac," and as it was without the powder, it was then the fashion to wear. it fell in raven blackness. a few of its locks had fallen on her cheek, giving its chilling whiteness by the contrast and more deadly character."
2040,298-126791-0046.flac," doubtless, it is his duty, to as set above a royal party was moving on the river, though i passed the troops but two miles from this spot. the latter part of the sentence was hardly audible, and it was spoken more in the manner of a soliloquy than as if for the ears of her companions."
2041,298-126791-0012.flac," as he inquired with a brevity that would have honored lieutenant mason, had it petty-coats, george. i saw nothing but its heavenly eyes, its bloom, its majestic step, its grace, replied the young man, with rather more ardor than his surgeon thought consistent with his debilitated condition."
2042,298-126791-0037.flac, the feeling was communicated to all the spectators and they dispersed in pursuit of their usual applications. isabella yielded to the gentle influence of francis without resistance.
2043,298-126791-0062.flac," warton knew that their misfortune, as they both termed their defeat, was owing to the others' rationalness, but he forebore to speak of anything except the unfortunate accident which had deprived the english of their leader, and to which he, good naturely, ascribed their subsequent discomforture."
2044,298-126791-0031.flac," the color of france has changed as the vehicle gradually drew nearer, and when she was enabled to see a female form in it by the side of a black and livery, her limbs shook with an agitation that compelled her to lean on sarah for support. in a few minutes, the travelers approached the gate."
2045,298-126791-0015.flac," the major. consider it done, woody murmured the exhausted youth, sinking again on his pillow where the commands of his attendant compelled him to remain silent. even captain lotton had been received with many and courteous inquiries after the state of his health."
2046,298-126791-0000.flac," the morning found them all restored, in some measure, to their former ease of body, with the exception of the youthful captain of dragoons, who had been so deeply regretted by dunwoody. the wound of this officer was severe, though the surgeon persevered in saying that it was without danger."
2047,298-126790-0017.flac," but then i have left my wages for three years past in the hands of harvey, and how might to get them. my brothers told me again and again to ask for my money, but i always thought accounts between relations were easily settled. were you related then to birch, asked miss peyton observing her to pause?"
2048,298-126790-0021.flac," the surgeon drew up and employed himself in whistling the low air, as he looked over some vials on a table, but the housekeeper, turning to him with an inclination of the head continued. i suppose, sir, a woman has no dower in her husband's property unless they be actually married."
2049,298-126790-0027.flac," but i suppose his time had come, and when that happens it matters but little what doctors stuff we take. let me set you right in that particular interrupted disurgeon. we must all die, it is true, but it is permitted us to use the lights of science in arresting dangers as they occur until..."
2050,298-126790-0015.flac," replied. to his troubles of the times and the loss of property that brought him down, he wasted from day to day and all my care and anxiety were lost. for now harvey is no better than a beggar and who is there to pay me for what i have done."""
2051,298-126790-0034.flac," for my part, i am clear for doctoring, though harvey says i am killing myself with medicines."
2052,298-126790-0005.flac, startled the fruitant surgeon and warned him of a trite saying in the corps that captain lawton always slept with one eye open. this group had assembled in one of the parlors as the sun made its appearance over the eastern hill dispersing the columns of fog which had enveloped the lowland.
2053,298-126790-0037.flac, and as such was highly pleased with what he said.
2054,298-126790-0016.flac," god will reward you for all the good you have done, said miss peyton mildly. yes, interrupted the spencer hastily and with an error of reverence that was instantly succeeded by an expression that denoted more of worldly care."
2055,298-126790-0009.flac," katie, is he gone? no maim replied the disturbed damsel with great bitterness. he is not yet gone, but he may go as soon as he pleases now for the worst is done."
2056,298-126790-0022.flac," it was a maxim with dr. sitgrief's that no species of knowledge was to be despised, and consequently he was an empiric in everything but his profession. at first, indignation at the irony of his comrade kept him silent, but suddenly, changing his purpose,"
2057,298-126790-0010.flac," and those he has on are none of the best i can tell you. how exclaimed the other astonished could anyone have the heart to plunder a man in such distress? hearts repeated katie catching her breath, men like them have no bowels at all, plunder and distress indeed."
2058,298-126790-0029.flac," who administered to the case. no one yet said the housekeeper with quickness, i expect he has made his last will in testament. the surgeon disregarded the smile of the ladies and pursued his inquiries. it is dealtless wise to be prepared for death, but under whose care was the sick man during his indisposition?"
2059,298-126790-0035.flac," therein, you show your sense,"" said the surgeon approaching the spencer, who sat holding the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet to the genial heat of a fine fire, making the most of comfort amid all her troubles."
2060,298-126790-0001.flac, but frequently through a dread of future depredations from the commiseration of their neighbors also. additional duties had drawn the ladies from their pillows at an hour somewhat earlier than usual and captain lawton
2061,298-126790-0039.flac," in the absence of more enlightened counselors, the experience of a discrete matron is frequently of great efficacy in checking the progress of disease. under such circumstances, madame, it is dreadful to have to contend with ignorance and obstinacy."
2062,298-126790-0019.flac," piercing eyes lowering at her through his thick brows in silence. perhaps this gentleman knows he seems to take an interest in my story. madam said the trooper bowing very low, both you and the tailor extremely interesting. katie smiled involuntarily."
2063,298-126790-0026.flac, and fearful the conversation would cease he inquired with an appearance of great interest. you think it was age and debilitty that removed the old gentleman at last? and the trouble sometimes trouble as a heavy pull down to a sick bed
2064,298-126790-0043.flac," i tell harvey his conduct is often condemnable, and last night he made my words good. but the opinions of such unbelievers is not very consequential. yet it is dreadful to think how he behaves at times. now when he threw away the needle."
2065,298-126790-0008.flac," that seemed so overwhelming. a near-review of the disturbed features of the visitor confirmed miss payton in her belief, and with the shock that gentle feelings ever experienced at a sudden and endless separation from even the meanest of their associates, she said hastily."
2066,298-126790-0012.flac," besides, what might have been in the deer skin purse. but harvey is little better now than a beggar, and a beggar misjeanette is the most awfully despizable of all earthly creatures."
2067,298-126790-0033.flac," dr. sitgreaves does not mean a regular soldier but a regular physician madame said the trooper. oh, cred made in, again correcting herself. for the best of all reasons, there was none to be had, so i took care of him myself."
2068,298-126790-0011.flac," why, ma'am, there were in the iron pot in plain sight. fifty-four guineas of gold, besides what lay underneath, which i couldn't count without handling, and i didn't like to touch it for— they say that another's gold is after stick, so judging from that insight, there wasn't less than two hundred guineas."
2069,298-126790-0041.flac," indeed, i can easily comprehend the mortification you must have felt in having one so self-willed to deal with returns the surgeon glancing his eyes reproachfully at his comrade. but you should rise superior to such opinions and pity the ignorance by which they are engendered."
2070,298-126790-0002.flac," notwithstanding the sufferings of his body had risen in compliance with a rule from which he never departed, of sleeping but six hours at a time. this was one of the few points in which the care of the human frame was involved, on which the trooper and the surgeon of horse were ever known to agree."
2071,298-126790-0042.flac," the housekeeper hesitated a moment at a loss to comprehend all that the surgeon expressed. yet she felt it was both complementary and kind. therefore suppressing her natural flow of language a little, she replied."
2072,298-126790-0040.flac, harvey is as obstinate about such things as a dumb beast. one would think the care i took of his bedridden father might learn him better than to despise good nursing. but someday he may know what it is to want a careful woman in his house. though now i'm sure he is too despizable himself to have a house.
2073,298-126790-0020.flac," but my humble knowledge is limited to the setting of a squadron in the field and using it when there. i beg leave to refer you to dr. aschibal's sit-creves, a gentleman of universal attainments and unbounded philanthropy, the very milk of human sympathies and immortal foe to all indiscriminate cutting."
2074,298-126790-0024.flac," to this part of his speech then she directed her reply. i did think he only waited the death of the old gentleman before he married, said the housekeeper, looking on the carpet. but now he is nothing more than despisable or what's the same thing, a peddler without house-pack or money."
2075,298-126790-0032.flac," i'm sure harvey has suffered enough already from having so much concerns with the regulars replied the housekeeper. he has lost his all and made himself a vagabond through the land, and i have reason to rue the day i ever crossed the threshold of his house."
2076,298-126790-0031.flac," i doctored him mostly with yorbs said the housekeeper smiling as if conscious of error. with symbols returns the surgeon. they are safer in the hands of the unlettered, than more powerful remedies, but why had you no regular attendant?"
2077,298-126790-0007.flac," and was seen making hasty steps towards the locusts. there was that in the air of the housekeeper which bespoke to stress of an unusual nature, and the kindhearted mistress of the locusts opened the door of the room, with the benevolent intention of soothing a griefed,"
2078,298-126790-0044.flac," what said the surgeon interrupting her does he affect to despise the needle, but it is my lot to meet with men daily who are equally perverse and who show a still more culpable disrespect for the information that flows from the lights of science."
2079,298-126790-0025.flac," it might be hard for a man to get a wife at all in such a predicaried, don't you think it would miss peyton? i seldom trouble myself with such things, said the lady gravely. during this dialogue, captain lawton had been studying the countenance and manner of the housekeeper with the most ludicrous gravity."
2080,298-126790-0004.flac," tolerated the interruptions with a very ill grace, and once, for an instant, he ventured to steal softly to the bed of his obstinate comrade and was near succeeding in obtaining a touch of his pulse, when a terrible oath sworn by the trooper in a dream"
2081,298-126790-0014.flac," he died about two hours and ten minutes before the cock crowed as near as we can say. she was interrupted by the physician who, approaching, inquired with much interest, the nature of the disorder. glancing her eye over the figure of this new acquaintance, katie instinctively adjusted her dress."
2082,298-126790-0006.flac," miss peyton was looking from a window in the direction of the tenement of the peddler, and was expressing a kind anxiety after the welfare of the sick man, when the person of katie suddenly emerged from the dense covering of an earthly cloud, whose mists were scattering before the cheering rays of the sun."
2083,298-126790-0023.flac," he answered the applicant with a good-natured smile. i judge not. if death has anticipated your nut shells, i'm fearful you have no remedy against his stern decrease. decaydie this sounded well, although she understood nothing of its meaning but death and nut shells."
2084,298-126790-0030.flac," under mine answered katie with an error of a little importance, and kair thrown away, i may well call it, for harvey is quite too despisable to be any sort of compensation at present. the mutual ignorance of each other's meaning made very little interruption to the dialogue,"
2085,298-126790-0028.flac," we can die secundum artim cried the trooper. to this observation, the physician did not dame to reply, but deeming it necessary to his professional dignity that the conversation should continue he added, perhaps in this instance, judicial treatment might have prolonged the life of the patient."
2086,298-126790-0018.flac," why, who return to the housekeeper, has a tating a little? i thought we were as good as so. i wonder if i have no claim on the house in garden, though they say, now it is harvey's, it will surely be confiscated. turning to lawton, who had been sitting in one posture with his"
2087,298-126790-0036.flac," you appear to be a sensible discrete woman, and some who have had opportunities of acquiring more correct views might envy you your respect for knowledge and the lights of science. although the housekeeper did not altogether comprehend the others' meaning she knew he used to compliment."
2088,298-126790-0013.flac," the countenance of katie changed from the natural expression of concern to the set form of melancholy, as she answered. he is happily removed from the cares of the world. the chinking of the money made him get out of his bed, and the poor soul found the shock too great for him."
2089,298-126790-0003.flac," the doctor had watched during the night by the side of the bed of captain singleton, without once closing his eyes. occasionally, he would pay a visit to the wounded englishman, who, being more hurt in the spirit than in the flesh,"
2090,298-126790-0038.flac," it was always said of me that i wanted nothing but opportunity to make quite a physician myself, so long as before i came to live with harvey's father they called me the pettycoat doctor. more true than civil, i dare say returned to the surgeon losing sight of the woman's character in his admiration of her respect for the healing art."
2091,298-126790-0000.flac," the family at the locusts had slept or watched through all the disturbances at the cottage of birch, in perfect ignorance of their occurrence. the attacks of the skinners were always made with so much privacy as to exclude the sufferers"
2092,2289-152258-0016.flac," in a cave on mount hira near mecca. he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious meditation. he declared that while praying in his cave, he often had visions of god in heaven."
2093,2289-152258-0018.flac," this book is called the kran, which means, like our own word bible, the book."
2094,2289-152258-0008.flac," this woman was a widow, who was carrying on the business left her by her husband. as soon as the camel driver saw muhammad, he stopped him and said, my mistress wishes to see you before noon. i think she intends to engage you to take charge of her caravans."

2220,2289-152257-0000.flac," in the time of clovis, the country now called bulgaria wasn't inhabited by goths. one day a poor shepherd boy, about sixteen years of age, left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of constantinople, which was many miles away."
2221,2289-152257-0020.flac," laid siege to the city, thinking that he would compel the romans to surrender. but instead of having any thought of surrender, belisarius was preparing his men for fight. and when they were ready, he attacked videgas and defeated him."
2222,1081-125237-0056.flac, trump succeeded by expert seamanship in holding off the enemy and conducting his convoy with small loss into safety.
2223,1081-125237-0042.flac," all of them being captured or burnt, while blake with the main force of the north coast of scotland destroyed the dutch fishing fleet and their convoy. after these first blows against the enemy's commerce, good fortune continued to attend the english."
2224,1081-125237-0091.flac," the treaty ratified and signed, was sent back to london. only one article aroused opposition."
2225,1081-125237-0105.flac," all the secret instructions they had received from holland and the act of exclusion. meanwhile, the estates of holland themselves, frightened of the clamor which had been aroused, began to show signs of defection."
2226,1081-125237-0032.flac, but popular feeling on both sides was now aroused.
2227,1081-125237-0034.flac," all of the advantages were on the side of their enemies. the dutch merchant fleets covered the seas, and the welfare of the land depended on commerce. the english had little to lose commercially."
2228,1081-125237-0065.flac," and their insistence now on the full satisfaction of all the english demands made a continuation of hostilities inevitable. cromp, after successfully bringing the two large convoys of merchantmen, encountered june 12th,"
2229,1081-125237-0036.flac," it had been largely increased by the parliament after 1648, and its generals, blake, penn, and asquue had already acquired much valuable experience in their encounters with the royal squadron under prince rupert."
2230,1081-125237-0025.flac, who in pursuance of economy had reduced the fleet to 75 ships. it was resolved therefore on february 22nd.
2231,1081-125237-0050.flac, but they were deceived in thinking that the struggle in the channel was over for the winter. the deserters at the kentish nakh were punished.
2232,1081-125237-0097.flac," to the active exclusion came upon the estates like a thunderbolt. the sudden demand caused something like consternation, and the members asked to be allowed to consider the matter with their principles before taking so momentous a decision. three days were granted."
2233,1081-125237-0068.flac," the english now instituted a blockade of the dutch coast, which had the effect of reducing to desperate straits, a land whose welfare and prosperity depended wholly on commerce. amsterdam was ruined. in these circumstances, direct negotiation was perforce attempted."
2234,1081-125237-0083.flac," not till the dutch envoys had demanded their passports, did the protector give way so far as to say he would be content to have the exclusion guaranteed by a secret article. what followed forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of diplomacy."
2235,1081-125237-0026.flac," the council of state, on hearing of this, began also to make ready for eventualities. negotiations were still proceeding between the two countries, when martin trump, the victor of the battle of the downs,"
2236,1081-125237-0080.flac," was perfectly aware that it would be useless to present such proposals to the state's general. not only would they indignantly reject them, but he had not the slightest hope of getting any single province, even holland, to allow a foreign power to interfere with their internal affairs."
2237,1081-125237-0102.flac," but for some five weeks the existence of the act was unknown to the state's general. and during that period,"
2238,1081-125237-0059.flac, destroyed a british squadron off leghorn march 23rd. in both countries there was a peace party.
2239,1081-125237-0041.flac," he left asque with a small squadron to guard the mouth of the thames. trump, meanwhile, had put to sea at the head of nearly a hundred ships. asque succeeded in intercepting a fleet of dutch merchantmen near kelle."
2240,1081-125237-0022.flac, they further demanded that the dutch commanders should acknowledge england's sovereignty by striking flag and sail and by firing a salute whenever any of their squadrons met english ships in the narrow seas. it was these last two questions.
2241,1081-125237-0051.flac," full of resentment though he was at the bad treatment he had received, trump was too good a patriot to refuse. at the end of november, the old admiral at the head of 100 warships put to see for the purpose of conveying some 450 merchant men through the straits."
2242,1081-125237-0104.flac," all the other provinces strongly protested against the action of the estates of holland and of the council pensionary. to wit attempted to defend himself and the estates by vague statements, avoiding the main issue, but insisting that nothing illegal had been done. his efforts were in vain."
2243,1081-125237-0035.flac, was superior in almost all other respects. the stewards had devoted great attention to the fleet and would have done more but for lack of means. charles much abused ship money was employed by him for the creation of the first english professional navy.
2244,1081-125237-0081.flac, and to bid them to treat with harshing gratitude the infant heir of a family to which the dutch people owed so deep a debt. there was nothing for it but to prepare for a vigorous resumption of the war. strong efforts were therefore made at the witts' instigation.
2245,1081-125237-0040.flac," early in july 1652, blake at the head of sixty ships set sail for the north to intercept the dutch baltic commerce and to destroy their fishing fleet off the north of scotland."
2246,1081-125237-0048.flac," and as the orange partisans were everywhere clamorously active, the admiral was suspect. in his place, cornelis whitted the whitt was appointed, a capable sailor, but disliked in the fleet as much as trump was beloved. the whitt affected the junction with the reuter,"
2247,1081-125237-0098.flac," but as it was essential to prevent publicity, it was settled that only the bergamaster should be consulted, again under oath of secrecy. at the meeting on may 1st,"
2248,1081-125237-0111.flac," and the risk of a renewal of the war. no further action was taken, and the protector professed himself satisfied with a guarantee of such doubtful validity. it is impossible to withhold admiration from to its marvelous diplomatic dexterity."
2249,1081-125237-0112.flac," and from the skill and courage with which he achieved his end in the face of obstacles and difficulties that seemed insurmountable. but for the course of double dealing in shakenery by which he triumphed, the only defense that can be offered is that the council pensionary"
2250,1081-125237-0037.flac," and in long cruises to the west indies for the purpose of forcing the english colonies to acknowledge parliamentary rule. the crews, therefore, were well-trained, and the ships were larger, stronger, and better armed than those of the dutch."
2251,1081-125237-0069.flac," for unvoiced were sent representing the three maritime provinces. at first it seemed impossible that any common ground of agreement could be found. cromwell was obsessed with the idea of a political religious union between the two republics, which would have meant the extinction of the dutch independence."
2252,1081-125237-0074.flac," the states, though much perplexed, to find a successor to martin trump, were so far from being discouraged that great energy was shown in reorganizing the fleet."
2253,1081-125237-0079.flac, article 12 stipulated that the prince of orange should not at any time hold any of the offices or dignities which had been held by his ancestors or be appointed to any military command.
2254,1081-125237-0029.flac," trump declared that he had given orders to strike the flag, but that blake again fired, before there was time to carry them out. be this as it may, the two fleets were soon engaged in a regular fight, and the english being reinforced, trump withdrew at nightfall,"
2255,1081-125237-0060.flac," and was averse to war. in the dutch republic, the state's party, especially in holland, the chief sufferer by the war, was anxious for a cessation of hostilities. and it found its leader in the youth for john de witt."
2256,1081-125237-0088.flac, the council pensionary first set to work to have the treaty from which the exclusion article had been cut out ratified rapidly by the state's general.
2257,1081-125237-0101.flac," and overrule their protest. the actors declared to have been passed, and was, on may 5th, sent van bervinga and newport, with instructions not to deliver it until circumstances compelled them to do so."
2258,1081-125237-0021.flac," the english government, however, meant the dutch complaints by raking up the long list of grievances that had stirred up a bitter feeling of popular hatred against the united provinces in england and by demanding reparation."
2259,1081-125237-0090.flac," and such was his persuasive skill that he accomplished the unprecedented feat of getting this de-liatory body to accept the conditions of peace, almost without discussion."
2260,1081-125237-0043.flac," trump was prevented from following blake by strong, northerly winds. he then turned upon asque, whose small force he must have overwhelmed, but for a sudden change to a southerly gale. the dutch admiral now sailed northwards and, july 25th."
2261,1081-125237-0044.flac," found the english fleet off the shetlands. a violent storm arose from the force of which blake was protected, while the dutch vessels were scattered far and wide. on the following day, out of 99 ships, trump could only collect 35."
2262,1081-125237-0093.flac, or commander of military or naval forces.
2263,1081-125237-0075.flac," meanwhile, negotiations had been slowly dragging on. the ascension of cromwell to supreme power in december, 1653, with the title of lord protector"
2264,1081-125237-0103.flac," early in june, a bribe induced one of dewitt's clerks to betray the secret to count william frederick. the news soon spread and loud was the outcry of the orange partisans and of the two princesses who at once addressed a remonstrance to the state's general."
2265,1081-125237-0057.flac," meanwhile, both nations had been getting sick of the war. the dutch were suffering terribly from the series' interference with their commerce and carrying trade and from the destruction of the important fisheries industry."
2266,1081-125237-0110.flac," while the clerk was laboriously deciphering the dispatch, the envoys read between the lines of duits letter, and without a moment's delay went to whitehall and placed the acting cromwell's hands. the state's general had thus no alternative between acceptance of the fate to complete"
2267,1081-125237-0089.flac," the estates adjourned for recess on april 21, 1654. on the following day, he presented the treaty to the states general."
2268,1081-125237-0071.flac," but in order to gain breathing space for the efforts of the negotiators, one thing was essential, the breaking of the blockade. the admiraltees made a supreme effort to refit and reinforce their fleet, but it lay in two portions, 85 sale under trump in the mass."
2269,1081-125237-0100.flac," dewitt succeeded after an angry debate in securing a majority for the act. five towns, however, obstinately refused their assent and claimed that it could not be passed without it. but dewitt had made up his mind to risk illegality."
2270,1081-125237-0049.flac," and with joint forces they attacked blake on october 8, near the shawl known as the kentish knock. the english fleet was considerably more powerful in the dutch, and the disursion of de witt by some twenty ships decided the issue. the dutch had to return home with some loss."
2271,1081-125237-0077.flac," at last, cromwell formulated his proposals in 27 articles. the demands were those of the victor and were severe. all the old disputes were to be settled in favour of england. an annual sum was to be paid for the right of fishing."
2272,1081-125237-0067.flac," trump was obliged to retreat, having lost twenty ships. he complained bitterly, as did his vice-admiral's deraute and the wit, to the board of admiralty of the inferiority of the vessels of his fleet, as compared with those of the adversary."
2273,1081-125237-0038.flac," the position of england, lying as it did, a thwart the roots by which the dutch merchant fleets must sail, was a great advantage. even more important was the advantage of having a central control."
2274,1081-125237-0031.flac," adrian powell himself left hastily for london, yonder whit being appointed to act as his deputy during his absence. powell's strenuous efforts, however, to maintain peace were all in vain, despite the strong leanings of cromwell towards a peaceful solution."
2275,1081-125237-0047.flac," the ill-success of trump, though he was in no way to blame for it, caused considerable alarm and discontent in holland. his enemies of the state's party in that province took advantage of it to suspend the gallantol semen from his command. he was an orangish."
2276,1081-125237-0095.flac, the cleverness and skill now shown by the council pensionary were truly extraordinary. a summons was sent out to the estates to meet on april 28 without any reason being assigned. the members on assembly were sworn to secrecy.
2277,1081-125237-0045.flac, and to meet and convoy back the homecoming ships.
2278,1081-125237-0092.flac," the so-called temperament clause, but cromwell had insisted upon it. by this article,"
2279,1081-125237-0082.flac," to increase the fleet and secure the active cooperation of denmark and france, both friendly to the states. but cromwell really wanted peace and showed himself ready to yield on certain minor points, but he continued to insist on the exclusion of the prince of orange."
2280,1081-125237-0108.flac," this was agreed to, and on june 7th, the document was duly forwarded to london by the council pensionary."
2281,1081-125237-0114.flac," there is, however, every reason to believe that the wit was prompted to take the risks he did by purely patriotic motives, and not through spite against the house of orange."
2282,1081-125237-0024.flac," not merely by privateers, but by an english squadron under ice-cue in the west indies, had caused intense indignation and alarm in holland, and especially in amsterdam. pressure was bought to bear on the state's general and the admiraltees."
2283,1081-125237-0084.flac," he was able to reach the private ear of cromwell, and to enter into clandesta in negotiations with him. the council pensionary knew well the hopelessness of any attempt to get the ascent of the state's general to the proposed exclusion, even in a secret article."
2284,1081-125237-0073.flac, the old hero fell mortally wounded at the very beginning of what proved to be an unequal fight.
2285,1081-125237-0096.flac, and then the official letter from london was read to them.
2286,1081-125237-0053.flac," while many english prizes were captured. this state of things was, however, not to last long. towards the end of february 1653, blake put to sea with nearly 80 ships, and on the 25th of portland, met trump at the head of a force nearly equal to his own in number."
2287,1081-125237-0066.flac," near the gabbard, the english fleet under monk and dean. each fleet numbered about 100 sail, but the dutch ships were inferior in size, solidity, and weight of metal. for two days, the fight was obstinately and fiercely contested."
2288,1081-125237-0030.flac," to the french coast having lost two ships. great was the anger aroused in england, where the dutch were universally regarded as the aggressors. in the netherlands, where the peace party was strong, many were disposed to blame trump despite his protests."
2289,1081-125237-0070.flac," una republica, which nothing but sheer conquest and dire necessity would ever induce the dutch people to accept. accordingly, the war went on, though the envoys did not leave london, hoping still that some better terms might be offered."
2290,1081-125237-0085.flac," of the state of public feeling on this point, with the result that the protector gave the own boy to understand that he would be satisfied if the estates of holland alone would affirm a declaration that the prince should never be appointed stetholder or captain general. whether this concession was offered by cromwell proprio motu"
2291,1081-125237-0055.flac," had lasted for two whole days, when trump found that his powder had run out, and that on the third day more than half his fleet were unable to continue the struggle. but inspiring his subordinates, deroiter evertson and flurasun, with his own indomitable courage,"
2292,1081-125237-0020.flac," who, having been given letters of mark to pray upon french commerce,"
2293,1081-125237-0052.flac," stormy weather compelled him to send the convoy with an escort into shelter, but he himself with sixty ships set out to seek the english fleet which lay in the downs. after some maneuvering, the two fleets met on december 10th of dungeoness."
2294,1081-125237-0107.flac," his efforts to prevent the resolution of the state's general from taking immediate effect, proving unavailing. he put forward the suggestion that on the account of its importance, the dispatch should be sent to the envoys in cypher."
2295,1081-125237-0028.flac," it came suddenly through a misunderstanding. the dutch admiral, while cruising past dover, met on may 29, 15 english ships under blake."
2296,1081-125237-0086.flac," in any case, the council pensionary, being convinced of the necessity of peace, resolved to secure it by playing a very deep and dangerous game. not only must the whole affair be kept absolutely from the cognizance of the state's general,"
2297,1081-125237-0062.flac, thus early did the new council pensionary initiate a form of diplomacy in which he was to prove himself and adapt. this first effort was not a success. the parliament published the letter with the title humboldt's application of the states of holland.
2298,1081-125237-0106.flac, they went so far as to pass a vote of thanks to the envoys for not having delivered the act cromwell. to which position appeared hopeless?
2299,1081-125237-0033.flac," if humiliating terms were submitted to, stiffened their attitude. the result was that the unvoys left london on june 30th, 1652, and war was declared. the dutch statesmen who sought to avoid hostilities were right."
2300,1081-125237-0027.flac," now lieutenant admiral of holland was sent to see with fifty ships and instructions to protect dutch merchantmen from interference, and to see that the state suffered no affront. nothing was actually said about the striking of the flag."
2301,1081-125237-0061.flac, had been appointed council pensionary. cromwell took pains to let the estate to fallen know his favorable feelings towards them by sending over in february a private emissary.
2302,1081-125237-0078.flac, compensation to be made for the massacre of amboina and the officials responsible for it punished. a number of warships in english waters was to be limited. the flag had to be struck when english ships were met and the right of search to be permitted. these demands
2303,1081-125237-0076.flac," for the new ruler of england had always professed himself an appointment of the war, which had shattered his fantastic dream of a union between the two republics. many conferences took place, but the protector's attitude and intentions were ambiguous and difficult to divine."
2304,1081-125237-0094.flac," address to the states of holland, not at the moment in session."
2305,1081-125237-0046.flac," ascue had previously sailed up the channel with 40 men of war and five fireships for a similar purpose. the two fleets met on august 16th, and despite his inferiority of force, derauter forced ascue to withdraw into plymouth and was able to bring his convoy home to safety."
2306,1081-125237-0023.flac, the right of search and the striking of the flag that were to be the real causes of the outbreak of a war that was desired by neither of the two governments. but popular feeling and the course of events was too strong for them. the news of the seizure of their vessels
2307,1081-125237-0064.flac, with the support of the army of dictatorial powers.
2308,1081-125237-0115.flac," not merely by the orange partisans, but by popular opinion, generally in the united provinces."
2309,1081-125237-0099.flac," that the act should be placed in his hands within two days after the ratification of the treaty was preemptory and threatening. unless he received the act he would consider the treaty as not binding upon him, using all his powers of advocacy."
2310,1081-125237-0063.flac," he induced the state's general by a bare majority for provinces to three, to send a conciliatory letter, the date of which, april 30, 1653, coincided with cromwell's forcible dissolution of the rump parliament, and the assumption by him,"
2311,1081-125237-0087.flac," but also dewitt was fully aware that the ascent of the estates of holland, to the proposed exclusion article, would only be obtained with the greatest difficulty. he was to prove himself a very past master in the art of diplomatic chcainery and intrigue."
2312,1081-125237-0054.flac," and he had more overbeen at sea without replenishment of stores ever since the fight at dungeoness, while the english had come straight from port. the fight"
2313,1081-125237-0058.flac," while the english on their side was shut out from the baltic where the king of denmark, as the ally of the united provinces, had closed the sound, and from the mediterranean, where admiral van gaillen,"
2314,1081-125237-0072.flac," monk, with about 100 ships, lay between them to prevent their junction. on august 4, trump sailed out, and after a rear-guard action of catwick, outmaneuvered the english commander and joined the wit. he now turned and with superior members, attack monk off shaving india."
2315,1081-125237-0039.flac," whereas in the netherlands there were five distinct boards of admiralty, to some extent jealous of each other, and now lacking the supreme direction of an admiral general. the war began by a series of english successes and of dutch misfortunes."
2316,1081-125237-0109.flac," informing them that the estates of holland ascended to the request made by the states general, and that they were to send back the secret correspondence and also the act if it were still undelivered. the result answered to his expectations."
2317,1081-125237-0113.flac," really believed that peace was an absolute necessity for his country, and that peace could only be maintained at the cost of the act of exclusion."
2318,1081-125237-0006.flac," and st. john and strickland greeted with loud cries of regicides and many abusive epithets, remembering the fate of dorislar were in fear of their lives."
2319,1081-125237-0010.flac," foremost among them prince edward, son of the queen of bohemia. the parliament threatened to recall the envoys, but consented that they should remain on the undertaking of the estates of holland to protect them from further attacks and to punish the offenders."

2335,1040-133433-0070.flac," of course, he did not strike her."
2336,1040-133433-0053.flac," wendy said it with a smile. she was as grown up as that. what did his crow sound like? jane asked one evening. it was like this, wendy said."
2337,1040-133433-0057.flac," he was exactly the same as ever, and wendy saw it once, that he still had all his first teeth. he was a little boy, and she was grown up. she huddled by the fire, not daring to move, helpless and guilty."
2338,1040-133433-0029.flac," who was tinkerbell? oh, peter, she said shocked. but even when she explained, he could not remember. there are such a lot of them, he said. i expect she is no more. i expect he was right for fairies don't live long."
2339,1040-133433-0014.flac," very soon. i don't want to go to school and learn solemn things. he told her passionately. i don't want to be a man. oh, wendy's mother, if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard! peter said wendy the comforter. i should love you in the beard."
2340,1040-133433-0049.flac," you have messed a bit, interrupts jane, who now knows the story better than her mother. when you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did you say? i sat up in bed and i said, boy, why are you crying?"
2341,1040-133433-0027.flac," she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but new adventures had crowded out the old ones from his mind. who is captain hook?"
2342,1040-133433-0065.flac," for almost the only time in his life that i know of, peter was afraid. don't turn up the light, he cried. she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. she was not a little girl heartbroken about him."
2343,1040-133433-0033.flac," peter came next spring cleaning, and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year. that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him. for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains."
2344,1040-133433-0056.flac," wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire, so as to see to darn. for there is no other light in the nursery. and while she sat darning, she heard a crow. then the window blew open as a volt."
2345,1040-133433-0035.flac," then a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. wendy was grown up. you need not be sorry for her. she was one of the kind that likes to grow up. in the end she grew up with her own free will, a day quicker than other girls."
2346,1040-133433-0063.flac," she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass. i can't come, she said apologetically. i have forgotten how to fly. i'll soon teach you again. oh peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me."
2347,1040-133433-0068.flac, i am old peter. i am ever so much more than 20. i grew up long ago. you promised not to. i couldn't help it.
2348,1040-133433-0006.flac, but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers.
2349,1040-133433-0051.flac," yes, wish did you like best of all? i think i liked the home under the ground best of all."
2350,1040-133433-0024.flac, but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor
2351,1040-133433-0062.flac," peter, she said, faltering, are you expecting me to fly away with you? of course, that is why i have come. he added a little sturdily. have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"
2352,1040-133433-0041.flac," she died of old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with, being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself. once a week, james nurse had her evening off."
2353,1040-133433-0009.flac," mind you, i am not sure that we have a drawing room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same. hoopla! he went off dancing through the house, and they all cried, hoopla, and danced after him, searching for the drawing room. and i forget whether they found it."
2354,1040-133433-0032.flac," perhaps he is ill, michael said. you know he is never ill. michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver. perhaps there is no such person wendy? and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying."
2355,1040-133433-0050.flac," yes, that was it,"" says jane, with a big breath. and then he flew us all the way to the neverland, and the fairies and the pirates and the red skins and the mermaids of goon."
2356,1040-133433-0064.flac, what is it he cried shaking?
2357,1040-133433-0019.flac," tink called out from somewhere around the corner. it doesn't matter, peter said. oh, peter, you know what matters."
2358,1040-133433-0060.flac," john is not here now, she guessed. is michael asleep? he asked for the careless glance of jane."
2359,1040-133433-0073.flac," yes, i know. i came back from my mother, he explained, to take your shirt that never land. yes, i know, jane said. i have been waiting for you."" when wendy returned diffidently, she found peter sitting on the bedpost crowing gloriously."
2360,1040-133433-0010.flac," but at any rate, they found corners and they all fitted in. as for peter, he saw wendy once again before he flew away. he did not exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him."
2361,1040-133433-0066.flac, she was a grown woman smiling at all.
2362,1040-133433-0030.flac, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them. wendy was pain too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to appear.
2363,1040-133433-0003.flac," that you don't do things by halves. a grudging remark, which the twins thought was pointed at them. the first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing. do you think we should be too much of a handful, sir? because if so, we can go away."
2364,1040-133433-0044.flac," that is a long time ago, sweetheart,"" says wendy. on me, how time flies. does it fly? ask the art for a child. the way you flew when you were a little girl?"
2365,1040-133433-0043.flac," i don't think i see anything tonight,"" says wendy, with a feeling that if nana were here, she would object to further conversation. yes, you do, says jane."
2366,1040-133433-0076.flac," it was already her easiest way of moving about. wendy rushed to the window. no, no, she cried. it is just for spring cleaning time, jane said. he wants me always to do his spring cleaning."
2367,1040-133433-0080.flac," in every spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland, where she tells him stories about himself to which he listens eagerly. when margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be peter's mother in turn."
2368,1040-133433-0022.flac," i suppose it was because wendy knew this, that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones. you won't forget me, peter, will you? before spring cleaning time comes? of course peter promised, and then he flew away. he took mrs. darling's kiss with him."
2369,1040-133433-0008.flac," it turned out that not one of them thought him a cipher, and he was absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing room if they faded in. well, if it didn't, sir, they assured him. then follow the leader, he cried galley."
2370,1040-133433-0071.flac," and when he did not know how to comfort him, though she could have done it so easily once, she was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room to try to think. peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke jane."
2371,1040-133433-0075.flac," he does so need a mother,"" jane said. yes, i know. wendy admitted rather forlornly. no one knows it so well as i. goodbye,"" said peter to wendy. and he rose in the air, and the shameless jane rose with him."
2372,1040-133433-0061.flac," that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her peter looked hello. was it a new one? yes, boy or girl? girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it"
2373,1040-133433-0000.flac," chapter 17. when wendy grew up. i hope you want to know what became of the other boys. they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them. and when they had counted 500, they went up."
2374,1040-133433-0078.flac, our last glimpse of her shows her at the window.
2375,1040-133433-0013.flac, would you send me to school he inquired craftily? yes. and then to an office? i suppose so.
2376,1040-133433-0042.flac," and then it was wendy's part to put jane to bed. that was the time for stories. it was jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head in her own, thus making a tent."
2377,1040-133433-0036.flac," all the boys were grown up and done for by this time, so it is scarcely worthwhile saying anything more about them. you may see the twins and nibs in curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella."
2378,1040-133433-0055.flac," jane said. i asked many girls here when they were sleeping, but i was the only one who heard it awake. lucky you said, jane. and then one night came the tragedy. it was the spring of the year."
2379,1040-133433-0048.flac, they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow.
2380,1040-133433-0018.flac, i shall have tink. tink get go a 20th part of the way around. i'm sure you're reminded to him a little tartly.
2381,1040-133433-0038.flac, and always had an odd inquiring look.
2382,1040-133433-0077.flac," if only i could go with you, wendy sighed. you see you can't fly, said jane. of course in the end, wendy let them fly away together."
2383,1040-133433-0023.flac," the kiss that had been for no one else, peter took quite easily. funny, but she seemed satisfied. of course all the boys went to school."
2384,1040-133433-0047.flac," well, perhaps when he admits she does see something, i do believe she says that it is this nursery. i do believe it is, says jane. go on."
2385,1040-133433-0072.flac," boy, she said, why are you crying? peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed. hello, he said. hello, said jane. my name is peter pan. he told her."
2386,1040-133433-0037.flac, you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? that used to be tutels. the bearded man who doesn't know any story to tell his children.
2387,1040-133433-0004.flac," father, wendy cried shocked, but still the cloud was on him. he knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it. ""'we could light double up,' said nibbs. ""'i always cut their hair myself,' said wendy.'"
2388,1040-133433-0054.flac, trying to imitate peter's crow. know it wasn't jane said gravely.
2389,1040-133433-0012.flac," that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject? no. about me, peter? no. mrs. darling came to the window."
2390,1040-133433-0079.flac," as you look at wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure little again. for all this happened long ago."
2391,1040-133433-0028.flac, when she spoke of the arts enemy. don't you remember? she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives? i forget them after i killed him. he replied carelessly. when she expressed a doubtful hope the tinkerbell would be glad to see her.
2392,1040-133433-0067.flac," then she turned up the light, and peter saw. he gave a cry of pain, and when the tall, beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms. he drew back sharply. what is it, he cried again. she had to tell him."
2393,1040-133433-0039.flac," when she was old enough to ask them, they were mostly about peter pan. she loved to hear of peter, and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place."
2394,1040-133433-0020.flac," may i, mummy? certainly not. i have got you home again, but i mean to keep you. but he does so need a mother, so do you, my love."" oh, alright, peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness merely."
2395,1040-133433-0058.flac," a big woman. hello, wendy. he said not noticing any difference, for he was thinking chiefly of himself. and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first. hello, peter."
2396,1040-133433-0002.flac," but they forgot about him. of course mrs. darling said at once that she would have them, but mr. darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather large number. i must say, he said to wendy,"
2397,1040-133433-0025.flac," in time they could not even fly after their hats. want of practice, they called it, but what it really meant was that they no longer believed. michael believed longer than the other boys."
2398,1040-133433-0045.flac," why can't you fly now, mother? because i am grown up, dearest. when people grow up, they forget the way. why do they forget the way? because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless."
2399,1040-133433-0011.flac," that was what she did. hello wendy, goodbye, he said. oh dear, are you going away? yes. you don't feel peter, she said, falteringly."
2400,1040-133433-0034.flac," and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy. and when they met again, wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her."
2401,1040-133433-0040.flac," who was no longer fond of stairs. mrs. darling was now dead and forgotten. there were only two beds in the nursery now, james and her nurses, and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away."
2402,1040-133433-0001.flac, they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression. they stood in a row in front of mrs. darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes. they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them.
2403,1040-133433-0052.flac," what was the last thing peter ever said to you? the last thing he ever said to me was, just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing. yes! but alas, he forgot all about me."
2404,1040-133433-0074.flac," while jane and her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy. she's my mother, peter explained, and jane descended and stood by his side with a look on her face that he'd like to see on ladies when they gazed at him."
2405,1040-133433-0031.flac," but he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the treetops. next year he did not come for her. she waited in a new frock because the old man simply would not meet, but he never came."
2406,1040-133433-0021.flac, long and coming. but this promise sent peter away quite gay again.
2407,1040-133433-0059.flac," she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible. something inside her was crying. woman, woman, let go of me."" hello, where is john? he asked, suddenly missing the third bed."
2408,1040-133433-0017.flac," because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born. and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies. they live in nests on the tops of trees, and the move ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are."
2409,1040-133433-0015.flac," and mrs. darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her. keep back, lady!"
2410,1040-133433-0026.flac," though they jeered at him, so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year. she flew away with peter and the frock she had woven from the leaves and berries in the neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become, but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself."
2411,1040-133433-0046.flac, it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly. what is gay and innocent and heartless?
2412,1040-133433-0007.flac," i don't think he is a cipher, tutel's quite instantly. do you think he is a cipher, curly? no, i don't. do you think he is a cipher slightly? rather not. twin, what do you think?"
2413,1040-133433-0016.flac," but where are you going to live? with tink in the house we built for wendy. the fairies are to put it high up among the treetops, where they sleep at nights. how lovely, cried wendy so longingly that mrs. darling tightened her grip. i thought all the fairies were dead, mrs. darling said."
2414,1040-133433-0069.flac," no, you're not. yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby. no, she's not."
2415,1040-133433-0005.flac," george, mrs. darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavorable light. then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. he was as glad to have the miss she was, he said."
2416,2952-408-0001.flac," for a long time he wandered about helplessly, and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night, when he perceived on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun, one of those little hermitages called"
2417,2952-408-0028.flac," since then, i have been no obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district. every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night. now, reverence, sir."
2418,2952-408-0011.flac," all then left the house, except the priest, who went to the room where the dead body was lying. the usual offerings had been set before the corpse, and a small buddhist lamp, tomeo, was burning."
2419,2952-408-0009.flac," then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the joining room, having been told of the priest's kind promises, came to thank him, after which the master of the house said, now reverence serve much as we regret to leave you alone. we must bid you farewell."
2420,2952-408-0021.flac," the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village, answered musso. i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder. he refused me lodging but told me the way here. the listeners looked at each other as an astonishment."
2421,2952-408-0012.flac," the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies, after which he entered into meditation. so meditating he remained, through several silent hours, and there was no sound in the deserted village."
2422,2952-408-0029.flac," help me by your prayers, i entreat you, so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence. no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared, and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant."
2423,2952-408-0022.flac," and after a moment of silence the master of the house said, reverend sir, there is no priest and there is no angitsu on the hill. for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood. muso said nothing more on the subject."
2424,2952-408-0000.flac," chickeningki. once, when muso kokushi."
2425,2952-408-0004.flac," but little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment. presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man, carrying a lighted lantern, entered the room respectfully saluted him and said,"
2426,2952-408-0018.flac," and to leave the corpse alone. whenever this law has been broken here to for, some great misfortune has followed. whenever it is obeyed, we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence. perhaps you have seen the cause."
2427,2952-408-0020.flac," what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time. musso then inquired, does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead? what priest, the young man asked?"
2428,2952-408-0007.flac," but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your father's death when i came. for though i was a little tired, i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest. had you told me, i could have performed the service before your departure."
2429,2952-408-0013.flac," but when the hush of the night was at its deepest, there noiselessly entered a shape, vague and vast, and in the same moment musso found himself without power to move or speak."
2430,2952-408-0014.flac," he saw that shape lift the corpse, as with hands. devour it, more quickly than a cat devours a rat, beginning at the head and eating everything, the hair and the bones and even the shroud. and the monstrous thing, having thus consumed the body,"
2431,2952-408-0023.flac," for it was evident that his kind host supposed him to have been diluted by some goblin. but after having bitten them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road, he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill, and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived."
2432,2952-408-0025.flac," you need not be ashamed for having refused me, shelter,"" said musso. you directed me to the village, john, where i was very kindly treated, and i thank you for that favor. i can give no mad shelter. the recluse made answer."
2433,2952-408-0017.flac," all of us were anxious about you, but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed. gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible, but the law of our village, as i told you last evening, oblige us to quit our houses after a death has taken place."
2434,2952-408-0006.flac," strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has dust been left, so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us. we can find you good lodging in the other village."
2435,2952-408-0016.flac," and looked about the room, no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings. but the master of the house said to musso, wherever in sur you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night."
2436,2952-408-0026.flac," so, in that time, the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here. sometimes from great distances, in order that i might repeat over them the holy service. but i repeated the service and performed the rights only as a matter of business."
2437,2952-408-0024.flac," and this time, its aged occupant invited him to enter. when he had done so, the hermit humbly bowed down before him, exclaiming, ah, i am ashamed, i am very much ashamed, i am exceedingly ashamed."
2438,2952-408-0008.flac," as it is, i shall perform the service after you have gone away, and i shall stay by the body until morning. i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone."
2439,2952-408-0005.flac, the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village.
2440,2952-408-0027.flac," i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain, and because of the selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death, into the state of a jikininki."
2441,2952-408-0010.flac," by the rule of our village, none of us can stay here after midnight. we beg, kind sir, that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are unable to attend upon you. and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence, please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning."
2442,2952-408-0019.flac," then musso told of dim and awful shape that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings. no person seemed to be surprised by his narration, and the master of the house observed."
2443,2952-408-0003.flac," this the old man harshly refused, but he directed musso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining, where lodging and food could be obtained. musso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages,"
2444,2952-408-0015.flac," turned to the offerings and ate them also. then it went away as mysteriously as it had come. when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headman's dwelling, all in turn saluted him, and when they had entered."
2445,2952-408-0002.flac," which are built for solitary priests. it seemed to be in ruinous condition, but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest, from whom he begged the favor of a knight's lodging."
2446,2952-407-0016.flac," for the same reason that sister helen made a little man of wax, and nail it."

2516,2952-410-0020.flac," tonight i shall recite the sutras for your sake, and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors. with these assurances, queryo bade the aruchi goodnight, and his host showed him to a very small side room where a bed had been made ready."
2517,2952-410-0001.flac," but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone, and as his heart remained true to his former lord, he preferred to give up the world. so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest, taking the buddhist name of quaido."

2520,2952-410-0023.flac," and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night. quyrio felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water, and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house, he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household."
2521,2952-410-0006.flac," and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of great surprise, what kind of man can you be, good sir, that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this? there are haunters about here. many of them. are you not afraid of hairy things?"

2524,2952-410-0029.flac," then from behind a trunk he caught sight of the heads. all five of them, flitting about, chatting as they flitted. they were eating worms and insects which they found on the ground or among the trees."
2525,2952-410-0024.flac," very gently he pushed apart the sliding screens that separated his room from the main apartment, and he saw, by the light of the lantern, five recumbent bodies, without heads."

2527,2952-410-0028.flac," gently unbarring the door, he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it. he heard voices talking in the grove, and he went in the direction of the voices, stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place."
2528,2952-410-0017.flac," retribution followed me, and i long remained effugitive in the land. now i often pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did, and to reestablish the ancestral home, but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing."
2529,2952-410-0025.flac," for one instant he stood bewildered, imagining a crime, but in another moment he perceived that there was no blood, and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut. then he thought to himself."

2624,2691-156745-0042.flac," noticed his affection for that sorrowing girl, who was too pretty to be in this new country without a protector. they also recalled how perry mccoon's launch had brought supplies up the river for the second relief to take over the mountains."
2625,2691-156745-0001.flac," the report of our affliction spread rapidly, and the well-meaning tender-hearted women at the fort came to condole and weep with us, and made their children weep also by urging"
2626,2691-156745-0031.flac," not a soul was in sight when we started toward the fort, all unconscious of what the inevitable is to be was weaving into our lives."

2628,2691-156745-0020.flac," notwithstanding these plans for our well-being, unaccountable delays followed, making our situation daily more trying."
2629,2691-156745-0012.flac," he stated that he offered her food, which she refused. he then attempted to persuade her to wait until morning, and while they were talking, she sank upon the floor completely exhausted, and he covered her with blankets and made a fire to warm her."
2630,2691-156745-0032.flac," we were too young to keep track of time by calendar, but counted it by happenings. some were marked with tears, some with smiles, and some stole unawares upon us, just as on that bright june evening."
2631,2691-156745-0039.flac," tears came also to the child wife's eyes as she clasped her arms about us soothingly, assuring us that she was still our sister and would care for us. nevertheless,"
2632,2691-156745-0016.flac," also, of what was said about the alleged murder of our mother. still, we did hear fragments of conversations which greatly disturbed us, and our sisters found it difficult to answer some of our questions. meanwhile,"
2633,2691-156745-0023.flac," they had no way of communicating with our friends in eastern states, and the women at the fort could ill afford to provide longer for us since their breadwinners were still with freemont, and their own supplies were limited."
2634,2691-156745-0008.flac," but also of having wantedly taken the life of mrs. murphy and of my mother. some declared him crazy, others called him a monster. keseberg denied these charges and"
2635,2691-156745-0002.flac, now do say something comforting to these poor little girls who were frozen and starved up in the mountains and are now orphans in a strange land without any home or anyone to care for them. such ordeals were too overwhelming.
2636,2691-156745-0014.flac," saved him from personal violence, but not from suspicion and ill will. women shunned him, and children stoned him as he walked about the fort. the california star printed in full the account of the fallon party."

2642,2691-156745-0033.flac, when we did not find our sisters and aimlessly followed others to the little shop where a friendly appearing elderly man was cutting slices of meat and handing them to customers.
2643,2691-156745-0006.flac," intense excitement and indignation prevailed at the fort after captain fallon and other members of his party gave their account of the condition found at the mountain camps and of interviews had with keseberg, who may now called cannibal."
2644,2691-156745-0030.flac," she tossed the bundle from her head, sprang into the water, snatched francis as she rose to the surface, and restored her to us without a word. before we had recovered sufficiently to speak, she was gone."
2645,2691-156745-0025.flac," was where night overtook us. often we trudged to the rancherilla beyond the pond, made by the adobe mollors who had built the houses and walls surrounding the fort. there the indian mothers were good to us."

2652,8609-283227-0054.flac," as i hope you will allow, in some imperfect measure god is worshiped, and the truth is preached in it. most willingly would i pay the money, i object simply because the rate is compulsory. and therein you have our lord's example to the contrary."
2653,8609-283227-0067.flac," and cost him nothing. i need not say he never became a churchman, or that i never expected he would. all his memories of a religious childhood, all the sources of the influences which had refined and elevated him were surrounded with other associations,"
2654,8609-283227-0042.flac," our lord did not refuse to acknowledge their authority, notwithstanding the many ways in which they had degraded the religious observances of the jewish church. he acknowledged himself a child of the church, but said that as a child he ought to have been left to contribute as he pleased."
2655,8609-283227-0038.flac," my dear sir, i do not like writing letters, especially on subjects of importance. there are a thousand chances of misunderstanding, whereas in a personal interview there is a possibility of controversy being hallowed by communion."
2656,8609-283227-0025.flac," i stretched out my hand, but the broker was before me. without another word he pocketed the money, jumped into his cart with his man and drove off, leaving the church-warden and the parsing, standing at the door of the dissenting minister with his mahogany table on the path between them. now, mr. brownrig, i said,"
2657,8609-283227-0066.flac," and many a time, ere his death, we consulted together about things that prefer. once he came to me about illegal difficulty in connection with the deed of trust of his chapel, and although i could not help him myself, i directed him to such help as was thorou,"
2658,8609-283227-0063.flac," i only say that in separating from us you are in effect and by your conduct, saying to us, do not preach for you follow not with us. i will not be guilty of the same towards you. your fathers did the church no end of good by leaving it."
2659,8609-283227-0047.flac," may i hope that you will do me the credit to believe that if i saw clearly that they were the same thing, i would not hesitate a moment to follow our lord's example. i believe it perfectly. therefore, however, we may defer we are in reality at no strife."
2660,8609-283227-0057.flac," i am relieved to speak my mind knowing he would have us speak our minds to each other, but i do not want to proselytize. if you change your mind, you will probably do so on different grounds for many i give you."
2661,8609-283227-0010.flac," but of extreme use as i heard upon insignificant points and moved by a great dislike to national churches in episcopacy. this, i say, is what i had made out about him from what i had heard."
2662,8609-283227-0039.flac, to mrs. templeton for not inviting her with you.
2663,8609-283227-0002.flac," i had so far recovered that i was able to rise about noon and go into my study, though i was very weak, and had not yet been out, when one morning mrs. pearson came into the room and said, please, sir."
2664,8609-283227-0023.flac," before such a thing should have happened, i feel so disgraced i am ashamed to look mr. templeton in the face, carry the table into the house again directly. it's my property now, interpose the broker. i bought it of the church warden, and paid for it."
2665,8609-283227-0036.flac, the gist of the letter laying these words. i confess it perplexes me to understand how to reconcile your christian and friendly behavior to one whom most of your brethren would consider as much beneath their notice as inferior to them in social position.
2666,8609-283227-0064.flac," but it is time to unite now. once more followed a silence. if people could only meet and look each other in the face,"" said mr. templeton at length, they might find there was not such a gulf between them as they had fancied. and so we parted."
2667,8609-283227-0051.flac," i will yield the point when you can show me the same ground for believing the church of england, the national church, appointed such by god that i can show you, and you know already for receiving the jewish church as the appointment of god."
2668,8609-283227-0045.flac," or what came to the same thing make us servant of his father, namely a fish in the sea of galilee."
2669,8609-283227-0018.flac," which stood at the door, breathless with haste, i was yet able to call out. put that table down directly. at the same moment, mr. brownrig appeared from within the door."
2670,8609-283227-0069.flac," i am sure that his feelings were moderated, even changed towards her. and though this may seem of no consequence to one who loves the church more than the brotherhood, it does not seem of little consequence to me who love the church because of the brotherhood, of which it is the type and the restore."
2671,8609-283227-0001.flac," been said about the election of a colleague, so little seemed to fall into the duty of the church warden that i regarded the neglect as a trifle, and was remiss in setting it right. i had therefore to suffer, as was just. indeed, mr. brownrig was not the man to have power in his hands unchecked."
2672,8609-283227-0005.flac," to my churchwarden, we must call a vestry before long and have this look to. now, my predecessor had left everything of the kind to his church wardens, and the inhabitants from their side had likewise left the whole affair to the church wardens. but mr. brownrig."
2673,8609-283227-0070.flac," it was long before another church-rate was levied in marshmallows, and when the circumstance did take place, no one dreamed of calling on mr. templeton for his share in it. but having heard of it, he called himself upon the church-warden, mr. brownrig still, and offered the money cheerfully."
2674,8609-283227-0003.flac," confident, there must be a good reason for it, and so told mrs. pearson to show him in. oh, sir! i know you would be vexed if you hadn't been told,"" he exclaimed, and i am sure you will not be angry with me for troubling you. what is the matter, tom, i said?"
2675,8609-283227-0017.flac," but such was the commotion in my mind that i had become quite unconscious of illness or even feebleness. hurring on and more terror than i can well express, lest i should be too late, i reached mr. templeton's house. just as a small mahogany table was being hoisted into a spring cart,"
2676,8609-283227-0011.flac," and my reader will very probably be inclined to ask, but why, with principles such as yours, should you have only hearsay to go upon? why did you not make the honest man's acquaintance? in such a small place, men should not keep each other at arm's length."
2677,8609-283227-0061.flac, are they not countless modes of saying the truth? you have some of them. i hope i have some.
2678,8609-283227-0022.flac," his face had lengthened considerably by this time, and its rubicon to you declined. i did not think you would stand upon ceremony about it, sir."
2679,8609-283227-0007.flac," he did during my illness, with the notion of pleasing me, by the discovery that the repairs had been already affected according to my mind, nor did any one of my congregation through the least difficulty in the church wardens way. and now i must refer to another circumstance in the history of my parish."
2680,8609-283227-0026.flac," let me hand to carry this table in again. he yielded, not graciously, that could not be expected, but in silence. oh, sir! interpose, young tom, who had stood by during the dispute, let me take it! you're not able to lift it!"
2681,8609-283227-0048.flac," but is there not this difference that our lord was, as you say, a child of the jewish church, which was indowitably established by god? now, if i cannot conscientiously belong to the so-called english church, why should i have to pay church rate or tribute?"
2682,8609-283227-0055.flac," a silence followed, for i had to deal with an honest man who was thinking. i resumed. a thousand difficulties will no doubt come up to be considered in the matter. do not suppose i am anxious to convince you. i believe that our father, our elder brother,"
2683,8609-283227-0033.flac," mr. brownrig, i spoke in heat when i came up to you, and i am sure i did you wrong. i am certain you had no improper motive in not making me acquainted with your proceedings. you meant no harm to me, but you did very wrong toward mr. templeton. i will try to show you that when i am well again."
2684,8609-283227-0046.flac," it is wrong to compel and wrong to refuse the payment of a church rate. i do not say equally wrong. it is much worse to compel than to refuse."" you are very generous, return mr. templeton."
2685,8609-283227-0059.flac," don't you regard me as an interloper now? one who has no right to speak because he does not belong to the church? god forbid, i answered. if a word of mine would make you leave my parish tomorrow, i dare not say it."
2686,8609-283227-0030.flac," glancing first at the table, then at me, and then at mr. brownrig, is it begging someone to tell him what to say? but i did not leave him a moment in this perplexity. mr. templeton, i said, quitting the table, and holding out my hand."
2687,8609-283227-0068.flac," than those of the church in her forms. the church was his grandmother, not his mother, and he had not made any acquaintance with her until comparatively late in life. but while i do not say that his intellectual objections to the church were less strong than they had been,"
2688,8609-283227-0027.flac, and so mr. brownrig and i blend her into the little parlor with our burden. not a great one.
2689,8609-283227-0031.flac," that you should have been annoyed like this. i have, mr. templeton interrupted me. i assure you it was a matter of conscience with me, he said, on no other ground. i know it, i know it, i said interrupting him in my turn."
2690,8609-283227-0037.flac," with your remaining the minister of a church in which such anormaties, as you employed your private influence to counteract in my case, are not only possible, but certainly lawful, and recognized by most of its members as likewise expedient. to this, i replied,"
2691,8609-283227-0020.flac," now, i said, carry it back into the house. my sir imposed mr. brownrig, it's all right. yes, i said, as right as the devil would have it."
2692,8609-283227-0012.flac," and any reader who says so will say right. all i have to suggest for myself is simply a certain shyness for which i cannot entirely account, but which was partly made up of fear to intrude, or of being supposed to irrigate to myself the right of making advances."
2693,8609-283227-0019.flac," i think he had not heard me. you see, i'm prompt, mr. walton, he said, but bless my soul, how ill you look. without answering him, for i was more angry with him than i ought to have been, i repeated. put that table down, i tell you. they did so."
2694,8609-283227-0058.flac," and i haven't been to a university like you, but i'm no fool either. i hope. don't be offended at my question. wouldn't you be glad to see me out of your parish now? i began to speak, but he went on."
2695,8609-283227-0021.flac," i'm not so sure of that. i believe i had the right to be chairman at the vestry meeting, but instead of even letting me know you took advantage of my illness to hurry on matters to this shameful and wicked excess. i did the poor man wrong in this, for i believe he had heard things really to please me."
2696,8609-283227-0049.flac," shall i tell you the argument that english church might then use? the church might say, then you are a stranger and no child. therefore, like the kings of the earth, we may take tribute of you. so you see it would come to this that dissenters alone should be compelled to pay church rates."
2697,8609-283227-0004.flac," which were necessary and must be done before another winter. i confess i was rather pleased for i wanted my people to feel that the church was their property, and that it was their privilege if they could regard it as a blessing to have the church, to keep it in decent order and repair."
2698,8609-283227-0040.flac," how you could belong to a church with authorizes things of which you yourself so heartily disapprove. and i answer you, i returned that just to such a church are lord belonged. i do not quite understand you. i lord belong to the jewish church."
2699,8609-283227-0056.flac," and the spirit that proceeded from them is teaching you, as i believe, i too am being taught by the same. why then should i be anxious to convince you of anything? will you not, in his good time, come to see what he would have you see,"
2700,8609-283227-0015.flac," had on this very day been visited by the church warden, a company by a broker from the neighboring town of addishead, and at the very time when i was hearing of the fact was suffering to strength of his goods. the poor scene head of the church warden was not on his shoulders by accident, nor without significance."
2701,8609-283227-0043.flac," to the support of its ordinances, and not to be compelled after such a fashion. there, i have you exclaimed, mr. templeton."
2702,8609-283227-0024.flac," but i tell you the whole affair is illegal, and if you carry away the table, i shall see what the law will do for me. i assure you i will prosecute you myself. you take up that money where i will. it will go to pay counsel. i give you my word if you do not take it to quench strife."
2703,8609-283227-0014.flac," mr. templeton then had refused, as a point of conscience, to pay the church raid when the collector went round to demand it. had been summoned before a magistrate in consequence, had suffered a default, and proceedings being pushed from the first in all the pride of mr. brownrig's legality,"
2704,8609-283227-0009.flac," amongst whom were the families of two or three farmers of substance, while the village and its neighborhood contributed a portion of the poorest of their inhabitants. a year or two before i came, their minister died, and they had chosen another, a very worthy man of considerable air-addition,"
2705,8609-283227-0065.flac," now, i do not write all this for the sake of the church-rate question. i write it to commemorate the spirit in which mr. templeton met me. for it is of consequence that two men who love their master should recognize each that the other does so, and they're upon, if not before."
2706,8609-283227-0034.flac," but, but you mustn't talk more now. it's a dr. duncan. so i shook hands with mr. brownrig and we parted. i fear from what i know of my church warden that he went home with a conviction that he had done perfectly right."
2707,8609-283227-0006.flac," who i must say had taken more pains than might have been expected of him to make himself acquainted with the legalities of his office, did not fail to call a vestry, to which, as usual, no one had responded. whereupon, he imposed a rate according to his own unated judgement, this, i believe,"
2708,8609-283227-0060.flac," i do not want to incur the rebuke of our lord, for surely the words forbid him not, involved some rebuke. would it not be a fearful thing that one soul, because of a deed of mine, should receive a less portion of elevation, or comfort in his journey towards his home?"
2709,8609-283227-0035.flac, and amongst them by mr. templeton. and here i may as well sketch the result of that strange introduction to the dissenting minister.
2710,8609-283227-0053.flac," having received from it a thousand influences for good. if in no other way, yet through your fathers to find it no great hardship and not very unreasonable, to pay a trifle to keep and repair one of the tabernacles in which our forefathers worship together,"
2711,8609-283227-0008.flac," there was a little chapel down a lane leading from the main street of the village, in which there was service three times every sunday."
2712,8609-283227-0062.flac," who will not hear me, preach to them in the name and love of god, mr. templeton. speak that you do know and testify that you have seen. you and i will help each other in proportion as we serve the master."
2713,8609-283227-0050.flac," we both laughed at this pushing of the argument to illegitimate conclusions. then i resumed. but the real argument is that not for such faults should we separate from each other, not for such faults or any faults, so long as it is the repository of the truth should you separate from the church."
2714,8609-283227-0029.flac," but when we entered, he rose. he was a man of middle size, about forty, with short black hair and overhanging bushy eyebrows. his mouth indicated great firmness, not unmingled with sweetness and even with humor. he smiled as he rose, but looked embarrassed."
2715,8609-283227-0016.flac," but i did not wait to understand all this now. it was enough for me that tom bore witness to the fact that at that moment proceedings were thus driven to extremity. i rang the bell for my boots, and, to the open mouth to smeibniz's pearson, left the vicarage leaning on tom's arm."
2716,8609-283227-0032.flac," i beg your pardon, and i have done my best to make amends for it. offences must come, you know, mr. templeton, but i trust i have not incurred the woe that follows upon them by means of whom they come. for i knew nothing of it, and indeed was too ill."
2717,8609-283227-0013.flac," partly of a dreadless we should not be able to get on together, and so the attempt should result in something unpleasantly awkward. i dare say likewise that the natural shelliness of the english had something to do with it. at all events, i had not made his acquaintance."
2718,8609-283227-0044.flac," i granted it is entirely wrong, a very unchristian proceeding, but our lord did not therefore desert the church as you would have me do. he paid the money, lest he should offend. and not having it of his own, he had to ask his father for it."
2719,8609-283227-0052.flac," that would involve a long argument upon which, though i have little doubt upon the matter myself, i cannot say i am prepared to enter at this moment. meantime i would just ask you whether you are not sufficiently a child of the church of england."
2720,8609-283227-0000.flac," he and another farmer, his neighbor, had been so often reelected church wardens that at last they seemed to have gained a prescriptive right to the office, and the form of election fell into disuse."
2721,8609-283227-0028.flac," mr. templeton sat in a windsor chair in the middle of the room. evidently, the table had been carried away from before him, leaving his position uncovered. the floor was strewn with the books which had laid upon it. he sat reading an old folio as if nothing had happened."
2722,8609-262281-0017.flac," are you going to the meeting this afternoon? of course not, sid constance, my time now belongs to you. but i think mama wishes you to go with us. she said something about it. does she? i should very much like to go."
2723,8609-262281-0020.flac," not very early answered constance hitherto, i have risen at seven summer in winter, dressing and reading take me just an hour. for the other hour i find plenty of occupation. we do not breakfast until nine on account of tom and charlie. i shall rise at six now."
2724,8609-262281-0026.flac," but then good resolutions were forgotten and idleness followed. not only idleness, temper also."
2725,8609-262281-0002.flac," preparing their lessons. fanny came running in. her hair and curl papers, some bread and butter in her hand. carrie has not finished her breakfast, miss channing. quas she. she was lazy this morning. i think someone else was lazy also, said constance, gently drawing the child to her."
2726,8609-262281-0010.flac," i was in such a passion! constance wondered where she should begin. there was so much to do, so much to alter in so many ways, to set to work abruptly would never answer. it must be commenced gradually, almost imperceptibly, little by little. caroline."
2727,8609-262281-0005.flac," be so kind to take the papers out of miss fanny's hair, and let it be done in the future martha before she comes to me. gently as the words were spoken there was no mistaking that the tone was one of authority, and not to be trifled with."
2728,8609-262281-0022.flac," not at all, and said lady augusta, i never shop a room to children to a crowded meeting. people might say they took up the room of grown-up persons. you will let me go, not caroline, miss channing, pleaded fanny with her mother."
2729,8609-262281-0030.flac," if that anticipated living would fall in, which seems very far away in the clouds, and you were holy mine, we might have carerline with us for a time, laughter, mr. york. constance laughed too. do not be impatient."
2730,8609-262281-0016.flac," caroline burst into tears. i should do better if mama were not so cross with me, miss channing. i always do anything that william york asks me, and i will do anything for you. constance kister. then will you begin by rising early and being ready for me at seven?"
2731,8609-262281-0014.flac," annabelle is fond of talking nonsense, but she is a good, loving child at heart."
2732,8609-262281-0018.flac," lady augusta came in and profered the invitation to constance to accompany them. constance then spoke of giving the children the extra two hours from seven to nine. it was really necessary, she said, if she was to do her duty by them."
2733,8609-262281-0003.flac," why did you come down half-dressed, my dear?"" i'm quite dressed, responded fanny, my frock son, and so was my pinnacle. and these, said constance, touching the curl-papers. oh, martha got up late, and said she had no time to take them out."
2734,8609-262281-0037.flac," think of all that is at stake. renewed health, exertion, happiness, arthur."
2735,8609-262281-0031.flac," or it will seem to be further off still. it will come, william. they had been speaking in an undertone, standing together at a window apart from the rest. mr. channing was lying on his sofa, underneath the other window, and now spoke to mr. york."
2736,8609-262281-0033.flac," i have heard so. his complaint was rheumatism, very much as i fancy the same sort of rheumatism that afflicts you. he told me he came to europe with very little hope. he feared his complaint had become chronic and incurable."
2737,8609-262281-0012.flac," would you undertake to get up and be ready for me, ask constance? caroline drew a long face. she did not speak. my dear, you are fifteen. well, responded caroline."
2738,8609-262281-0039.flac," dr. lambs at the cost was so trifling as scarcely to be credited, continued mr. york in a tone of reminstrance, arthur, don't you care to help, to save him? i would move heaven and earth to save my father, impulsively spoke arthur."
2739,8609-262281-0001.flac," constance would willingly have commenced the daily routine at an earlier hour. lady augusta freely confessed that to coming earlier would be useless, for she could not get her daughters up. strictly speaking, lady augusta did not personally try to get them up."
2740,8609-262281-0034.flac," but he has been restored in a wonderful manner and is in sound health again. and what remedies did he use? eagerly asked mr. channing. a three-month residence at some medicinal springs in germany, nothing else. when i say nothing else, of course i must imply that he was under medical treatment there."
2741,8609-262281-0036.flac," the channings themselves were silent. they could not see the way at all clear. when mr. york was leaving, he back in constance and arthur into the hall."
2742,8609-262281-0041.flac, did you think i was lost? i was seduced into joining your missionary meeting people and had to stop late at the office to make up for it.
2743,8609-262281-0008.flac," it is not for that i wish to go, said caroline, i think meetings where there's nothing but talk or the dullest thing in the world. if i were to listen it would send me to sleep. then why do you wish so much to attend this one? because i shall wear my new dress."
2744,8609-262281-0000.flac," 16. much to alter. at the same moment constance channing was traversing the boundaries, on her way to lady augusta york's, where she had some day since commenced her duties. it took her scarcely two minutes to get there, for the houses were almost within view of each other."
2745,8609-262281-0042.flac," fresh hope seems to arise daily that those german vows would restore him to health. they cure dr. lamb. i say, hamish, that the money must be found for it somehow, atadmister york. found? of course it shall be found, cried gay, hamish."
2746,8609-262281-0023.flac," no, said caroline sharply, miss channing will fix upon me. i shall obey lady augusta."
2747,8609-262281-0015.flac," i have so much to teach you, caroline, to your mind and heart, as well as to your intellect that i feel the hours as it present arranged will be insufficient for me. my dear, when you grow up to womanhood i am sure you will wish to be loving and loved."""
2748,8609-262281-0025.flac," you must not be disappointed if, in that case, i give the privilege to caroline as being the elder of the two, but i will make it up to you in some other way. alas, for poor caroline's resolution, for a short time and hour, so she did strive to do her best."
2749,8609-262281-0028.flac," which she had not learned in the day. how shall you get on with them, constance? the reverend william york and choir to her that same evening have the weeds destroyed the good seed. not quite destroyed it, replied constance, though she sied sadly as she spoke."
2750,8609-262281-0032.flac, replied mr. channing. i think it is possible that his experience in another line may be of service to you. continued mr. york.
2751,8609-262281-0035.flac," it is the very thing you see, sir, that has been ordered for you. i, side mr. channing, feeling how very faint it appeared to be the hope that he should have the opportunity of trying it. i was mentioning your case to him, mr. york."
2752,8609-262281-0027.flac," she even forgot herself so far as to be insolent. fanny was taken to the meeting. you saw her in the carriage when lady augusta drove to mr. galaway's office and persuaded hamish to join them. caroline was left at home in a state of open rebellion, with the lessons to learn."
2753,8609-262281-0024.flac, it will be only right to do so. suppose we are both good and merit-equally suggested fanny.
2754,8609-262281-0013.flac," deficient in many ways, caroline, in goodness, in thoughtfulness, and in other desirable qualities, and greatly so in education. annabelle, who is a year younger than you, is twice as advanced. annabelle says you worry her into learning."
2755,8609-262281-0006.flac," martha withdrew with the child, and just then caroline came in full of eagerness. miss channing, mama says, she shall take one of us to the missionary meeting whichever you choose to fix upon. mind you, fix upon me."
2756,8609-262281-0009.flac, i have not had it on yet.
2757,8609-262281-0021.flac," and come here at seven. very well, said lady augusta, i suppose this will only apply to the summer months. one of the girls shall go with us today, whichever deserves it best. you are not leaving one of them at home to make room for me, i hope, lady augusta."
2758,8609-262281-0019.flac," you will never put up with our scrambling breakfast mischannin, the boys are so unruly, and i do not get up to it half my time."
2759,8609-262281-0011.flac," in what way, miss channing? did i not request you to have that exercise written out? i know, said caroline was some contrition. i intended to write it out this morning before you came, but somehow i lay in bed."
2760,8609-262281-0029.flac," there's so much ill to undo, caroline is the worst, the weeds with her have had long time to get ahead. i think perhaps, if i could keep her holy with me for a twelve-month or so, watching over her constantly, a great deal might be affected."
2761,8609-262281-0004.flac," constance rang the bell. martha, who is the only made-capticecook, appeared in answer to it. lady augusta was want to say that she had too much expense with her boys to keep many servants, and the argument was a true one."
2762,8609-262281-0043.flac," i intend to be a chief contributor to it myself, but his joking words in careless manner jared at that moment upon the spirit both of arthur and constance channing. why?"
2763,8609-262281-0038.flac," arthur did not feel hopeful. indeed his heart sank within him the whole time that they were talking. hamish and his difficulties were the dark shadow, though he could not tell this to mr. york. we're mr. channing to go abroad, and the arrest of hamish to follow upon it."
2764,8609-262281-0007.flac," some of the anecdotes are beautiful. who told you they were?"" asked caroline. mr. york replied constance a pretty blush rising to her cheek. he knows the lecture well. you would be pleased to hear them."
2765,8609-262281-0040.flac," stung by the implied proof, i should not care what the labor it cost me to procure the money so that i succeeded. we all would sit constants, you must know we would, william, from hamish downwards."
2766,7402-59171-0022.flac," by a hurried alteration of atmosphere in this manner. comedy, as well as tragedy, must create some kind of illusion, and the destruction of the illusion even for the sake of a joke, may mean the destruction of laughter."
2767,7402-59171-0042.flac," because it is from an orthodox point of view, geniality in the wrong place. it is like a grin in church, a laugh at a marriage service."
2768,7402-59171-0014.flac," he sees men and women too frequently in the refracting shallows of theories. he is a doctrine heir, and his characters are often comic statements of his doctrines rather than the reflections of men and women."
2769,7402-59171-0023.flac," the proportion of unreality is not overwhelming. it has been enormously exaggerated. after all, if the character of the newspaperman in the doctor's dilemma is machine-made,"
2770,7402-59171-0005.flac, seems like life in ruins are filled at times with a wild lust to denounce and belittle him. he has been called more names than any other man of letters alive.
2771,7402-59171-0048.flac," it may be said of mr. shaw that in his politics, as in his place, he has sought utopia along the path of dissolution. as other men have sought it along the path of idealism."
2772,7402-59171-0006.flac," when all the other names have been exhausted and we are about to become in articulate, we even denounce him as a boar. but this is only the billing skate of our exasperation. mr. shaw is not a boar."
2773,7402-59171-0021.flac," because into an atmosphere of more or less naturalistic comedy, they simply introduce a four-cycle exaggeration of mr. shaw's opinion of the incompetent impedance of journalists. mr. shaw's comedies are repeatedly injured."
2774,7402-59171-0046.flac," a great number of people thought he must be a pro-german. the fact is, in wartime, more than at any other time, people dread the vision of the satirist and the skeptic."
2775,7402-59171-0018.flac," admirably true both to human nature and to mr. shaw's view of the human nature of artist. but when he goes on with his last breath to other his artistic creed, i believe in michelangelo velasquez and rembrandt in the might of design,"
2776,7402-59171-0019.flac," the redemption of all things by beauty everlasting, and the message of art that has made these hands blessed, amen, amen. these sentences are no more natural or naturalistic."
2777,7402-59171-0030.flac, a few only of these latter types are given us by mollier.
2778,7402-59171-0034.flac," is an offering at a shrine. the true things it contains, however, make it worth reading."
2779,7402-59171-0025.flac," it is much more necessary that we should recognize that amid all this falsifications, doctrinal and jocular, he has a genuine comic sense of character. most french critics."
2780,7402-59171-0045.flac," though his attitude to the war was as anti-pression,"
2781,7402-59171-0047.flac," this is not to disparage mr. shaw's contributions to the discussion of politics. that contribution has been brilliant, challenging, and humane. and not more waver than the contribution of the partisan."
2782,7402-59171-0007.flac, whatever else he may be. he has succeeded in the mere business of interesting us beyond any other writer of his time.
2783,7402-59171-0035.flac," for instance, what many critics have failed to see that in his dramatic work, mr. shaw is less a wit than a humorist. in shaw's work, we find few studied guests, few epigrams even."
2784,7402-59171-0012.flac, he is in the line of all those tramps and stage irishmen who have gone through life with so fine a swagger of words. this only means that in his life he is an artist.
2785,7402-59171-0029.flac," mollier depicts the miser, the jealous man, the missinthrop, the hypocrite, whereas shaw depicts the bourgeois, the rebel, the capitalist, the workman, the socialist, the doctor."
2786,7402-59171-0040.flac," he has done this sometimes with all the exuberance of birth, sometimes with all the bitterness of a satirist. even his bitterness has never venomous however. he is genial beyond the majority of inveterate controversialists and propagandists."
2787,7402-59171-0002.flac," he has gone about like a pickpocket of illusions from the world of literature to the world of morals, and from the world of morals to the world of politics. and everywhere he has gone, an innumerable growl has followed him."
2788,7402-59171-0017.flac," rather, when he is presenting a queer, fizzing mixture of human nature and his opinions about it. this may be sometimes actually a virtue in his comedy. certainly from the time of aristophanes onward,"
2789,7402-59171-0004.flac," because he has always been able to laugh at his disciples as unfealingly as at anybody else. he has courted unpopularity as other men have courted popularity. he has refused to assume the vacuous count inside their of an idol,"
2790,7402-59171-0032.flac," is intended as a biography and general criticism of mr. shaw, as well as a comparison between his work and molliers. it contains, it must be confessed. a great deal that is not new to english readers."
2791,7402-59171-0036.flac," mollier anticipated mr. shaw in outraging the sentiment, for instance, which has gathered around the family. mollier and shaw, as he puts it with quaint seriousness, appear to be unaware of what a father is, what a father is worth."
2792,7402-59171-0038.flac," he is his own. he has studied with his own eyes the swollen, bellied pretenses of preachers and poets, and rich men and lovers and politicians, and he has derided them as they have never been derided on the english stage before."
2793,7402-59171-0016.flac," one is bound to contradict him. mr. shaw often thinks he is presenting true human nature when he is merely presenting his opinions about human nature, the human nature of soldiers, of artists, of women, or"
2794,7402-59171-0003.flac," not that he has not had his disciples, men and women who believe that what mr. shaw says on any conceivable subject is far more important than what the times or the manchester guardian says. he has never found the church, however,"
2795,7402-59171-0000.flac," mr. shaw came for a short time recently to be regarded less as an author than as an incident in the european war. in the opinion of many people, it seemed as if the allies were fighting against a combination composed of germany."
2796,7402-59171-0015.flac," he observes in one of the many passages in which he justifies himself. the audience thinks it is being made fun of. in reality, i am simply a very careful writer of natural history."
2797,7402-59171-0043.flac," that he was not intensely serious in all that he wrote about the war. but his seriousness is essentially the seriousness of, in the higher sense of the word, the comic artist of the disillusionist."
2798,7402-59171-0008.flac," probably he was doomed to be a figure just as dr. johnson was. if he had not told us legends about himself,"
2799,7402-59171-0013.flac," until we realize that he is an artist, not only in the invention of his own life, but in the observation of the lives of other people. his broadband is as wonderful a figure as his george bernard shaw. not that his portraiture is always faithful."
2800,7402-59171-0027.flac," mollier has never drawn a doctor more comically the doctor than paramore. nor more characteristic figures of women than those in the same play, the philanderer. the character drawing is admirable."
2801,7402-59171-0011.flac, my business would immediately begin to fall off. you blame me for having declared myself to be the most remarkable man of my time? but the claim is an arguable one. why should i not say it when i believe that it is true?
2802,7402-59171-0039.flac," he has derided them with both an artistic and a moral energy. he has brought them all into a palace of truth, where they have revealed themselves with an unacustomed and startling frankness."
2803,7402-59171-0009.flac, in search of a ghost with its beard on fire. his critics often accuse him in regard to the invention of the shaw myth of having designed a poster rather than painted a portrait.
2804,7402-59171-0001.flac," and he does express an opinion on everything, without making a multitude of people shake their fists in an impotent anger. his life, at least his public life,"
2805,7402-59171-0028.flac," and the characterization in molière. in shaw's place, the characters are less representative of vices or passions than those of molière, and more representative of class, profession or sect."
2806,7402-59171-0044.flac," he sees current history from the absolutely opposite point of view, say, to the lyric poet."
2807,7402-59171-0031.flac, of force and so forth is a suggestive contribution to criticism. i am not sure that the comparison would not have been more effectively put in the chapter than a book.
2808,7402-59171-0033.flac, mr shaw is made an idol in spite of himself.
2809,7402-59171-0020.flac," without any admixture of humanity, repeating mr. shaw's opinion of the nature of the creed of artists. there is a similar falsification in the same play in the characterization of the newspaper man who is present at dubu.de."
2810,7402-59171-0026.flac, declear that bernard shaw does depict characters.
2811,7402-59171-0024.flac," the much more important character of bb, the soothing and incompetent doctor, is a creation of the true comic genius. nine people out of ten harp on mr. shaw's heirs."
2812,7402-59171-0041.flac," he does not hesitate to wound, and he does not hesitate to misunderstand, but he is free from malice. the geniality of his comedy, on the other hand, is often more offensive than malice."
2813,7402-59171-0037.flac," the defense of mr. shaw, however, does not depend on any real or imaginary resemblance of his plays to more years. his joy and his misery before the ludicrous spectacle of human life are his own, and his expression of them."
2814,7402-59171-0010.flac," stop advertising myself. on the contrary, i must do it more than ever. look at pear's soap. there is a solid house, if you like, but every wall is still plastered with their advertisements. if i were to give up advertising,"
2815,7402-90848-0009.flac," goodbye, bobo. cryed the assembled courteers, who were almost beside themselves with laughter at the simpleton and his errand. don't fail to bring back the lost half hour. so bobo rode over the hills and far away."
2816,7402-90848-0013.flac," answer me, you silly! have you seen a lost temper anywhere? it's about the size of a large melon and has sharp little points. on bobo's answering, no. this dreadful person uttered so perfectly awful a screech of rage."
2817,7402-90848-0014.flac," that bobo's horse took right and ran away with him. and it was all that bobo could do to rein him in three miles farther down the road. still farther along, bobo came to ziz, the capital city of the kingdom of the seven brooks, and was taken before the king himself."
2818,7402-90848-0010.flac," it was very dignified and wore torches show glasses. but bobo had to answer no and the old man wandered on again. another day the simpleton encountered a tall, dark, fierce kind of fellow."
2819,7402-90848-0012.flac, i'm looking for something i lost myself. i've lost my temper.
2820,7402-90848-0000.flac," once upon a time there was an old widow woman who had three sons. the first two were clever enough, but the third, bobo by name, was a little better than the silly simpleton. all his mother's scoldings and beatings"
2821,7402-90848-0048.flac," on the steps of one of the cottages, sat an old woman, all alone and weeping with all her might. what is the matter, my good woman, said the king."
2822,7402-90848-0040.flac," as for the missing daughter, she is the kitchen-made in princess senses palace, who is known as tilda. so, bobo thanked father time, and at noon,"
2823,7402-90848-0045.flac," in a word, the greatest novelman in all fairy land."
2824,7402-90848-0042.flac," when they got to the seashore, the white horse hesitated not an instant, but set foot upon the water, which bore him up as if it had been not water, but earth itself."
2825,7402-90848-0029.flac," a youth mounted on a splendid black horse and dashed at lightning speed out of the castle, and disappeared in the wood. an old man with a white beard accompanied by eleven young men, whom bovo judged from their expressions to be brothers,"
2826,7402-90848-0016.flac," and he continued his way on foot. three long years passed, and bobo grew into a handsome lad, but remained a simpleton still. finally, after he had wandered all about fairyland, he came to the edge of the sea."
2827,7402-90848-0030.flac," stood by the gate to see the horsemen ride away. plucking up courage, bobo came forward, fell on his knee before the old man, and told his story. truly, you should thank the storm fairy, said the old man."
2828,7402-90848-0005.flac," instead of laughing, little tilda would find him a glass of warm milk, hang his coat by the fire to dry, and tell him not to be such a simpleton again. thus, after a while,"
2829,7402-90848-0038.flac," and when bobo had drunk it, he was no longer a simpleton. and, being no longer a simpleton, he remembered the man who had lost his reputation, the man who had lost his temper, and the king whose daughter had been stolen by the fairies."
2830,7402-90848-0044.flac," the joy of the monarchy knew no bounds, and bobo, the one-time simpleton, became on the spot lord bobo of the sapphire hills. marky of the mountains of the moon, prince of the valley of goldapples,"
2831,7402-90848-0004.flac," everybody except little tilde, the kitchen made. when poor bobo used to return from some wild goose chase, tired out to mud-stained, and often enough wet to skin,"
2832,7402-90848-0062.flac," when the rejoicings were over,"
2833,7402-90848-0023.flac," so bovo sat down on the stone by the foot of the tree and put on the wooden shoes, which fitted him very nicely. now these shoes were magic shoes, and bovo had hardly stepped into them before they turned his feet inland."
2834,7402-90848-0060.flac," for the dragon had blown up. the lost temper had finished him. only one fragment of him, a tiny bit of a claw was ever found."
2835,7402-90848-0032.flac," they ride for an hour around the whole wide world. seven o'clock has just written forth. yes, you shall have the lost half hour, but you must look after my sunsources for the space of a whole year. to this?"
2836,7402-90848-0007.flac," shall we send bobo in search of the lost half hour, said the princess to the couriers? yes, yes, cried the couriers. bobo shall look for the lost half hour. i'll give him a horse, said one."
2837,7402-90848-0034.flac," he took such good care of the great black horses of the hours of the night, and the white horses of the hours of the day, that they were never more proud and strong, nor their coat smoother and more gleaming. when the year was up, bobble again, sought out father-time."
2838,7402-90848-0053.flac," and so it proved. in spite of his mad dash, bobo, who had spurred on ahead, arrived exactly half an hour late. the monstrous dragon, who had tilled in his claws,"
2839,7402-90848-0006.flac," one pleasant midsummer morning, when bobo had been nearly a year at the castle, princess zenza overslept half an hour and did not come down to breakfast at the usual time. when she did get up, she found her court waiting for her in the castle gardens."
2840,7402-90848-0031.flac," for had you not been wrecked upon the silent, never would you have discovered the lost half-hour. i, and father time himself, and these are my twelve sons, the hours. every day, one after the other,"
2841,7402-90848-0052.flac," quick, quick, cried the king and bobo in the same breath. let us hurry to the castle, we may save her yet. but they knew in their hearts that they were too late. and that poor tilled had given herself to the dragon."
2842,7402-90848-0049.flac, evil days have fallen upon our unhappy kingdom. three days ago a terrible dragon lighted in the garrings of the palace and sent word to princess zenza that if within three days she did not provide him with someone brave enough to go home with him and cook his meals.
2843,7402-90848-0019.flac," and was wrecked upon a mysterious island of rocks that shone in the night like wet matches. a great wave swept the decks, and bobo was born away from his companions and carried toward the shining land."
2844,7402-90848-0061.flac," the grand cross of the order of the black cat was conferred upon bobo by princess zenza, who also asked his pardon for having treated him so shabby. this bobo gave readily."
2845,7402-90848-0015.flac," here, the four-old king took out a great green handkerchief and wipeed his eyes. she was stolen by the fairies on mid-summery 15 years ago. find her worthy bobo, and an immense reward will be yours."
2846,7402-90848-0003.flac," now he would be sent to find a white craws feather or a spray of yellow blue bells. now he was ordered to look for a square wheel or a glass of dry water. everybody laughed at him and made fun of him. that is,"
2847,7402-90848-0055.flac," as for the sun itself, turning around like a cartwheel and hissing like 10,000 rockets, it rolled back along the sky to the east. the hands of the clocks, which marta fast to, were to back to to a clock in a twinkling."
2848,7402-90848-0058.flac," angered by the sight of bobo and his drawn sword, he roared angrily, but continued to approach. bobo struck at him with his sword. the blade broke upon his steely scales. the dragon roared again. now."
2849,7402-90848-0051.flac," that we are mourning. at two o'clock she is to be carried off by the dragon. it is almost two now. alas, alas! hardly were the words out of her mouth when the town bell struck twice solemnly and sadly."
2850,7402-90848-0050.flac," and keep his cavern tidy, he would burn our fields with his fiery breath. yet who i ask you would be housekeeper for a dragon?"
2851,7402-90848-0039.flac," till the first, said father time, that his reputation has been broken into a thousand pieces, which have been picked up by his neighbors and carried home. if he can persuade his neighbors to give them up,"
2852,7402-90848-0057.flac," the dragon was advancing toward her. bobo ran down into the field and stood beside zelda, ready to defend her to the end. the dragon came nearer and nearer. suddenly,"
2853,7402-90848-0024.flac," so, bobo obediently let the shoes guide him. at corners the shoes always turned in the right direction, and if bobo forgot and blundered on the wrong way, the shoes swiftly began to pinch his toes."
2854,7402-90848-0036.flac," don't try to peek at it or open the box until the right time has come. if you do, the half hour will fly away and disappear forever. farewell, bobo, said a kind young 12 o'clock who had been the simpleton's good friend."
2855,7402-90848-0037.flac," i too have a gift for thee. drink this cup of water to the last drop, and the youth handed the simpleton a silver cup full to the brim of clear shining water. now this water was the water of wisdom."
2856,7402-90848-0043.flac," bubbo, with great goodness of heart, took along this extraordinary object in the hope of finding its angry possessor. father on the lad encountered till his father, the unhappy king, and delivered his message."
2857,7402-90848-0001.flac," and she smacked the poor lad's soundly a dozen times a day, did him no good, whatever. now it came to pass that one morning princess zenza, the ruler of the land, happened to pass by the cottage and heard bobo being given a terrible tongue-lashing."
2858,7402-90848-0026.flac," and as that day was drawing to a close, turrets of a magnificent castle rose far away over the leaves of the forest. bobo arrived at twilight."
2859,7402-90848-0027.flac," he found himself in a beautiful garden lying between the castle walls and the rising slopes of a great mountain. dranged to say, not a living creature was to be seen, and though there were lights in the castle,"
2860,7402-90848-0035.flac," you have served faithfully and well,"" said father time. here is your reward. and, with these words, he placed in bobo sands a small square casket made of ebony. the half hour lies inside."
2861,7402-90848-0025.flac," for two days bobo walked inland toward the great mountain. a warm wind blew the clouds and rain away. the sun shone sweet and clear. on the morning of the third day, the simpleton entered a wood of tall silent trees."
2862,7402-90848-0054.flac, thing should be exactly as they were half an hour before. he opened the cover of the ebony box. something like a winged white flame escapes from it and flew hissing through the air to the sun.
2863,7402-90848-0021.flac," looking about, bobo found himself on a lovely island, whose heart was a high mountain mass, hidden in the fog still sweeping in from the sea. there was not a house, a road, or a path to be seen."
2864,7402-90848-0041.flac," 12 o'clock placed him behind him on the white charger and hurried away. so fast they flew that bobo, who was holding the ebony casket close against his heart, was in great danger of falling off."
2865,7402-90848-0018.flac," so, bobo went aboard the ship and sailed out upon the dark sea. for two days the weather was warm and clear, but on the third day there came a dreadful storm, and on the third night the vessel was driven far off her course into the unknown ocean."
2866,7402-90848-0047.flac," and the breastplate to the armed men shining in the sun. after a week of almost constant progress for the king was so anxious to see his beloved daughter that he would hardly give the cavalcade times rest,"
2867,7402-90848-0017.flac," although as the sailors if they had seen, a lost half hour. no, said the sailors, but we are going to the isles of iron. suppose you go with us, the lost half hour may be there."
2868,7402-90848-0008.flac," when he returned. the good kitchen-made said little, for she feared less some misadventure overtake the poor simpleton, but when the chief cook wasn't looking, she took the fresh current bun into bobo's pocket,"
2869,7402-90848-0002.flac," curious as to the cause of all the noise, the princess drew rain and seven bovaux's mother to come near. on hearing her story, it occurred to the princess that so silly a lad might amuse her."
2870,7402-90848-0022.flac," in which were a pair of wooden shoes. above the shoes was a card, saying simply,"
2871,7402-90848-0028.flac," there was not even a water at the gate. suddenly a great booming bell struck seven o'clock. bobo began to hear voices and sounds, and then before the humming of the bell had died away,"
2872,7402-90848-0020.flac," though pounded and battered by the foaming waves, the simpleton at length managed to reach the beach, and took refuge in a crevice of the cliff during the stormy night. when the dawn broke, all sign of the ship had disappeared."
2873,7402-90848-0033.flac," bumble willingly agreed. so 12 o'clock, who was the youngest of the hours, took him to the stables and showed him the little room in the turret that he was to have."
2874,7402-90848-0059.flac," just as the dragon's mouth was its widest, bobo, who had been searching his pocket desperately, hurled into it the lost temper. there was a perfectly terrific bang as if a million balloons had blown up all at once."
2875,7402-90848-0046.flac," all in splendid silks and soldiers in shining armor, the delighted king wrote off to claim his missing daughter from princess sensor. so on they wrote, the harnesses jingling, the bridal bells ringing,"
2876,7402-90848-0011.flac," who answered his polite question with a scream of rage. a half hour, he roared. no, i haven't seen your half hour. i wouldn't tell you if i had. what's more, i don't want to see it."
2877,7402-90848-0056.flac," and, sure enough, there was brave little tilde standing alone in a great field, waiting for the dragon to come and take her away. lumbering heavily along like a monstrous turtle and snorting blue smoke."
2878,8747-293952-0090.flac," luckily, alice was out of the way, having gone to pay a visit. but she was expected back momentarily, and miss barengerio wished to get rid of julius before the girl returned. she might be able to conceal her real feelings, but"
2879,8747-293952-0058.flac," i will no longer be bound to you. i never loved you. but i've always tried to see the best side of you. but you have no good side. you're a mean, cowardly serpent. and if bernard is alive, i shall do my best to defend him."
2880,8747-293952-0010.flac," he was naturally very pleased and was very attentive. a complete rest is what you need, he said to miss randolph."
2881,8747-293952-0104.flac," i can vouch for his honesty,"" he said. but he talks too much. he must hold his tongue here,"" said the old damn civilians shaking her trowel at the boy. where is clothes? i have none but what's on, cried jerry."
2882,8747-293952-0029.flac," why did you accept me then? what else could i do? it was sir simon's wish that we should marry, and owing to my circumstances, i had no choice in the matter. during his life i was merely a puppet."
2883,8747-293952-0087.flac," on durham and on alice mallison. for this last reason, he was introducing him into the house. if bernard were alive, as julius began to suspect, he would come to one of these three people, and then jerry would at once become aware of the fact."
2884,8747-293952-0086.flac," i'm fly,"" said master moon, and began whistling. julius looked at him with satisfaction. he intended that the boy should remain in the neighborhood so as to keep watch on coniston."
2885,8747-293952-0097.flac," it is not to lord conestant's credit. but i must know the reason said the old damn sharply, if you want me to take the lad into my service. jerry, an answer to a look of barrels, began to weep ostentatiously."
2886,8747-293952-0024.flac," poor bernard's death has shaken me. it is just as well he did die though. i have been saying that said pain, but i must take my leave. i will come and see you again, miss randolph, and remember what i told you."
2887,8747-293952-0028.flac," if we ever do, mary said julius gloomly. so far as i'm concerned, i should like to break the engagement, julius. we were never suited to one another. barrel's vanity was hurt."
2888,8747-293952-0065.flac," and then it depends upon him whether he is hanged or prefers to live abroad on a portion of his money. the lesser portion, i know the price of your silence, said lucy, vehemently. you will want the hall and a large income."
2889,8747-293952-0102.flac," yes, sweet lady. don't talk like that child. call me ma'am."
2890,8747-293952-0036.flac," there is always a chance that he may have escaped. i sincerely trust not. are you always hated bernard? on the contrary, i speak for his good."
2891,8747-293952-0000.flac, things went very smoothly at gore hall after durham had established lucy as its mistress during the absence of bernard. the girl herself firmly believed that her cousin was dead and assumed deep mourning.
2892,8747-293952-0023.flac," in schoolboy phrase, a sneak. i am just going, mr. barrow. are you ill, lucy? asked barrow with affection. i have an attack of nerves, she replied petishly."
2893,8747-293952-0026.flac," why do you think bernard is innocent, he asked? because if he is guilty, his action gives the lie to his whole life, julius. she replied, raising herself on her elbow, i can't believe he killed my uncle."
2894,8747-293952-0092.flac," he's a lad, i wish you to help,"" said barrel blendley. last time we met miss plantagenet, you mentioned that you wanted a page. not exactly a page, said the old dame, rubbiner nose."
2895,8747-293952-0004.flac," knowing that she had married walter gore, and although there was a flaw in the circumstances upon which she built her claim, yet she trusted to her own cleverness to conceal this, from the two clever lawyer. but apart from this,"
2896,8747-293952-0085.flac," and dull said, jerry, putting his hands in his pockets, lord, what a bore stopping with her will be. but i can nip over and see victoria when i like, and keep an eye on lord coniston as i told you."
2897,8747-293952-0073.flac," i am free now. free,"" she said, stretching her hands. oh, what an escape i have had from that wicked man. he is shown his hand too plainly. i will put mr. durham on his guard and"
2898,8747-293952-0021.flac," but he could not always control it. and was a kind-hearted boy. he is innocent. i am sure. how are you sure, my dear lucy, asked a third voice, and she looked up to see julia standing in the doorway."
2899,8747-293952-0070.flac," but you go too fast, you can't yet prove that bernard lives. i go to do so, sneered julius, and bowed himself ironically out of the room, leaving lucy furious, both with him and with herself."
2900,8747-293952-0067.flac," you can tell him the whole of this conversation's gnarled barrel. i'm not afraid of durham. if bernard is alive, he'll have to pay up or be hanged. he is innocent."
2901,8747-293952-0027.flac," sir simon is not your uncle,"" said burrell gelously. you're only a distant relative. perhaps my marriage with you make me a newer one."""
2902,8747-293952-0095.flac," i lived with grandmother at cove castle. that's lord coniston's place,"" said miss beringaria, more perplex than ever. what were you doing there? i lived with grandmother. my name is jerry moon."
2903,8747-293952-0037.flac, what's the use of his coming to life when he must suffer for his crime?
2904,8747-293952-0016.flac," alice has such a tender heart. dr. pain was doubtful. so far as he saw, miss malison was remarkably cheerful under her sorrow. she is philosophic, miss randolph."
2905,8747-293952-0008.flac," she had hitherto done. no one could have been meeker, and although miss randolph did not like or trust the woman, she had no fault to find with her in any way. lucy suffered severely from the shock of her simon's tragic death."
2906,8747-293952-0046.flac, the boy told me himself. he will tell you if you like to see him. i don't want to see him. lord conniston is too kind of man to behave in that way. he was fond of bernard.
2907,8747-293952-0025.flac," rest and cheerful company, miss malacens for choice. he departed smiling, and they heard him gallop off, when the sound of the horses hoofs died away."
2908,8747-293952-0018.flac, poor alice. i wish bernard had lived.
2909,8747-293952-0041.flac," this boy is a grandson of lord conniston's housekeeper mrs. moon. at cove castle said lucy with some color interface, i know. do you know lord conniston as julius suspiciously? i've met him once."
2910,8747-293952-0099.flac," you should always hold your tongue,"" said miss barringaria angrily. you had no right to tell what lord conniston wished kept secret. it was only a freak on his part. he left the army at my request."
2911,8747-293952-0045.flac," misplentage in it once a page. i found this lad in london selling matches. he was a messenger boy at a tobacco nest called taberly, and lord coniston got him turned out of the situation."
2912,8747-293952-0061.flac," you take a high tone, he said sneeringly. but remember that if bernard is dead, the money goes to charities. so much the better, you do not get it. nor you either."
2913,8747-293952-0054.flac," and then, as lucy's starting up in facing barrel,"
2914,8747-293952-0005.flac," the fact that he suspected someone of passing himself off as bernard startled her and opened an abyss at her feet. on leaving the office, she judged it best to lower her crest for the moment and to wait patiently to see what would transpire."
2915,8747-293952-0014.flac," i never saw him or attached couple. did you ever meet him? once it misplentaginets. you know i'm great friends with the old lady? i often visit her, not professionally, for she is as healthy as a trout and a pond."
2916,8747-293952-0032.flac," no, bernard and i are like brother and sister, but he is dead."
2917,8747-293952-0093.flac," a sure sign she was perplexed. merely a boy to see after the fouls and to wait about the house when necessary. i love fouls, said jerry sweetly, and looking as innocent as a babe, and dogs and things like that."
2918,8747-293952-0062.flac," you will have to turn out of this luxurious home and live on the piton, sir simon left you. would i be better off if i married you? i think you would. i have not much money now, but i will have some."
2919,8747-293952-0011.flac," and i will give you a tonic. naturally, you suffer from the terrible circumstances of sir simon's death. he thought a moment."
2920,8747-293952-0060.flac," i give you back your ring. here it is. she wrenched it from her finger. now leave the house, mr. barrel. i am mistress here. julius looked at the ring which she had thrown at his feet and laughed."
2921,8747-293952-0050.flac, let us see if you can find out from lord coniston or durham that bernard is alive. let me know and i'll see what i can do to help him. how can you help him when you believe him guilty? i might help him to escape.
2922,8747-293952-0007.flac," for one failure. as it was, she came back to the hall and behaved herself much better than she'd ever done before. she was respectful to lucy and did not display her impatience of commands that"
2923,8747-293952-0053.flac," they will find it difficult to prove that, sneered barrel with a white face. i believe the fellow is alive after all."
2924,8747-293952-0069.flac," which ever it is, joy of a spitfire. and an honest woman,"" said miss randolph, wrathfully, for the reference to conniston touched her nearly."
2925,8747-293952-0003.flac, she saw that she had gone too far and had given durham and the inkling as to the possibility of michael having masqueraded as bernard.
2926,8747-293952-0084.flac," you know nothing about such things corrected the respectable mr. barrel severely. i know a jolly sight more than you think, said the archon under his breath and producing a cigarette. julius took it from him."
2927,8747-293952-0020.flac, i do not believe he was.
2928,8747-293952-0076.flac," he laughed and looked at the small boy trotting beside him. i'm equal to both. the boy was a handsome, innocent looking little fellow, rather undersized."
2929,8747-293952-0103.flac," mr. barrel, such a kind gentleman. ma'am said you would help me. i will so long as you are honest. jerry thrust his tongue in his cheek, but julius answered."
2930,8747-293952-0022.flac," he came forward. forgive me if i heard a few words of your conversation, but i have just come in, dr. pain. i hope i see you well."" quite well said the doctor who did not like barrel, thinking him"
2931,8747-293952-0013.flac," probably, but she bears up wonderfully, but that she is in mourning one would hardly guess she has sustained such a loss. was she very much attached to mr. gore? yes."
2932,8747-293952-0031.flac," you told sir simon about bernard being in love with alice, that the poor boy might be disinherited. barrel did not deny the charge. i believe you are in love with bernard yourself, he said."
2933,8747-293952-0042.flac," he seems to be a most delightful fellow. what a delightful speech for a lady, said burrow. coniston is a scamp. i heard he enlisted in the lancers. it shows how brave he is, every man worth calling a man."
2934,8747-293952-0039.flac," i am not hard-hearted, snap-barrel. i always do good."
2935,8747-293952-0072.flac," for conniston was one of those irresistible men who appealed to women. lucy thought, but it matters little what she thought. all she knew was that her engagement to julius, which had always weighed on her conscience, was at an end."
2936,8747-293952-0074.flac," here she blushed, and lord coniston. julius walking towards the bower was also angry with himself. as lucy thought, he'd shown his hand too clearly."
2937,8747-293952-0043.flac," she'd go to the front. perhaps you would like me to go, snier julius? you would never have the pluck,"" said lucy quickly. all your ends in life are gained by cunning."
2938,8747-293952-0035.flac," mr. durham requires proof of the death rejoin lucy sharply, and until then he is bound to administer the estate according to the will, as bernard's body is not been found."
2939,8747-293952-0096.flac," his lordship got me a situation in an added-to-backeness, said the child like moon, and then he got me turned off. why? that's not like lord coniston?"
2940,8747-293952-0017.flac," i think, however, if you would have her over to see you, it would do both her and yourself good. i shall write a note to her today, sid lucy. i'm very fond of her, and we get on very well together."
2941,8747-293952-0051.flac," i don't want to see him hanged. he won't be hanged if lord conniston and mr. durham can save him. ah, julius started to his feet. then he is alive."
2942,8747-293952-0049.flac," and i believe bernard may be alive after all. in which case, you would give him up to the police. no, said julius with an emotion which didn't, him credit? i should never betray him."
2943,8747-293952-0019.flac," rising to take his leave. if he was guilty, ah said lucy, raising herself with animation from the sofa upon which she was lying. if he was guilty,"
2944,8747-293952-0030.flac, although you swore for an hour.
2945,8747-293952-0055.flac," ah, you would make him pay money to save himself. i have a right to a portion of the estate. you have not,"" said miss randolph, clenching her fists and all of her langour gone. bernard is the owner of gore hall."
2946,8747-293952-0078.flac," but his mind had not yet had time to work on his face, and the mask of his childhood, for he was only 13, concealed his evil nature successfully. in a few years, when his passions worked their way through the mask, his face,"
2947,8747-293952-0047.flac," and that makes him perfect in your eyes,"" said barrel, looking savage. see here lucy, coniston has left the army. so you see he's not so brave as you think."
2948,8747-293952-0082.flac," they think i'm a kind of holy bill, and i let him think so. it pays. jerry, you are a young scamp of the worst. the boy chuckled as though he had received a compliment. i like doing things, he explained, frankly. it's fun."
2949,8747-293952-0109.flac, then he took his leave and the old lady watched him go.
2950,8747-293952-0034.flac," he must know that bernard is dead, seeing that the coat and hat were found on the banks of the river. no man could have lived in the cold in the fog. yet if durham was sure, he would not hold the estate against bernard's coming."
2951,8747-293952-0105.flac," the kind gentleman got them for me, ma'am. you were a better christian than i thought, said miss beringaria, looking at beryl. well, you can stay here, boy. go to the kitchen and tell the servants to give you something to eat."
2952,8747-293952-0089.flac," and but for the sake of alice she would have refused to let him enter the bauer. as it was, and with great diplomacy, so great that it deceived even the astute barrel, she asked him to come into the house."
2953,8747-293952-0091.flac," alice being so young and impulsive might show her dislike too plainly and put barrel on his guard. who is this you have here, asked miss plantagenet, putting on her spectacles and surveying jerry with admiration? what a pretty lad!"
2954,8747-293952-0071.flac," she was angry with herself because she felt that in speaking of conistence she had colored. and as a matter of fact, she greatly admired the young lord, even though they had only met once."
2955,8747-293952-0079.flac," would be wrinkled and sinful. his mind would have marked plainly its signet on the smooth surface. but at present he looked charmingly innocent, although he already knew much more about life than was good for him."
2956,8747-293952-0080.flac," julius, in order that the lad might make an impression on miss plantagenet, had dressed him in a new suit, and pleased with himself, for much of the boy remained in this percusious criminal. young jerry trotted along smiling."
2957,8747-293952-0108.flac," i must see that he doesn't swear or smoker indulge in any of those wicked things. i hope he will do your recommendation, credit, mr. barrel."" i hope he will, said julius, and felt a strong inclination."
2958,8747-293952-0002.flac," but now that she tasted the sweets of power, she was not disposed to allow julius to treat her as he chose. mrs. gilroy came back from her visit to the lawyer."
2959,8747-293952-0056.flac," end of all the property, end of the title also."
2960,8747-293952-0106.flac," jerry grandan duck towards the door. goodbye jerry said barrel kindly. don't forget me. if i do may i be, oh no, kind lady, i mean, ma'am, i won't swear."
2961,8747-293952-0101.flac, but turn the conversation defiantly.
2962,8747-293952-0038.flac," you have no grounds for saying that, said julius, pale with rage. i don't need grounds reported the genuine woman. bernard always was a kindhearted as you were, and are the reverse."
2963,8747-293952-0033.flac," lucy sat up on the sofa and pushed the loose hair back from her forehead. why do you say that, she asked sharply. julius stared at the fire. i can't understand durham's attitude, he said evacively."
2964,8747-293952-0100.flac," at your request, said julius, looking at her directly. for armed as she was, miss verangaria, with the consciousness of bernard's secret, flushed through her weathered skin."
2965,8747-293952-0066.flac," all i can get, rejoin, barrel quietly, and you have refused to share my fortune with me. yes, i will have nothing to do with you, and remember that if i catch you plotting, i will tell mr. durham."
2966,8747-293952-0107.flac," i never did having been to sunday school. yes, ma'am, i'm going. and jerry, an answer to an imperative wave of his new mistress's hand, disappeared. miss beringeri, it turned to barrel."
2967,8747-293952-0063.flac, a great deal someday. by black-mailing bernard said lucian dignately. julius picked up the ring and slipped it into his waste-coast pocket calmly. we don't know that bernard is alive.
2968,8747-293952-0075.flac," it would have been better, he considered, to have held my tongue. i should have done so that she not goaded me into speech. she will tell durham and that interfering coniston and put them on their guard. well…"
2969,8747-293952-0094.flac," you seem a nice lad, who is he, mr. barrel? a poor boy who sold matches in london. but i didn't always pipe jerry, shifting from one leg to the other, and feigned embarrassment, and playing as part perfectly."
2970,8747-293952-0040.flac," not always, for instance, i'm down here to get a small boy opposed with misplentaginate as a page. that is very good of you, sid lucy, scornfully. ah, you see, i can do a kind action."
2971,8747-293952-0006.flac," mrs. gilroy was a well-educated woman and various due. therefore, she hoped to gain her ends by craft, if not by force. so far she had failed, but she did not intend to abandon her claim."
2972,8747-293952-0057.flac," his name will be cleared. and then you will throw me over and try to become lady gore. i throw you over now, said lucy, losing her temper and coloring hotly. how dare you speak to me like this, julius!"
2973,8747-293952-0059.flac," from your snares. but lucy, don't speak to me!"
2974,8747-293952-0001.flac," and felt his loss deeply. it was her outspoken affection that provoked a quarrel between her and julius, and which led to the breaking of their engagement. lucy had a high temper, which had been kept in subjection during the life of sir simon."
2975,8747-293952-0044.flac," lucy, if you talk to me like that, began barrow, and then restrained himself with an effort. it is no use or quarreling. let me show you that i am not so careless of others, or so hard-hearted as i seem to be."
2976,8747-293952-0098.flac," i saw his lordship dressed as a soldier, he snuffled. and i told mr. barrow, his lordship was so angry that he got me turned off, saying i was ungrateful."
2977,6925-80680-0058.flac," and strutted up and down in them, admiring herself in the mirrors that lined the room."
2978,6925-80680-0005.flac," mind you, declare that the king is right. it certainly was a jackal, but if we say so, the king will probably not keep his word about going away, and we shall get into trouble, so we had better take his side."" to this, the other agreed."
2979,6925-80680-0070.flac, then the princess sent for her father and told him that she wished to marry amir ali.
2980,6925-80680-0002.flac," if you thought it was anything but a jackal answered the queen. i say it was a tiger cried the king, don't contradict me. nonsense snapped the queen. it was a jackal. and the dispute waxed so warm that the king said it last. very well."
2981,6925-80680-0022.flac," amir ali could think of no excuse by which to bring her back, and so with a heavy heart, he made his salutations and bade the old woman farewell. but when he had gone a little way, she called after him. if ever you are in trouble or danger,"
2982,6925-80680-0019.flac," and on reaching the spot, he found an ugly old woman streaming wet and crying loudly as she lifted from her head."
2983,6925-80680-0003.flac," we'll call the guard and ask, and if it was a jackal, i'll leave this kingdom to you and go away. and if it was a tiger, then you shall go, and i will marry a new wife."" as you like, answer the queen. there isn't any doubt which it was."
2984,6925-80680-0038.flac, but amir ali gave a sweep upwards with his sharp sword to cut the rope that she had slipped round his neck.
2985,6925-80680-0034.flac," but a horrid kind of witch who really lived in witchland and had no business on earth. if ever a man strayed into witchland, the ogresses used to eat him up, and this old witch thought she would like to catch a man for supper."
2986,6925-80680-0007.flac, and away the bearers went for three days and three nights until they came to a dense wood.
2987,6925-80680-0027.flac," soon after this, on a dark and stormy night, when the river roared beneath the palace walls, the sound of a woman weeping and whaling was heard above the storm. the king ordered a servant to go and see what was the matter, but the servant, falling on his knees and terror."
2988,6925-80680-0061.flac," and then she declared to her father that, unless she had bracelets and necklace to match the anklets she would die. again the king sent for amir ali and ordered him to get an necklace and bracelets to match those anklets within a month, or be put to a cruel death."
2989,6925-80680-0021.flac," and as they drew near it, amir ali beheld in the doorway the loveliest damsel his eyes had ever looked on. at the sight of a stranger, she drew her veil about her and stepped into the hut. and, much as he wished to see her again,"
2990,6925-80680-0046.flac, or she would die of shame. so the king sent for amir ali.
2991,6925-80680-0044.flac," that was the parrot's name. how do you think the princess looks in her new jewel? think, snap the parrot, who was cross, because they hadn't given him his bath that morning. i think she looks like a washer woman's daughter, with one shoe on and the other off."
2992,6925-80680-0041.flac," a myralee himself was astonished. for he had slipped the anklad into his pocket in the dark and had not looked at it since. the king was delighted at its beauty, and having praised and rewarded a myralee, he gave the anklad to his daughter, a proud and spoiled princess."
2993,6925-80680-0014.flac," very few ever came near them, and the prince was continually begging his mother and the farmer to be allowed to go away and seek adventures and to make his own living. but she and the wise farmer always counseled him to wait until..."
2994,6925-80680-0060.flac, she looks more than ever like the washerwoman's daughter dressed up. poor princess. she wept and stormed and raved until she made herself quite ill.
2995,6925-80680-0076.flac," well, haysin then said the king, i have no time to waste. your majesty, said the farmer, has now lived and administered justice long in this city."
2996,6925-80680-0000.flac," one hot night in hindustan, a king and queen lay awake in the palace in the midst of the city. every now and then a faint air blew through the lattice, and they hoped they were going to sleep, but they never did. presently they became more broad awake than ever,"
2997,6925-80680-0077.flac, whilst jackals hunt in every place where there is something to be picked up.
2998,6925-80680-0075.flac," who thought that they had as good a chance as anyone else to gain both the throne and the princess. as soon as the king was seated, he called upon an usher to summon the first claimant, but just then a farmer who stood in front of the crowd cried out that he had a petition to offer."
2999,6925-80680-0039.flac, and with a yell of pain and anger she vanished into the darkness. amir ali then sat down to collect himself a little and felt upon the ground by his side an enclet that had evidently fallen off the old witch's foot.
3000,6925-80680-0025.flac, the king said he had plenty of servants and wanted no more.
3001,6925-80680-0032.flac, whilst from the foot of it came the sound of sobbing that the king had heard.
3002,6925-80680-0052.flac," and hold it over the cauldron, and every drop of blood that falls from it into the water will become a jewel. next, you must change the wands so that the one that stood at my head is at my feet, and then one at my feet stands at my head, and place the severed foot against the wound, and it will heal."
3003,6925-80680-0063.flac," once more, the beautiful maiden appeared at his summons and asked what he wanted."
3004,6925-80680-0008.flac," and started home again. now the queen thought to herself that the king could not mean to send her away for good, and that as soon as he had got over his fit of temper he would summon her back. so she stayed quite still for a long time, listening with all her ears for approaching footsteps."
3005,6925-80680-0064.flac," and her head. her words turned amir ali pale with horror, but she reminded him that no harm had come to her before, and at last he consented to do as she bade him."
3006,6925-80680-0043.flac," walking grandly about with her treasure tied around her ankle, she heard the starling say to the parrot."
3007,6925-80680-0023.flac," come to where you now stand and cry, fairy of the forest, fairy of the forest help me now. and i will listen to you."" the prince thanked her and continued his journey, but he thought little of the old woman's sane and much of the lovely damsel."
3008,6925-80680-0059.flac," and never recovered his temper until after lunch. she's got all her beauty at one end of her now. if she had a few of those fine goo-gaws around her neck and wrists she would look better. but now, to my mind,"
3009,6925-80680-0069.flac," how do you think our princess is looking now? a very fine, no doubt grumbled the parrot. but what is the use of dressing up like that for oneself only? she ought to have a husband. why doesn't she marry the man who got her all these splendid things?"
3010,6925-80680-0053.flac," and i shall become quite well again as before. at first,"
3011,6925-80680-0004.flac," so the king called the two soldiers who were on guard outside and put the question to them. but whilst the dispute was going on, the king and queen had got so excited and talked so loud that the guards had heard nearly all they said and one man observed to the other."
3012,6925-80680-0055.flac," and he saw each turn in the water into shining gems, his heart took courage. very soon there were plenty of jewels in the cauldron, and he quickly changed the wands, placed the severed foot against the wound, and immediately the two parts became one as before."
3013,6925-80680-0010.flac," but although the queen's eyes wandered in all directions, there was no sign of any human being. then her spirit gave way, and she began to cry. it so happened that close to the spot where the queen's palanquin had been set down, there dwelt a man who had a tiny farm in the midst of the forest."
3014,6925-80680-0071.flac, so the king sent for amir ali and told him that within a month he proposed to do him the honor of marrying him to the princess and making him heir to the throne.
3015,6925-80680-0042.flac," now, in the women's apartments in the palace, they're hung two cages, in one of which was a parrot and in the other a starling, and these two birds could talk as well as human beings. they were both pets of the princess who always fed them herself and the next day as she was."
3016,6925-80680-0009.flac," but heard none. after a while she grew nervous, for she was all alone and put her head out of the palinquin and looked about her. day was just breaking and birds and insects were beginning to stir."
3017,6925-80680-0057.flac," but three rare and beautiful anchorts, and these he duly presented to the king on the very day that his month of grace was over. the king embraced him warmly and made him rich gifts, and the next day the vain princess put two anchorts on each foot."
3018,6925-80680-0079.flac," to mistake the howl of a jackal for the hunting cry of a tiger. the king turned first red, and then pale. there is continued the farmer a royal tiger bred in the forest who has the first and only true claim to your throne. where?"
3019,6925-80680-0062.flac," and again, amir ali spent nearly the whole month searching for the jewels but all in vain. at length he made his way to the hut in the forest and stood and cried, ""'fairy of the forest! fairy of the forest! help me!'"
3020,6925-80680-0035.flac," in hopes that someone out of pity might come to her rescue. so when amir ali questioned her, she replied, ah, kind sir, it is my poor son who hangs upon that gallows. help me to get him down, and i will bless you forever."""
3021,6925-80680-0013.flac," years passed without a sign from the king. his wife might have been dead for all he seemed to care, though the queen still lived with the farmer, and the little prince had by this time grown up into a strong, handsome, and healthy youth. out in the forest they seemed far from the world."
3022,6925-80680-0024.flac," shortly afterwards, he arrived at a city, and as he was now in great straits."
3023,6925-80680-0001.flac," at the sound of a howl outside the palace. listen to that tiger, remarked the king. tiger replied the queen. how should there be a tiger inside the city? it was only a jackal. ""'i tell you it was a tiger,' said the king. ""'and i tell you that you were dreaming.'"
3024,6925-80680-0050.flac," then they appeared in the doorway the beautiful girl he had seen before, whom in all his wanderings he had never forgotten. what is the matter, she asked, in a voice so soft that he listened like one struck dumb."
3025,6925-80680-0020.flac," the old woman's face brightened. she showed him where to seek the water, and when he returned a few minutes later with his pot filled to the brim, she led the way without a word, and he followed. in a short while, they came to a hut in the forest."
3026,6925-80680-0018.flac," presently, as he made his way through a thicket, he saw a pigeon which he thought would make a good dinner, so he fired a pellet at it from his galale, but missed the pigeon which fluttered away with a startled clatter. at the same instant, he heard a great clamor from the on of the thicket,"
3027,6925-80680-0048.flac," and inquired of everyone where the finest jewels were to be got. but though he sought night and day, he never found one to compare with the anklad. at last, only a week remained, and he was in sore difficulty when he remembered the ferry of the forest."
3028,6925-80680-0049.flac," therefore, away he went, and after a day's traveling he reached the cottage in the forest, and, standing where he had stood, when the old woman called to him, he cried. fairy of the forest? fairy of the forest! help me! help me!"
3029,6925-80680-0051.flac," then he told her his story, and she went within the cottage and came back with two wands and a pot of boiling water. the two wands she planted in the ground about six feet apart, and then turned into him, she said."
3030,6925-80680-0012.flac," and when she had told her story, the farmer called his wife who led her to their house and gave her food to eat and a bed to lie on. and in the farm, a few days later a little prince was born and by his mother's wish named amir ali."
3031,6925-80680-0033.flac," or of the roaring river. as for ghosts and witches, they had never troubled him, so he walked up towards the gallows where crouched the figure of the woman. what ails you, he said. now the woman was not really a woman at all."
3032,6925-80680-0036.flac, amir ali thought that her voice sounded rather eager.
3033,6925-80680-0081.flac," then the farmer told the king and his ministers how he had rescued the queen and brought up amir ali, and he fetched the old queen herself whom he had left outside. at the sight of her the king was filled with shame and self-reproach, and wished he could have lived his life over again."
3034,6925-80680-0045.flac," why doesn't she wear two of them instead of going about with one leg adorned on the other empty? when the princess heard this, she burst into tears and, sending for her father,"
3035,6925-80680-0040.flac," and as the storm had by this time passed over, he made his way back to the palace. when he had finished his story, he took the enclot out of his pocket and handed it to the king, who, like everyone else, was amazed at the glory of the jewels which composed it. indeed,"
3036,6925-80680-0085.flac," she smiles at him and says, is it the tiger then or the jackal?"
3037,6925-80680-0074.flac," so he sent forth heralds throughout the neighboring countries, proclaiming that on a certain day any person fitted for a bridegroom and heir to the throne should present himself at the palace. when the day came, all the court were gathered together, and a great crowd assembled of men, young and old."
3038,6925-80680-0080.flac," growing pale as he listened. in prison replied the farmer, if your majesty will clear this court of the jackals, i will explain. clear the court, commanded the king, and very unwillingly the visitors left the palace. now,"
3039,6925-80680-0006.flac," the king made no remark, but sent for a palinquin and ordered the queen to be placed in it, bidding the four bearers of the palinquin to take her a long way off into the forest and there leave her. in spite of her tears, she was forced to obey."
3040,6925-80680-0030.flac," but he made his way down to the ford under the palace walls and stepped into the flooded water. inch by inch, and foot by foot he fought his way across, now nearly swept off his feet by some sudden swirl or eddy, now narrowly escaping,"
3041,6925-80680-0083.flac," there is only one person i will marry,"" said he, and this time the maiden did not run away, but agreed to be his wife. so the two were married without delay and lived long and reigned happily. as for the old woman whose picture amir ali had broken,"
3042,6925-80680-0078.flac," no, your majesty answered the farmer. i would only remind your majesty that there are plenty of jackals gathered today to try and claim your daughter and kingdom. every city has sent them, and they wait hungry and eager. but do not, o king, mistake or pretend again."
3043,6925-80680-0065.flac," from her severed hands and head, their fell into the cauldron, bracelets and chains of rubies and diamonds."
3044,6925-80680-0016.flac," a big brass pot to hold water, a few pieces of silver,"
3045,6925-80680-0084.flac," she was the forest maiden's fairy godmother, and when she was no longer needed to look after the girl, she gladly returned to fairyland. the old king has never been heard to contradict his wife anymore. if he even looks as if it does not agree with her,"
3046,6925-80680-0072.flac," amiralee bowed low and answered that he had done and would do. the king all the service that lay in his power saved only this one thing. the king, who considered his daughter's hand a prize for any man, flew into a passion, and the princess was more furious still."
3047,6925-80680-0047.flac," or he should be hanged for the princess would certainly die of disappointment. pura mirali was greatly troubled at the king's command, but he thought to himself that he had at any rate a month in which to lay his plans. he left the palace at once,"
3048,6925-80680-0015.flac," at last, when he was 18 years of age, they had not the heart to forbid him any longer."
3049,6925-80680-0031.flac," being caught in the branches of some floating tree that came tossing and swinging down the stream. at length he emerged, panting and dripping wet on the other side, close by the bank stood a gallows, and on the gallows hung the body of some evil doer,"
3050,6925-80680-0066.flac," then the head and hands were joined onto the body and left neither sign nor scar. full of gratitude, amir ali tried to speak to her, but she ran into the house and would not come back. and he was forced to leave her."
3051,6925-80680-0056.flac," then the maiden opened her eyes, sprang to her feet, and drawing her veil about her ran into the hut, and would not come out or speak to him anymore."
3052,6925-80680-0011.flac," where he and his wife lived alone far from any neighbors. as it was hot weather, the farmer had been sleeping on the flat roof of his house, but was awakened by the sound of weeping. he jumped up and ran downstairs as fast as he could, and into the forest towards the place the sound came from."
3053,6925-80680-0028.flac," begged that he might not be sent on such an errand, particularly on a night so wild, when evil spirits and witches were sure to be abroad. indeed, so frightened was he that the king, who was very kind-hearted, bade another to go in his stead."
3054,6925-80680-0026.flac," and promised that he should enter his bodyguard on the condition that he would undertake any service which was especially difficult or dangerous. this is just what amir ali wanted, and he agreed to do whatever the king might wish."
3055,6925-80680-0073.flac," amir ali was instantly thrown into the most dismal prison that they could find, and ordered to be kept there until the king had time to think in what way he should be put to death. meanwhile, the king determined that the princess ought in any case to be married without delay."
3056,6925-80680-0082.flac," and not have married the mother of the proud princess who caused him endless trouble until her death. my day is past,"" said he, and he gave up his crown to his son, amir ali, who went once more and called to the forest ferry to provide him with a queen to share his throne."
3057,6925-80680-0037.flac," and bent so that the old woman could clam around to his back, which she did very nimble. then suddenly he felt a noose slipped over his neck."
3058,6925-80680-0054.flac," at length, she persuaded him to do her bidding. he nearly fainted himself with horror when he found that, after the cruel blow which lopped her foot off, she lay as one lifeless. but he held the severed foot over the cauldron, and as drops of blood fell from it."
3059,6925-80680-0067.flac," when, on the day appointed, amir ali produced a necklace and bracelets, each more beautiful and priceless than the last, the king's astonishment knew no bounds, and as for his daughter she was nearly mad with joy."
3060,6925-80680-0017.flac," many a weary mile he tramped day after day until one morning he saw before him just such a forest as that in which he had been born and bred and he stepped joyfully into it, like one who goes to meet an old friend."
3061,6925-80680-0029.flac," but each one showed the same strange fear. then amir ali stepped forward. this is my duty, your majesty,"" he said. i will go. the king nodded and off he went. the night was as dark as pitch."
3062,6925-80680-0068.flac," the very next morning she put on all her finery and thought that now at least that disagreeable parrot could find no fault with her appearance, and she listened eagerly when she heard the starling say,"
3063,7517-100442-0010.flac, there is only one profession to follow. the profession of bookstore clerk. to be behind a bookstore is indeed to see life. the fascination of it struck me suddenly.
3064,7517-100442-0003.flac," and lordly people like you and me, with a pint of cherry gin, is not this to follow the king of trades. someday i shall open a grocery shop, and you will find me in my spare evenings"
3065,7517-100442-0000.flac," at the bookstore. i have often longed to be a grocer. to be surrounded by so many interesting things, sardines, bottled raspberries,"
3066,7517-100442-0030.flac," one of our greatest soldiers. i thought of these things last monday, and definitely renounced the idea of becoming a grocer. and as i wandered around the bookstore, thinking,"
3067,7517-100442-0009.flac," i perceive now that i was over hasty in deciding to become a grocer. that is rather for one's old age, while one is young and interested in persons rather than in things."
3068,7517-100442-0033.flac," that an interesting article might be extracted from it, so i bought the book. unfortunately enough, i left it in the train before i had time to master it. i shall be at the bookstall next monday."
3069,7517-100442-0018.flac, the day can never be dull to the bookstore clerk. i imagine him assigning in his mind the right paper to each customer. this man will ask for golfing. wrong.
3070,7517-100442-0014.flac," with, among others, a middle-aged woman. as soon as we left liverpool street, she produced a bag of shrimps, grasped each individual intern firmly by the head and tail,"
3071,7517-100442-0002.flac," at one moment to walk up a ladder in search of nutmeg, at the next to dive under a counter in pursuit of cinnamon. to serve low girls,"
3072,7517-100442-0029.flac," of major general clement bulger, c.b. even then, the man behind the bookstall is not found wanting. if he is wrong the first time, he never fails to recover with his second. bulger, sir."
3073,7517-100442-0023.flac," rather overdoing the part. after which, he would hand over the winning post and the animal's friend to the pursuing detective in a sort of holy awe. what a life."
3074,7517-100442-0032.flac," such as have guided men along the path of truth since the beginning of the world, from what hoe she bumps to echtdien and more. the thought occurred to me."
3075,7517-100442-0001.flac," biscuits with sugar on the top, preserved ginger, hams, brawn under glass, everything in fact that makes life worth living."
3076,7517-100442-0028.flac," and even when one of those subtler characters draws near, about whom it is impossible to say immediately, whether they require a fountain pen with case or the life and letters."
3077,7517-100442-0022.flac," and they would be very rare, his faith in human nature would begin to ooze away. until all at once he would tell himself excitedly that the man was obviously an escaped criminal in disguise."
3078,7517-100442-0012.flac," yes, and he would know who bought all his papers and books and pamphlets, and to know this is to know something about the people in the world."
3079,7517-100442-0025.flac," he understands by now the type of man who wants to read up a few good jokes to tell them down at old robinson's, where he is going for the weekend. our bookstalk clerk doesn't wait to be asked."
3080,7517-100442-0006.flac," but no currents this evening. i beg you. yes, to be a grocer is to live well. but, after all, it is not to see life. a grocer is a poor person."
3081,7517-100442-0034.flac, and i shall have to buy another copy. that will be all right. you shant miss it. but i am wondering now what the bookstore clerk will make of me. a man who keeps on buying proverbs and maxims?
3082,7517-100442-0015.flac," and ate him. when she had finished, she emptied the ends out of the window, wiped her hands, and settled down comfortably to her paper. what paper? you'll never guess."
3083,7517-100442-0031.flac," i came across a little book, six pence and cloth, a shilling and leather, called proverbs and maxims. it contained some thousands of the best thoughts in all languages."
3084,7517-100442-0017.flac," conceive the holy joy of the bookstore clerk. as she and her bag of shrimps, yes, he could have told at once they were shrimps, approached and asked for the morning post."
3085,7517-100442-0005.flac," weed grocers only put the currents out for show, and so that we may run our fingers through them luxuriously when business is slack. i have a good line in shortbreads, madam, if i can find the box."
3086,7517-100442-0019.flac," he wants cage birds. that one over there wants the motor. ah well, the auto car. that's near enough. soon he would begin to know the different types. he would learn to distinguish"
3087,7517-100442-0027.flac," who is always losing his india rubber umbrella ring. halfway across the station he can see him, and he hastens to get a new card out in readiness. or we would let you have seven for six differences at a first-case pincer earthquake."
3088,7517-100442-0011.flac," last monday, and wondered who bought the tie clips. the answer came to me just as i got into my train. ask the man behind the bookstall. he would know."
3089,7517-100442-0008.flac," and to sell a man, potted lobster is not to have our fingers on his pulse. potted lobster does not define a man. all customers are alike to the grocer, provided their money is good."
3090,7517-100442-0026.flac," as soon as this gentleman approaches, he whips out the book, dusts it, and places it before the rack on tour. he recognizes also, at a glance, the sort of silly ass,"
3091,7517-100442-0016.flac, i shall have to tell you the morning post. now doesn't that give you the woman? the shrimps alone know. the paper alone know. but the two together.
3092,7517-100442-0020.flac," between the patrons of the dancing times and of the vote, the era and the athenaeum. delightful surprises would overwhelm him at intervals, as when..."
3093,7517-100442-0013.flac," you cannot tell a man by the lobster he eats, but you can tell something about him by the literature he reads. for instance, i once occupied a carriage on an eastern line"
3094,7517-100442-0021.flac," a red letter day in all the great stations, a gentleman in a check waste coat makes the double purchase of homer's penny stories and the spectator. on those occasions,"
3095,7517-100442-0007.flac," in as far as it is possible to a man who sells, both scented soap and pilchards would become narrow. we do not come into contact with the outside world much, save through the medium of potted lobster,"
3096,7517-100442-0004.flac," apron behind the counter. look out for the current in the window as you come in. i have an idea for something artistic in the way of patterns there, but as you love me, do not offer to buy any."
3097,7517-100442-0024.flac, but he has other things than papers to sell. he knows who buys those little six-pinnie books of funny stories. a problem which has often puzzled us others.
3098,7517-100437-0027.flac," and recommended it to kenneth graham. but perhaps i am wrong here, far i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance. nor, as i have already lamented, am i financially interested in its sale,"
3099,7517-100437-0000.flac," a household book. once on a time i discovered samuel butler, not the other two, but the one who wrote the way of all flesh, the second best novel in the english language."
3100,7517-100437-0021.flac, whether it is well-known or not. it is the amazing truth that none of those hundreds had heard of the wind in the willows until i told them about it.
3101,7517-100437-0019.flac," my answer to the question whether i had anything to say would be, well, my lord, if i might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving. mr. justice darling."
3102,7517-100437-0025.flac," nonetheless, that your thanks were due. for instance, you may have noticed a couple of casual references to it, as if it were a classic known to all, in a famous novel."
3103,7517-100437-0033.flac," but i must give you one word of warning. when you sit down to it, don't be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgment on my taste."
3104,7517-100437-0012.flac," but when i ask you if you have read my book, you will profess surprise and say that you have never heard of it. is it as good as so and so, and such and such? you will ask."
3105,7517-100437-0006.flac," but i dare not risk it. the thought of your scorn at my previous ignorance of the world famous tillyay, your amused contempt, because i have only just succeeded"
3106,7517-100437-0029.flac," that it is what i call a household book. by a household book, i mean a book which everybody in the household loves and quotes continually ever afterwards. a book which is read aloud."
3107,7517-100437-0011.flac," of a well-known writer. when i tell you his name, you will say, oh yes, i love his books. and you will mention so and so, and it's equally famous sequel, such and such."
3108,7517-100437-0014.flac," i shall be quite content with your gratitude. well, the writer of my book is kenneth graham. you have heard of him? good, i thought so. the books you have read."
3109,7517-100437-0032.flac," when he wrote it. i hope this will please jones, were his final words, as he laid down his pen. well, of course, you will order the book at once."
3110,7517-100437-0013.flac," hardly believing that this could be possible. much better, i shall reply. and there, if these things were arranged properly, would be another 10% in my pocket. but believe me."
3111,7517-100437-0034.flac," still less on the genius of kenneth graham. you are merely sitting in judgment on yourself. you may be worthy, i do not know."
3112,7517-100437-0009.flac," who has not read it, in french or as i did in american. let us pass on to another book. for i am going to speak of another discovery."
3113,7517-100437-0004.flac, who wrote in the early part of last century a book called
3114,7517-100437-0005.flac," my uncle benjamin. i read it in the translation. eager as i am to be lyrical about it, i shall refrain. i think that i am probably safer with tillyet than with butler."
3115,7517-100437-0026.flac," published last year. it was i who introduced that novelist to it six months before. indeed, i feel sometimes that it was i who wrote the wind in the willows."
3116,7517-100437-0008.flac, who has not heard of claude tilly?
3117,7517-100437-0003.flac," in two glowing articles. not, unnaturally, the world remained unmoved. it knew all about samuel butler. last week, i discovered a frenchman."
3118,7517-100437-0022.flac," some of them had never heard of kenneth graham. well, one did not have to meet them again, and it takes all sorts to make a world. but most of them were in your position."
3119,7517-100437-0002.flac," well, i discovered him. just as voltaire discovered habakkuk, or your little boy discovered shakespeare the other day. and i committed my discovery to the world."
3120,7517-100437-0015.flac," are the golden age and dream days? am i not right? thank you. but the book you have not read, my book."
3121,7517-100437-0024.flac," for their gratitude. no doubt, they also spread the good news in their turn. and it is just possible that it reached you in this way. but it was to me"
3122,7517-100437-0010.flac," of a book which should be a classic, but is not, of a book of which nobody has heard, unless through me. it was published some 12 years ago, the last published book"
3123,7517-100437-0031.flac," who really appreciate it at its true value, and that the others are scarcely worthy of it? it is obvious, you persuade yourself, that the author was thinking of you."
3124,7517-100437-0020.flac," would probably pretend that he had read it, but he wouldn't deceive me. for one cannot recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering."
3125,7517-100437-0016.flac," the wind and the willows. am i not right again? ah, i was afraid so. the reason why i knew you had not read it is the reason why i call it my book."
3126,7517-100437-0017.flac," for the last 10 or 12 years, i have been recommending it. usually, i speak about it at my first meeting with a stranger. it is my opening remark. just as yours is something futile about the weather."
3127,7517-100437-0023.flac," great admirers of the author and his two earlier famous books, but ignorant thereafter. i had their promise before they left me and waited confidently."
3128,7517-100437-0007.flac, in borrowing the classic upon which you were brought up. this is too much for me. let us say no more about it.
3129,7517-100437-0028.flac," an explanation which suspicious strangers require from me sometimes. i shall not describe the book, for no description would help it. but i shall just say this."
3130,7517-100437-0018.flac," if i don't get it in at the beginning, i squeeze it in at the end. the stranger has got to have it sometime. should i ever find myself in the dock and one never knows?"
3131,7517-100437-0001.flac," i say the second best, so that if you remind me of tom jones or the mayor of casterbridge or any other that you fancy, i can say that, of course, that one is the best."
3132,7517-100437-0030.flac," to every new guest and is regarded as the touchstone of his worth. but it is a book which makes you feel that though everybody in the house loves it, it is only you."
3133,7517-100429-0025.flac," yet if our hostess were to see us marching out within umbrella, how odd she would think us. where are you off to, she would ask, and we could only answer lamely."
3134,7517-100429-0028.flac," what will happen then? aldenham may know, but we his guests do not. some think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and the kitchen garden, but for myself,"
3135,7517-100429-0006.flac," when the pond began to fill. to strangers, this may seem surprising, and it is only fair to tell them the great secret, which is that much of the surrounding land."
3136,7517-100429-0019.flac," and they can be made more readily out of doors. for supposing it is fine, the fresh air calls you to be doing something, and the sight of the newly marked tennis lawn"
3137,7517-100429-0005.flac," thus, the steps helped to make the pond a convenient rain gauge. for obviously, when only three steps are left uncovered, as was the case last monday."
3138,7517-100429-0010.flac," sooth's us, where the record of the ordinary, pedantic rain gauge would leave us infuriated. it speaks much for my friend alden ham's breadth of view that he understood this."
3139,7517-100429-0001.flac," alone or in company, dry-shod to its brink, and estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen in the night. the rye-balled call it the hippopotamus pond, tracing"
3140,7517-100429-0009.flac, has done the damage. the soul yearns for something more startling than that. the record of the pond.
3141,7517-100429-0026.flac," er, i was just going to... er, walk about a bit. but now we tell her brightly. i'm going to see the pond. it must be nearly full. won't you come to? and with any luck, she comes."
3142,7517-100429-0000.flac, the pond. my friend aldenham's pond stands at a convenient distance from the house and is reached by a well-drained gravel path so that in any weather one may walk.
3143,7517-100429-0013.flac," i am one of those who cannot write letters in another man's house, and when my pipe is well-aligned, i say to miss robinson, or whoever it may be. let's go and look at the pond."
3144,7517-100429-0018.flac," must be a record. but anyhow, it is fairly fine now. and what about a little on tennis, or golf, or croquet, or? and so the arrangements for the morning are made."
3145,7517-100429-0022.flac," will be declined. say, come and look at the pond, and the worst sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise. and once he is out, he is out."
3146,7517-100429-0011.flac, and planned the pond accordingly. a most necessary thing in a country house is that there should be a recognized meeting place.
3147,7517-100429-0029.flac, i believe that we are promised something much bigger than that. a man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives.
3148,7517-100429-0030.flac," will help to celebrate it, i have no doubt, with an open air play, tank drama, or whatnot. at any rate, we have every hope that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible."
3149,7517-100429-0003.flac," it is known simply as the pond, a designation which ignores the existence of several neighboring ponds, the gifts of nature, and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man."
3150,7517-100429-0008.flac," for when your whole day's cricket has been spoiled, it is perfectly absurd."
3151,7517-100429-0027.flac, to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond. for there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full.
3152,7517-100429-0031.flac," so that we may watch it fill again. i must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond, but all the same."
3153,7517-100429-0014.flac," rideau, she says, willingly enough, having spent the last quarter of an hour with the times financial supplement. all of the paper that is left to the women in the first rush for the cricket news."
3154,7517-100429-0002.flac," a resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the zoo, beneath the waters of which, if you particularly desire to point the hippopotamus out to somebody, he always lies hidden. to the rest of us"
3155,7517-100429-0007.flac," drained secretly into the pond, too. this seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers."
3156,7517-100429-0023.flac, all this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals. but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents.
3157,7517-100429-0016.flac, we have a little argument about it. ms. robinson being convinced that she stood on the second step after breakfast. and ms. smith repeating that it looks
3158,7517-100429-0020.flac," fills you with thoughts of revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before. but indoors, it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast. and once there with all the papers,"
3159,7517-100429-0024.flac," from morning till night. how tired we get of being indoors on these days, even with the best of books, the pleasantest of companions, the easiest of billiard tables."
3160,7517-100429-0032.flac, have fallen in the last three weeks.
3161,7517-100429-0004.flac, for the pond is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious. there are seven steps to the bottom of the pond and each step
3162,7517-100429-0015.flac," we wandered down to the pond together, and perhaps find brown and mismyth there. a lot of rain in the night says brown. it was only just over the third step after lunch yesterday."
3163,7517-100429-0017.flac," buy and buy, two or three others, stroll up, and we all make measurements together. the general opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night."
3164,7517-100429-0021.flac," to be disinclined, to leave it till lunchtime. a man or woman as lazy as this must not be rushed. say to such a one, come and play, and the invitation."
3165,7517-100429-0012.flac," where the people who have been writing a few letters after breakfast may, when they have finished, meet those who have no intention of writing any, and arrange plans with them for the morning."
3166,2092-145706-0018.flac," there is a lake down there below us, and anyone who bathes in it, though he were at death's door, becomes sound and well on the spot. and those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill,"
3167,2092-145706-0039.flac," no matter how difficult he must succeed in it or die. they did not think long but replied, let him build your majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this, and if he fails in the attempt,"
3168,2092-145706-0060.flac," for in a heap, higher than the king's palace, lay all the grain of the country, and not a single stock of corn had been left behind in any of the fields. and how had all this been done?"
3169,2092-145706-0079.flac," go on, go on, and at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill, howling horribly, and showing their white teeth. the king and his terror called out, stop a moment, i will give you half my kingdom."
3170,2092-145706-0064.flac," the more angry he became, for he could not, in the face of his promise, put the stranger to death. he turned once more to the two brothers and said, his diabolical magic has helped him again."
3171,2092-145706-0028.flac, here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws. for its front paws had both been broken in a trap. farco felt so sorry for the little beast.
3172,2092-145706-0029.flac," that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner, and washed its small paws with the healing water. in a moment the mouse was sound and whole, and after thanking the kind physician, it scampered away over the plowed furrows."
3173,2092-145706-0005.flac," and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread, and then to refuse to give him a bit of hours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs. his eldest brother was delighted with his proposal."
3174,2092-145706-0032.flac," i am most grateful for your kindness, and shall reward you someday. and with these words, she flew away humming gailey. then farco wandered on for many a long day."
3175,2092-145706-0016.flac," and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs. he climbed to the top of a hill and laid down in the grass, and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree."
3176,2092-145706-0044.flac," be of good cheer and lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls. and humming galley, she flew away again. farco went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished."
3177,2092-145706-0021.flac," and so they flew away. their words rejoiced farrakow's heart, and he waited impatiently till evening should come, and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes."
3178,2092-145706-0008.flac, and fasted all that day and the next night. but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread.
3179,2092-145706-0076.flac," increasing in number every moment, till they could be counted by thousands. he drove them all before him onto the hill, where the king and his whole court and farco's two brothers were standing. only the lovely princess was not present."
3180,2092-145706-0068.flac," and sat down on the stump of a tree, wondering what he should do next. suddenly a big wolf ran up to him, and standing still said, i'm very glad to see you again, my kind benefactor."
3181,2092-145706-0017.flac," is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighborhood? i should just think there was, replied the other. many things that don't exist anywhere else in the world."
3182,2092-145706-0001.flac," of her and their father, the three set forth on their travels. the youngest of the three brothers, whose name was ferco, was a beautiful youth with a splendid figure blue eyes, fair hair,"
3183,2092-145706-0080.flac," if you will drive all the wolves away, but farco pretended not to hear and drove some more thousands before him so that everyone quaked with horror and fear. then the king raised his voice again and called out,"
3184,2092-145706-0083.flac," he married her and was crowned king of the country. and the wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes, and farco and his bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together."
3185,2092-145706-0059.flac, and the whole court went out to see the wonder.
3186,2092-145706-0009.flac," and break one of your legs, then we will give you a bit of our bread. at these words, poor farco, wept more bitterly than before, and bore the torment of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens."
3187,2092-145706-0047.flac," this splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen bee, who had summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her. the king's amazement knew no bounds, and the princess's eyes beamed with delight"
3188,2092-145706-0082.flac," till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked brothers and ate them and the whole court up in a moment. then faroko went straight to the palace and set the princess free, and on the same day"
3189,2092-145706-0054.flac," but he could think of no way of escape. the sun sank to rest, and night came on, when a little mouse started out of the grass at fargo's feet, and said to him, i'm delighted to see you"
3190,2092-145706-0007.flac," you ate your loaf in your sleep, you glutton, and you may starve as long as you like, but you won't get a scrap of ours."" ferco was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep, but he said nothing"
3191,2092-145706-0023.flac," till his eyes were damp with dew drops, and in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life before. the moon was shining brightly and lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs."
3192,2092-145706-0062.flac, and he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers who kept on repeating.
3193,2092-145706-0035.flac," for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before. his brothers noticed this, and envy and jealousy were added to their fear, so much so that they determined once more to destroy him."
3194,2092-145706-0050.flac," and turning to the two brothers he said, he has certainly accomplished the first task, with the aid no doubt of his diabolical magic. but what shall we give him to do now?"
3195,2092-145706-0067.flac," and when the king saw this, he ordered her to be shut up in a high tower and carefully guarded till the dangerous magician should either have left the kingdom or been hung on the nearest tree. farco wandered out into the fields again."
3196,2092-145706-0071.flac," if that's all you want done, answered the wolf, you've needing to worry yourself. i'll undertake the task, and you'll hear from me again before sunset tomorrow."
3197,2092-145706-0041.flac," as he was wandering disconsolently about the meadows round the palace, wondering how he could escape being put to death, a little beef flew past, and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear."
3198,2092-145706-0053.flac," the princess grew white with terror when she heard these words, but farco felt much more cheerful than he had done the first time, and wandered out into the meadows again."
3199,2092-145706-0046.flac," with sunflowers for knockers. an all-round, high-asense, and other sweet-smelling flowers bloomed in masses so that the air was perfumed far and near and enchanted all who were present."
3200,2092-145706-0025.flac," he had not gone far before he met a wolf, who was limping disconsolently along on three legs, and who on perceiving farco began to howl dismaly. my good friend said the youth,"
3201,2092-145706-0063.flac," than a wicked magician, only the beautiful princess rejoiced over farco's success, and looked on him with friendly glances which the youth returned. the more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him,"
3202,2092-145706-0081.flac," stop! you shall have my whole kingdom if you will only drive these wolves back to the places they came from. but the wolf kept on encouraging farco and said, go on, go on! so he led the wolves on."
3203,2092-145706-0073.flac, and that he would never see her again if he left the country. he laid down once more on the grass and soon fell fast asleep. all the next day he spent wandering about the fields.
3204,2092-145706-0034.flac," they had managed to obtain places in the king's service, and when they recognized farco with his eyes and legs, sound, and well, they were frightened to death, for they feared he would tell the king of their conduct."
3205,2092-145706-0022.flac," at last it began to grow dusk, and the sun sank behind the mountains. gradually it became cooler on the hill, and the grass grew wet with dew. then farco buried his face in the ground."
3206,2092-145706-0074.flac," then return at once to me and get on my back, and i will help you to drive all the wolves together. then farco went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done."
3207,2092-145706-0011.flac," but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment, and besought them for a second bit. but the more farco wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger,"
3208,2092-145706-0019.flac," become as sharp-sided as the eagle, even if they have been blind from their youth. well, answered the first raven, my eyes are in no want of this healing bath, for heaven be praised."
3209,2092-145706-0070.flac," who's broken leg he had healed, and told him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his life. but how in the world he added, am i to collect all the wolves in the kingdom onto that hill over there?"
3210,2092-145706-0003.flac," for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking. ferco fell fast asleep, but the other two remained awake. and the eldest said to the second brother, what do you say to doing our brother ferco some harm?"
3211,2092-145706-0010.flac," then he could stand no longer, and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out, and his left leg to be broken. and this was done, he stretched out his hand eagerly for the peace of bread."
3212,2092-145706-0040.flac," let him be hung. the king was pleased with this proposal, and commanded fargo to set to work on the following day. the two brothers were delighted, for they thought they had now got rid of fargo forever."
3213,2092-145706-0038.flac," on condition you leave the country. but if you cannot perform what i demand, you shall be hung on the nearest tree."" and turning to the two wicked brothers, he said, suggests something for him to do,"
3214,2092-145706-0048.flac," on the delighted farco. but the two brothers had grown quite green with envy, and only declared the more that farco was nothing but a wicked magician."
3215,2092-145706-0006.flac," and the two we could wretches seized fercos' loaf and ate it all up, while the poor boy was still asleep. when he did awake, he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread, but his brothers cried out."
3216,2092-145706-0077.flac," for she was shut up in her tower, weeping bitterly. the wicked brothers stamped and phoned with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs, but the king was overcome by a sudden terror."
3217,2092-145706-0072.flac," and with these words he trotted quickly away. then the youth rejoiced greatly, for now he felt that his life was safe. but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess."
3218,2092-145706-0066.flac," before tomorrow night. if he does this, he may go free. if not, he shall be hung as you have said."" at these words, the princess burst into tears."
3219,2092-145706-0069.flac," what are you thinking about all alone by yourself? if i can help you in any way, only say the word, for i would like to give you a proof of my gratitude."" farco at once recognized the wolf."
3220,2092-145706-0031.flac," farco was no less willing to help her than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse, so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing. on the spot the queen bee was cured, and turning to farco she said,"
3221,2092-145706-0049.flac," the king, although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his commands had been carried out, was very vexed."
3222,2092-145706-0043.flac," a palace shall be built unlike any that king has dwelt in before. just stay here till i come again and tell you that it is finished."" having said this, she flew merrily away, and fercow"
3223,2092-145706-0012.flac," the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed. so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day, but when night came his endurance gave way, and he let his right eye be put out,"
3224,2092-145706-0024.flac, then farco crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water. no sooner had he done so.
3225,2092-145706-0051.flac," let us make it as difficult as possible, and if he fails, he shall die."" then the eldest brother replied, the corn has all been cut, but it has not yet been put into barns."
3226,2092-145706-0026.flac," be of good cheer for i consume heel your leg. and with these words, he poured some of the precious water over the wolf's paw, and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours."
3227,2092-145706-0055.flac," my kind benefactor? but why are you looking so sad? can i be of any help to you, and thus repay your great kindness to me?"" then farco recognized the mouse whose front paws he had healed and replied,"
3228,2092-145706-0036.flac," they went to the king and told him that farco was a wicked magician who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the princess. then the king had farco brought before him and said,"
3229,2092-145706-0002.flac, and a complexion like milk and roses. his two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be. for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be.
3230,2092-145706-0020.flac, they are as good as ever they were. but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago. so let us fly at once to the lake that i may be restored to health and strength again.
3231,2092-145706-0027.flac, the grateful creature thanked his benefactor warmly and promised farco to do him a good turn if he should ever need it. farco continued his way till he came to a plowed field.
3232,2092-145706-0065.flac," but now what third task shall we set him to do? no matter how impossible it is, he must do it or die."" the eldest answered quickly, let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom onto this hill,"
3233,2092-145706-0061.flac," the little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the land to its help, and together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom. the king could not hide his amazement, but at the same time his wrath increased,"
3234,2092-145706-0014.flac," poor farco ate up the scrap of bread they had left him, and wept bitterly. but no one heard him, or came to his help. night came on, and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close."
3235,2092-145706-0004.flac," he is so beautiful that everyone takes a fancy to him, which is more than they do to us. if we could only get him out of the way, we might succeed better. i quite agree with you answered the second brother."
3236,2092-145706-0057.flac," that needing to stress you much? just trust in me, and before the sun sets again, you shall hear that your task is done. and with these words, the little creature scampered away into the fields."
3237,2092-145706-0000.flac," kletka. there was once upon a time a man and a woman who had three fine-looking sons, but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves, let alone their children."
3238,2092-145706-0042.flac," what is troubling you, my kind benefactor? can i be of any help to you? i am the bee whose wing you healed."
3239,2092-145706-0045.flac," the whole court went out to see the wonder, and their astonishment was great at the sight which met their eyes. a splendid palace reared itself on the hill just outside the walls of the city, made of the most exquisite flowers."
3240,2092-145706-0052.flac," let the nave collect all the grain in the kingdom into one big heap before tomorrow night, and if as much as a stalk of corn is left, let him be put to death."
3241,2092-145706-0078.flac," when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer and calling out to farco, he said, enough, enough, we don't want anymore."" but the wolf on whose back farco sat said to its writer,"
3242,2092-145706-0056.flac," before tomorrow night, all the grain in the kingdom has to be gathered into one big heap, and if as much as a stalk of corn is wanting, i must pay for it with my life. is that all answered the mouse?"
3243,2092-145706-0037.flac," you are accused of being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter, and i condemn you to death. but, if you can fulfill three tasks which i shall set you to do, your life shall be spared."
3244,2092-145706-0075.flac," verko himself returned to the fields, and mounting on the wolves back he rode to the wood close by. quick as lightning the wolf flew round the wood, and in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him."
3245,2092-145706-0030.flac," farco again proceeded on his journey, but he hadn't gone far before a queen bee flew against him, trailing one wing behind her, which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird."
3246,2092-145706-0015.flac," and could only crawl along the ground, not knowing in the least where he was going. but when the sun was once more high in the heavens, federco felt the blazing heat scorch him."
3247,2092-145706-0013.flac," and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread. after his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life, they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him."
3248,2092-145706-0033.flac," and at length reached a strange kingdom. here he thought to himself, he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country, for he had heard that the king's daughter,"
3249,2092-145706-0058.flac," farco, who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word, lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning. the day passed slowly."
3250,2092-145709-0003.flac," the poor beast was all torn and bleeding, and the kind little princess was quite unhappy about it. when the crow saw this, it turned to her and said, i am not really a black crow."
3251,2092-145709-0006.flac," and don't forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night, you must not scream out. for if you give as much as a single cry, my sufferings will be doubled."
3252,2092-145709-0010.flac," when they had done this, they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay, and screaming and yelling all the time, they dragged her towards the cauldron. she nearly died with fright."
3253,2092-145709-0012.flac," it thanked the princess most heartily for her goodness and said that its sufferings had already been greatly lessened. now one of the princess's elder sisters, who was very inquisitive,"
3254,2092-145709-0013.flac," that at last the good-natured little princess consented. but at midnight, when the odd folk appeared, the elders sister screamed with terror, and from this time on, the youngest princess,"
3255,2092-145709-0007.flac, the good-natured princess at once left her home and her family and hurried to the ruined castle and took possession of the room with the golden bed.
3256,2092-145709-0015.flac," the crow came and thanked her for her endurance, and assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been. and so two years passed away, when one day the crow came to the princess and said,"
3257,2092-145709-0002.flac," and in this garden, the youngest princess used often to walk. one day when she was pacing to and fro under the limed trees, a black crow hopped out of a rose bush in front of her."
3258,2092-145709-0017.flac," and take possession of the belongings of my forefathers, you must go out into the world and take service as a maid servant. the young princess consented at once and for a whole year,"
3259,2092-145709-0018.flac," and had worked her little white hands weary, she heard a rustling beside her, and a cry of joy. then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her, who knelt down at her feet,"
3260,2092-145709-0019.flac," and kissed the little weary white hands. ""'i am the prince,' he said, ""'who you in your goodness when i was wandering about in the shape of a black crow, freed from the most awful torments."
3261,2092-145709-0009.flac, her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room. they at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace. then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it.
3262,2092-145709-0001.flac," about half a mile from the palace in which they lived, their stutter castle, which was uninhabited and almost a ruin. but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers."
3263,2092-145709-0011.flac, but she never uttered a sound. then of a sudden the cock grew and all the evil spirits vanished. at the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all around the room with joy.
3264,2092-145709-0004.flac," but an enchanted prince who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery. if you only liked princess, you could save me. but you would have to say goodbye to all your own people,"
3265,2092-145709-0014.flac," insisted always on keeping watch alone. so she lived in solitude all the daytime, and at night she would have been frightened, had she not been so brave. but every day,"
3266,2092-145709-0016.flac," in another year, i shall be freed from the spell i am under at present, because then the seven years will be over. but before i can resume my natural form, i will be free to go to the next level."
3267,2092-145709-0008.flac," when night approached, she lay down, but though she shut her eyes tight, sleep would not come. at midnight she heard to her great horror someone coming along the passage, and in a minute"
3268,2092-145709-0000.flac," kletke. once upon a time there were three princesses who were all three young and beautiful, but the youngest, although she was not fairer than the other two, was the most lovable of them all."
3269,2092-145709-0005.flac," and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle. there is one habitable room in it, in which there is a golden bed. there you will have to live all by yourself,"
3270,2092-145709-0021.flac," it was difficult to believe that it was the same, for it had all been rebuilt and done up again."
3271,2092-145709-0020.flac," come now to my castle with me, and let us live their happily together. so they went to the castle, where they had both endured so much."
3272,6437-66173-0007.flac," but on seeing me sweep across the yard, whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling, he called out lustily. lay low, conway, here's young bailey!"" conway turned, just in time, to catch on his shoulder the blow intended for his head."
3273,6437-66173-0008.flac," he reached forward one of his long arms. he had arms like a windmill, that boy, and grasping me by the hair tore out quite a respectable handful. the tears flew to my eyes."
3274,6437-66173-0017.flac," but i was going to, because he knows who put meek's mortar over our door, and i know well enough who did it. it was that sneaking little malatter, pointing at me. oh, by george, i cried, reddening at the insult."
3275,6437-66173-0026.flac, the personal inconvenience i suffered from my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted on me indirectly by his persistent cruelty to little biny wallace. i should have lacked the spirit of a hen if i had not resented it finally.
3276,6437-66173-0049.flac," he had, as we suspected, witnessed the closing scene of the fight from the schoolroom window. and the next morning, after prayers, i was not wholly unprepared when master conway and myself were called up to the desk for examination."
3277,6437-66173-0055.flac," every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to fight. if one boy maltreats another within school bounds or within school hours, that is a matter for me to settle. the case should be laid before me."
3278,6437-66173-0042.flac," miss abigail, opening the front door, started back at my hilarious appearance. i tried to smile upon her sweetly, but the smile, rippling over my swollen cheek and dying away like a spent wave on my nose,"
3279,6437-66173-0038.flac," i couldn't help saying to myself, if this is victory, how about that other fellow?"" tom said harry blake hesitating. well?"
3280,6437-66173-0057.flac," if there's any fighting to be done, i am the person to be consulted. i disapprove of boys fighting. it is unnecessary and un-christian. in the present instance, i consider every large boy in this school at fault."
3281,6437-66173-0059.flac," i now request bailey and conway to shake hands in the presence of the school and acknowledge their regret at what has occurred. conway and i approached each other slowly and cautiously, as if we were bent upon another hostile collision."
3282,6437-66173-0032.flac," fight it out, and don't give in while you can stand and see. and don't give in when you can't see, for i could stand very little and see not at all, having pummeled the school pump for the last twenty seconds."
3283,6437-66173-0061.flac," ""'you can go to your seats,' said mr. grimshaw, turning his face aside to hide a smile. i am sure my apology was a very good one.' i never had any more trouble with conway.'"
3284,6437-66173-0027.flac," i'm glad that i faced conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever. i'm glad that phil adams taught me to box, and i say to all youngsters, learn to box, to ride, to pull in or, and to swim."
3285,6437-66173-0003.flac," he performed the feet unconsciously. throughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a chronic state of dislocation, indicating great mental agitation on the part of the owner. we fully expected an outbreak from him at recess."
3286,6437-66173-0022.flac," and you'll have the sun in his eyes. behold us once more face to face, like david and the philistine. look at us as long as you may, for this is all you shall see of the combat."
3287,6437-66173-0004.flac," but the intermission passed off tranquilly, somewhat to our disappointment. at the close of the afternoon session, it happened that benny wallace and myself, having got swamped in our latin exercise,"
3288,6437-66173-0024.flac," you'll get no description of it from me simply because i think it would prove very poor reading, and not because i consider my revolt against conway's tyranny unjustifiable. i had borne conway's persecutions for many months with lamb-like patience."
3289,6437-66173-0037.flac," i felt that i was not only following my nose, but following it so closely that i was in some danger of treading on it. i seemed to have nose enough for the whole party. my left cheek also was puffed out like a dumpling."
3290,6437-66173-0018.flac," cool is the word,"" said adams, as he bound a handkerchief round my head, and carefully tucked away the long-stragling locks that offered attempting advantage to the enemy. whoever heard of a fellow with such a head of hair going into action."
3291,6437-66173-0001.flac," his red hair seemed to change to a livelier red, and his salo cheeks to a deeper salo, as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our slates the next day in school. he knew we were watching him, and made sundry mouths,"
3292,6437-66173-0031.flac," it's quite right and justifiable if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger. but don't say no because you fear a licking and say or think it's because you fear god, for that's neither christian nor honest. and if you do fight!"
3293,6437-66173-0015.flac," and put back my hair. this last condition was rather a stagurer. ""'i shan't do nothing of the sort,' said conway, sulquely. ""'then the thing must go on,' said adams with dignity."
3294,6437-66173-0035.flac," the gentle soul had stood throughout the contest with his face turned to the fence, suffering untold agony."
3295,6437-66173-0023.flac," according to my thinking, the hospital teaches a better lesson than the battlefield. i will tell you about my black eye and my swollen lip, if you will, but not a word of the fight."
3296,6437-66173-0044.flac," captain nutter, as the recognized professional warrior of our family, could not consistently take me to task for fighting conway, nor was he disposed to do so."
3297,6437-66173-0058.flac," but as the offense is one of omission rather than comission, my punishment must rest only on the two boys convicted of misdemeanor. conway loses his recess for a month, and bailey has a page added to his latin lessons for the next four recitations."
3298,6437-66173-0021.flac," is your man ready? asked phil adams, addressing rogers. ready. keep your back to the gate, tom."
3299,6437-66173-0013.flac," the boys fell back perforce on the schoolyard. just at this crisis a dozen or so of the templars entered the gate, and seeing at a glance the belligerent status of conway and myself dropped bat and ball and rushed to the spot where we stood."
3300,6437-66173-0062.flac," he and his shadow, seth rogers, gave me a wide berth for many months. nor was benny wallace subjected to further molestation. miss abigail's sanitary stores, including a bottle of opa del doc, were never called into requisition."
3301,6437-66173-0005.flac," were detained in school for the purpose of refreshing our memories, with a page of mr. andrews perplexing irregular verbs. benny wallace finishing his task first was dismissed. i followed shortly after."
3302,6437-66173-0030.flac," that you have to say yes or no to a challenge to fight, say no if you can, only take care you make it plain to yourself why you say no. it's a proof of the highest courage if done from true christian motives."
3303,6437-66173-0053.flac," i am the boy to be blamed for i was the cause of the trouble."" this drew out the story of conway's harsh treatment of the smaller boys. as benny related the wrongs of his playfellows, saying very little of his own grievances,"
3304,6437-66173-0002.flac," and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums. conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his own, that of throwing his thumbs out of joint at will. times while absorbed in study, or on becoming nervous at recitation."
3305,6437-66173-0012.flac," it was accustomed with the larger pupils to return to the playground after school and play baseball until sundown. the town authorities had prohibited ball playing on the square, and there being no other available place."
3306,6437-66173-0048.flac," ""'they'll be handy to have in the house,' says miss abigail, grimly. ""'of course, so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by mr. grimshaw.'"
3307,6437-66173-0010.flac," and keeping my eye fixed steadily on conway's, in all of which i was faithfully following the instructions of phil adams, whose father subscribed to a sporting journal. conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude,"
3308,6437-66173-0040.flac," shouldn't wonder. no, he didn't, broken adams, or he would have stopped at short meter."
3309,6437-66173-0060.flac," we clasped hands in the tamest manner imaginable and conway mumbled. i'm sorry i fought with you. i think you are, i replied, dryly. and i'm sorry i had to thrash you."
3310,6437-66173-0050.flac," as the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of bailey vs. conway, i shall not report the trial further than to say that adams, martin, and several other pupils testified to the fact"
3311,6437-66173-0006.flac," and, unstepping into the playground, saw my little friend plastered as it were, up against the fence. and conway, standing in front of him, ready to deliver a blow on the upturned, unprotected face, whose gentleness would have stayed any arm but a cowards."
3312,6437-66173-0039.flac," did you see mr. grimshaw looking out of the recitation room window just as we left the yard? no, was he though? i'm sure of it."
3313,6437-66173-0051.flac," that conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the temple school. their evidence also went to show that conway was a quarrelsome character generally, bad for conway. seth rogers, on the part of his friend,"
3314,6437-66173-0000.flac," chapter 10 i fight conway there was one person, however, who cherished a strong suspicion that the centipedes had had a hand in the business, and that person was conway."
3315,6437-66173-0054.flac," i noticed that mr. grimshaw's hand, unknown to himself perhaps, rested lightly from time to time on wallace's sunny hair. the examination finished, mr. grimshaw leaned on the desk thoughtfully for a moment, and then said,"
3316,6437-66173-0016.flac," rogers, as i understand it, is your second conway? bailey camir. what's the rower about? he was thrashing benny wallace. no i wasn't interrupted conway."
3317,6437-66173-0029.flac," ever written for boys are these words. learn to box then, as you learn to play cricket and football. not one of you will be the worst, but very much the better for learning to box well."
3318,6437-66173-0034.flac," convinced of my error, i accepted his congratulations, with those of the other boys, blandly and blindly. i remember that benny wallace wanted to give me his silver pencil case."
3319,6437-66173-0046.flac," i believe it runs in the family."" i think,"" said miss abigail, without the faintest expression on her countenance, that a tablespoon full of hot drop, the captain interrupted miss abigail, preemptively."
3320,6437-66173-0019.flac," muttered phil, twitching the handkerchief to ascertain if it were securely tied. he then loosened my gallowses, braces, and buckled them tightly above my hips. now then, pantom, never say die."
3321,6437-66173-0036.flac," as scorted by two or three of the schoolfellows, i walked home through the pleasant autumn twilight, battered but triumphant. as i went along, my cap cocked on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye."
3322,6437-66173-0014.flac," is it a fight?"" asked phil adams, who saw by our freshness that we had not yet got to work. ""'yes, it's a fight,' i answered. unless conway will ask wallace's pardon, promise never to hector me in future,"
3323,6437-66173-0041.flac," well, it can't be helped now, i reflected. as the monkey said when he fell out of the coconut tree, added charlie marden, trying to make me laugh. it was early candlelight when we reached the house."
3324,6437-66173-0009.flac, but they were not the tears of defeat. they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature paid to the departed trecess. in a second my little jacket lay on the ground and i stood on guard resting lightly on my right leg
3325,6437-66173-0011.flac," and there we were, glaring at each other motionless, neither of us disposed to risk an attack, but both on the alert to resist one. there's no telling how long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been interrupted."
3326,6437-66173-0025.flac," i might have shielded myself by appealing to mr. grimshaw, but no boy in the temple grammar school could do that without losing cast. whether this was just or not doesn't matter a pin since it was so, a traditionary law of the place."
3327,6437-66173-0052.flac," proved that i had struck the first blow. that was bad for me."" ""'if you please, sir,' said benny wallace, holding up his hand for permission to speak. bailey didn't find on his own account. he fought on my account. and if you please, sir,'"
3328,6437-66173-0047.flac, directing her to make a shade out of cardboard and black silk to tie over my eye. miss abigail must have been possessed with the idea that i had taken up pugilism as a profession for she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders.
3329,6437-66173-0033.flac," when conway retired from the field. as phil adam stepped up to shake hands with me, he received a telling blow in the stomach, for all the fight was not out of me yet, and i bestook him for a new adversary."
3330,6437-66173-0020.flac," conway regarded these business-like preparations with evident misgiving, for he called rogers to his side and had himself arrayed in a similar manner, though his hair was cropped so close that you couldn't have taken hold of it with a pair of tweezers."
3331,6437-66173-0028.flac," the occasion may come round when a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments will be of service to you. in one of the best books,"
3332,6437-66173-0043.flac," produced an expression of which miss abigail declared she had never seen the like, accepting on the face of a chinese idol. she hustled me, unceremoniously, into the presence of my grandfather in the sitting room."
3333,6437-66173-0045.flac," for the captain was well aware of the long continued provocation i had endured. ah, you rascal! grat the old gentleman after hearing my story. just like me when i was young, always in one kind of trouble or another."
3334,6437-66173-0056.flac," i disapprove of tailbearing. i never encourage it in the slightest degree. but when one pupil systematically persecutes a schoolmate, it is the duty of some headboy to inform me. no pupil has a right to take the law into his own hands."
3335,6437-66172-0041.flac," to kill less than three birds with one stone did not suit our sanguineary purpose. we disliked the widow not so much for her sentimentality, as for being the mother of bill conway. we disliked mr. meeks not because he was incipid."
3336,6437-66172-0005.flac," some occult association being established between a scent a piece and a scent a piece, suspended by a string round his neck. the medals were worn next to the skin, and it was while bathing one day at grave point, with jack harris and fred langdon."
3337,6437-66172-0012.flac," if you would advance to another inch, you would have disappeared down in a bis three thousand feet deep. i naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information. a prick from some two-pronged instrument, evidently a pitchfork."
3338,6437-66172-0015.flac," a second pistol shot was heard. the something i stood on sunk with a crash beneath my feet, and i fell two miles as nearly as i could compute it. at the same instant, the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes, and i found myself standing in an empty hog's head."
3339,6437-66172-0004.flac," though i was an active member of the body during the remainder of my residence at rivermouth, and at one time held the onerous position of fc, first centipede. each of the elect wore a copper scent."
3340,6437-66172-0026.flac, to mystify the state and slow-going river mouthians was our frequent pleasure. several of our pranks won us such a reputation among the townsfolk that we were credited with having a large finger in whatever went to miss in the place. one morning
3341,6437-66172-0001.flac," the distraction which prevailed in the classes the week preceding the fourth had subsided, and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities, accepting a noticeable wand of eyebrows on the part of pepper whitcom and myself."
3342,6437-66172-0019.flac," i afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club, for these initiations, as you may imagine, were sometimes very comical spectacles, especially when the aspirant for centipedal honors happened to be of a timid disposition."
3343,6437-66172-0008.flac," such was the modest title given to the loft over my friend's woodhouse. my hands were securely pinioned, and my eyes covered with a thick silk hankerchief. at the head of the stairs i was told in an unrecognizable husky voice."
3344,6437-66172-0024.flac," by these simple and ingenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition, sometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter. i have said that the society had no special object. it is true there was a tacit understanding among us,"
3345,6437-66172-0009.flac," if i felt myself physically, too weak to undergo the necessary tortures. i replied that i was not too weak, and atoned which i intended to be resolute, but which, in spite of me, seemed to come from the pit of my stomach. it is well."
3346,6437-66172-0010.flac," a prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination, and i was wondering what would come next."
3347,6437-66172-0006.flac," that i had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch by a sight of these singular emblems. as soon as i ascertained the existence of a boys' club, of course i was ready to die to join it, and eventually i was allowed to join."
3348,6437-66172-0035.flac," and now he had caused us to be arraigned before justice clapped him on a charge equally groundless and painful. after much noisy discussion, a plan of retaliation was agreed upon."
3349,6437-66172-0032.flac," the trick, as was afterwards proved, had been played by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor. we were indebted for our arrest to master conway, who had slightly dropped a hint within the hearing of selechtman mudge to the effect that"
3350,6437-66172-0030.flac," when the captain dragged me ignominously from the hay-mow, and conducted me more dead than alive to the office of justice clapham. here i encountered five other pallid culprits, who had been fished out of divers, coal-bens, carrots, and chicken-coops."
3351,6437-66172-0018.flac," the mystic twelve revolved about me. this concluded the ceremony. with a merry shout, the boys threw off their masks, and i was declared a regularly installed member of the rmc."
3352,6437-66172-0040.flac, the ladies fondness and the gentleman's blindness were topics ably handled at every sewing circle in the town. it was through these two luckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common enemy.
3353,6437-66172-0039.flac, casting destructive glances across the street. the artificial roses in her cap and her whole languishing manner saying as plainly as a label on the prescription to be taken immediately. but mr. meeks didn't take.
3354,6437-66172-0002.flac," in august we had two weeks vacation. it was about this time that i became a member of the rivermouth centipedes, a secret society composed of twelve of the temple grammar school boys."
3355,6437-66172-0027.flac," about a week after my admission into the secret order, the quiet citizens awoke to find that the signboards of all the principal streets had changed places during the night. people who went trustfully to sleep in current square opened their eyes in honeysuckle terrace."
3356,6437-66172-0016.flac," surrounded by twelve masked figures fantastically dressed. one of the conspirators was really appalling, with a tin saucepan on his head, and a tiger skin sleigh robe thrown over his shoulders. i scarcely need say..."
3357,6437-66172-0021.flac," in a low tone, as if not intended for the ear of the victim. deobulous! fetch me the red hot iron. the expedition with which that tongue would disappear was simply ridiculous."
3358,6437-66172-0022.flac," our meetings were held in various barns at no stated periods, but as circumstances suggested. any member had a right to call a meeting. each boy who failed to report himself was fined one cent."
3359,6437-66172-0007.flac," the initiation ceremony took place in fred langdon's barn, where i was submitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a timorous boy. before being led to the grotto of enchantment."
3360,6437-66172-0023.flac," whenever a member had reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend, he called a meeting. for instance, immediately on learning the death of harry blake's great-grandfather, i issue to call."
3361,6437-66172-0031.flac," to answer the demands of the outraged laws. charlie marden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his father's house, and looked like a recently exhumed mummy. there was not the least evidence against us, and indeed we were wholly innocent of the offense."
3362,6437-66172-0025.flac," that the centipedes were to stand by one another on all occasions, though i don't remember that they did. but further than this, we had no purpose, unless it was to accomplish as a body the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as individuals."
3363,6437-66172-0020.flac," if he showed the slightest terror he was certain to be tricked unmercifully. one of our subsequent devices, a humble invention of my own, was to request the blindfolded candidate to put out his tongue, whereupon the first centipede would say,"
3364,6437-66172-0038.flac," were of a nature not to be misunderstood, and were not misunderstood by anyone, but mr. meeks himself. the widow carried on address-making establishment at her residence on the corner opposite meeks's drugstore."
3365,6437-66172-0029.flac," and six of the temple grammar school boys were summoned to appear before justice clapham. having tearfully disclaimed my grandfather all knowledge of the transaction, i disappeared from the family circle and was not apprehended until late in the afternoon."
3366,6437-66172-0036.flac," there was a certain slim, mild apothecary in the town by the name of meeks. it was generally given out that mr. meeks had a vague desire to get married, but being a shy and timorous youth lacked the moral courage to do so."
3367,6437-66172-0003.flac," this was an honor to which i had long aspired, but being a new boy i was not admitted to the fraternity until my character had fully developed itself. it was a very select society, the object of which i never fathomed."
3368,6437-66172-0043.flac," on the following morning, as the orderly citizens wendered their way to church, passed the widows a boat, their sober faces relaxed at beholding over her front door, the well-known guilt, mortar and pestle which usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner."
3369,6437-66172-0034.flac, it was unanimously resolved that conway's animosity should not be quietly submitted to. he had sought to inform against us in the stage-coach business. he had volunteered to carry petongil's little bill for 24 ice creams to charlie mardin's father.
3370,6437-66172-0028.flac," jones' avenue at the north end had suddenly become walnut street, and penut street was nowhere to be found. confusion reigned. the town authorities took the matter in hand without delay."
3371,6437-66172-0037.flac," it was also well known that the widow conway had not buried her heart with the late lamented. as to her shyness that was not so clear. indeed her attentions to mr. meeks, whose mother she might have been,"
3372,6437-66172-0017.flac," that there were no vestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which i had passed so cautiously. my ascent had been to the top of the hog's head, and my decent to the bottom thereof. holding one another by the hand, and chanting a low dirge,"
3373,6437-66172-0044.flac," was recognized at once. it spread like wildfire over the town, and, though the mortar and the placard were speedily removed, our triumph was complete. the whole community was on the broad grin and our participation in the affair seemingly unsuspected."
3374,6437-66172-0014.flac," i have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by dismal groans from different parts of the grotto. finally, i was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an incalculable height."
3375,6437-66172-0013.flac," gently checked my retreat. i was then conducted to the brink of several other precipices, and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms, where the result would have been instant death if i had committed the least mistake."
3376,6437-66172-0011.flac," the unknown voice then directed me to take ten steps forward and stop at the word halt. i took ten steps and halted. stric and mortal set a second husky voice, more husky if possible than the first."
3377,6437-66172-0033.flac," young bailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs. when he was called upon to make good his assertion, he was considerably more terrified than the centipedes, though they were ready to sink into their shoes. at our next meeting,"
3378,6437-66172-0000.flac," in the course of ten days i recovered sufficiently from my injuries to attend school, where for a little while i was looked upon as a hero on account of having been blown up. what don't we make a hero of?"
3379,6437-66172-0042.flac," like his own syrups, but because the widow loved him. bill conway, we hated for himself. late one dark saturday night in september, we carried our plan into effect."
3380,7190-90543-0035.flac," they are significant wing, but i cannot see yet in which direction they lead us. we must wait, for the moment there's nothing to be done. i had become so accustomed that quarrel is jumping to some sudden conclusion that i was disappointed."
3381,7190-90543-0038.flac," he had several cabinets in his room containing specimens, and everything had been turned onto the floor and damaged more or less. in fact, although nothing had been taken, the damage was considerable. on the night of the burglary, dr. wood was away from home."
3382,7190-90543-0032.flac," it was so now. you did not seem interested in the broken box of counters?"" she said, turning toward her grandfather. i wonder, wrigan, is that the clue? quarrel said quickly. it creeps into my brain. the counters were in a heap, i said."
3383,7190-90543-0000.flac," however obscure a mystery may be, there is always some pointer circumstance, which have rightly interpreted, will lead to its solution. even in those crimes, which have never been elucidated, this point exists, only it has never been duly appreciated."
3384,7190-90543-0005.flac," there were several silver articles on the sideboard, but these had not been touched. the burglars appeared to have given all their attention to sir joseph's room, which was in a state of confusion. two covers and every drawer had been turned out, and the contents thrown about in all directions."
3385,7190-90543-0022.flac," the cigarette ends, the dirty glasses and the biscuit crumbs seem to me rather gratuitous deceptions. and, wait, said quarrels, you assume a little too much? they would have deceived nine men out of ten. you happen to be the tenth man."
3386,7190-90543-0026.flac," i think that would entirely depend on the man's temperament, professor."
3387,7190-90543-0024.flac, why should you think so? his manner was curious. then there is only his own statement that nothing has been taken. was opposing he wished to get rid of papers or...
3388,7190-90543-0041.flac," he unexpected as happened, i said. no, no, they expected."
3389,7190-90543-0020.flac," he said, i think there was only one burglar, but for some reason he thought it important that it should be believed there were more. a very important point, and a reasonable conclusion, i fancy, said quarrels. if you are right, and narrows the sphere of inquiry,"
3390,7190-90543-0034.flac, did that strike you as significant as the quarrels? i cannot say it did.
3391,7190-90543-0010.flac," was inclined to laugh at my question, and proceeded to inform me that he had no family skeleton."
3392,7190-90543-0009.flac," this was the obvious explanation, but it did not satisfy me. i questioned sir joseph about his papers. had he any document which, for private or public reasons, someone might be anxious to obtain? he said he had not."
3393,7190-90543-0025.flac," would he not have robbed himself of something to make the affair more plausible?"" said quarles. the amateur constantly overlooks the obvious, i answered. the professor shook his head."
3394,7190-90543-0036.flac," naturally, i was not idle during the next few days, but at the end of them i had learned nothing. then the unexpected happened. on consecutive nights two doctors' houses were burgoled. the first was in kensington."
3395,7190-90543-0016.flac," had not been taken from sir joseph's box, which contained only turkish ones, and although they had apparently been thrown down carelessly, there was no ash upon the carpet nor anywhere else."
3396,7190-90543-0037.flac," rather than intended robbery. nothing had been stolen, but everything in his room was in disorder, and a small and unique inlady cabinet with a secret spring lock had been smashed to pieces. several cigarette ends were on the floor."
3397,7190-90543-0012.flac, but there were certain points against this idea. no one had moved about the house during the night.
3398,7190-90543-0011.flac, had never been in touch with any mysterious society.
3399,7190-90543-0021.flac," nero's it very much. taken with the other facts of the case? exactly, i answered. there's a suggestion to my mind of amateur-ness in the affair. i grant the safe was not a difficult one to break open, but it had not been done in a very expert manner."
3400,7190-90543-0027.flac," sir joseph's standing is very high. sutton temptation or necessity may subvert the highest character, i answered."
3401,7190-90543-0045.flac," much dependent upon the answer, if we had?"
3402,7190-90543-0040.flac," for a revolver, loaded in every chamber, was found on one of the cabinets, apparently having put it ready for use, he had forgotten to take it away. the doctor was furious at the wanted destruction of his specimens."
3403,7190-90543-0018.flac," and probably a little of the liquid had been emptied out of this, into the other two. on inquiry, one of the servants told me that only a very little of the spirit had been taken. she also said there was only one biscuit left in the box last night, and it was there now."
3404,7190-90543-0031.flac," when a mystery was cleared up, it was easy to say that zena had put him on the right road, and i considered it a whim of his more than anything else."
3405,7190-90543-0001.flac," for which their detective first looks, and since few crimes of any are committed without some definite reason, it is most frequently found in the mode of. his almost superhuman power of recognizing this key clue was the foundation of christopher quiles' success."
3406,7190-90543-0029.flac," not an answer to any direct question of mine, showing that the ideas were in his mind. why? the explanation would be simple if he were the burglar of his own papers."
3407,7190-90543-0017.flac," if my idea were correct, it would mean that they had been put there in purpose to mislead. i examined the three glasses on a denueling table. there was the stain of lips at the rim of one, but not of the other two. only one had been drunk out of."
3408,7190-90543-0023.flac," amateur or not, we have to do with a very smart man, so don't underestimate the enemy wigan. assuming this to be the work of an amateur or to what definite point does it lead you? do this question, i replied. did sir joseph maynard burgle his own house?"
3409,7190-90543-0039.flac," only servants being in the house. the cook, suffering from faceache, having restless all night, but had heard nothing."
3410,7190-90543-0008.flac," it looked as if the box had been knocked down and trotted around by mistake, but the counters were in a little heap close to the broken fragments. it appeared that the burglars must have been disturbed and had made off without securing their booty."
3411,7190-90543-0004.flac," not a very difficult matter, and had evidently gone to the dining-room and helped themselves to spirits from a tantalist which was on the side-board. three glasses, with a little of the liquor left in them, were on the table, and near them were some pisky crumbs."
3412,7190-90543-0006.flac," but of an old-fashioned type, presenting little difficulty to experts. in it, besides papers and about 70 pounds in gold, and it came as bag,"
3413,7190-90543-0030.flac," i admit the argument is sound, wiggin, but it does not creep into my brain with any compelling influence. there was only missing in the chains somewhere, and he looked at zina. his often repeated statement that she helped him by her questions had never impressed me very greatly."
3414,7190-90543-0028.flac," when i questioned sir joseph about his papers, his manner seemed curious. as i have said, he had once declared that he had no part in any government's secret, or a mysterious society. grit to it disinformation you understand."
3415,7190-90543-0013.flac, the silver on the floor was scattered.
3416,7190-90543-0042.flac," i've read every report, but tell me yourself every detail. i did so. the same brand of cigarettes, he asked. no, but i'll cheap american ones."
3417,7190-90543-0003.flac," and soon after midnight the household had retired. neither sir joseph nor lady maynard nor any of the servants were disturbed during the night, but next morning it was found that burglars had entered. they had got in by a passage window at the back."
3418,7190-90543-0007.flac," presentations which had been made to him, and some unique specimens of the queen and period. all this silver was upon the floor, also the bag of money intact."
3419,7190-90543-0046.flac," if the thief had not found what he wanted, he would continue his search, i argued. for some reason, he connected sir joseph maynard with the object of a search."
3420,7190-90543-0033.flac," as quarrels? no, that would have scattered them more. they were round, and might have fallen over after having been put one upon another, as one gathers coppers together when counting a number of them. sir joseph picked them up."
3421,7190-90543-0014.flac," and it looked as if it had been thrown aside carelessly, as though it were not what the thieves were in search of. and surely, had they left in a hurry, the bag of money would have been taken."
3422,7190-90543-0019.flac," by doing so, i certainly saved one valuable life, possibly more than one. that he was interested was shown by our german to the empty room."
3423,7190-90543-0002.flac," and his solution of the mysterious burglaries, which caused that speculation for a time, was not the least of his achievements. sir joseph maynard, the imminent position of harley street, had given a small dinner party one evening. the guests left early."
3424,7190-90543-0043.flac, you still think that? nothing has happened?
3425,7190-90543-0044.flac," no, i hold to the one man theory. and you are right. he snapped. i admit, i might not have gone upon the right track, had you not made that discovery. it was clever, wigan. it did not seem to help you to a theory, i answered. drew?"
3426,7190-90543-0015.flac," moreover, the cigarette ends and the dirty glasses suggested a certain legially method of going to work, and men of this kind were not easily frightened. the cigarette ends puzzled me. they were of a cheap american brand."
3427,7190-90542-0081.flac," was among those hanging over the fire, sir henry was for many years in borneo, wiggin. before a large part of their time was up country, helping to put down the head hunting which still existed there and still does exist according to all accounts when the natives think they can escape detection."
3428,7190-90542-0082.flac," the horrible custom proved too much for his disease brain and fascinated him. you see how my theory grew, and i looked for the actual proof, which we found last night."
3429,7190-90542-0070.flac, what year wiggins he said when i last he kind of sent it to talk it was zina who first set me on the right road when she remarked that a man who had walked in a ditch carrying a bag would arrest attention. two points were suggested first.
3430,7190-90542-0079.flac," and the insane desire proved irresistible. he was cunning too. he must know everybody in the neighborhood, yet the man he killed was unknown. we shall find, presently, i have no doubt that the victim was some wanderer returning unexpectedly to friends and with him."
3431,7190-90542-0069.flac," in the darkness before the dawn, the man moved about the shed again, and presently i heard him go. visions? his perquels as i started up to go after him. he will not run away."
3432,7190-90542-0072.flac, why should a head be required? what kind of man would be likely to want a head?
3433,7190-90542-0077.flac," he was saying enough to be somewhere where he was not known when this time of the year came around. at the full moon he was always queer, witness last night, but he's only dangerous in january, dangerous i mean without provocation."
3434,7190-90542-0073.flac," i saw for some peculiarity in his manner and found none. yet his history coincided with my theory. he knew nothing about him, i suppose? nothing. rather, an interesting career, but with a hereditary taint in it, wows went on."
3435,7190-90542-0083.flac," the arrest of sir henry buckingham caused an enormous sensation. he was subsequently put into a lunatic asylum, where he died not many months afterward. fortunately, he had no children to run to risk of madness in their turn."
3436,7190-90542-0080.flac," sir henry, waiting in the wood, perhaps for hours, may have allowed others to pass before this man came. he realized that he was a stranger and attacked him. but the head."
3437,7190-90542-0071.flac," that the man might not have far to go to reach a place of safety. secondly, that he had come prepared to take a head away with him. in your speculation, you may say."
3438,7190-90542-0075.flac," how have you learned all this? he is important enough to have some of his doings chronicled and he wrote some interesting articles for a country gentleman's newspaper about his number and a tour of nature studies in such like. another point, both these murders happened at the time of the full moon."
3439,7190-90542-0074.flac," his mother was a centric. her husband was rich enough to have her looked after at home. had she been a poor person, she would have died in a madhouse. religious mania, her swas and her son had inherited it in a curious fashion."
3440,7190-90542-0076.flac," i am not absolutely sure, but i think you will find that for the last half-dozen years sir henry has not been in england in january. you think? i think there would have been other heads missing if he had been. guarral's answer."
3441,7190-90542-0078.flac," to preserve his secret, i have little doubt he would go to any length. that is why i warned you to be ready to shoot when we went upon our journey of discovery. now this year he was in england. illness had kept him to his house yonder."
3442,7190-90542-0068.flac," and i waited expecting some further revelation, listening for other footsteps. none came. the fire flickered lower and went out, the moon had set, and the cold of the early morning got into my bones."
3443,7190-90542-0005.flac," he was often as a stonest at my acumen and following a clue, as i was at his marvelous theories."
3444,7190-90542-0016.flac," on this occasion i went to quarrels with the object of interesting him in the withen case, and he forced all of me by beginning to talk about it the moment i entered the room. here i may mention a fact which i had not discovered at first."
3445,7190-90542-0061.flac," he was short, thick set, and quick in his movements."
3446,7190-90542-0002.flac," but such was my case, and, since zena's manner did not suggest that she was particularly interested in me, my love affair seemed to rather hopeless one. my association with christopher crow's has, however,"
3447,7190-90542-0050.flac," the back part being closed in. the roof was statched with bark and dried bracken, and against one end of the veranda was a notch tree trunk, serving as a ladder. as i expected, said quarrels with some excitement. we must get on to the veranda for a moment."
3448,7190-90542-0018.flac," the foreign cut of the clothes may be of importance, he said. i'm not sure. is this wood you mentioned of any great extent? no, it runs beside the row for two or three hundred yards. toward with him? no, it was near the with and end of it that the dead man was found."
3449,7190-90542-0036.flac, quarrel scramble through a hedge into a wood by the roadside.
3450,7190-90542-0027.flac," and, mad doctor, ben on brain experiments, is that your theory? we can..."
3451,7190-90542-0063.flac," only the smoke-girls about it. then the man moved the wooden block to the side of the fire and sat down facing us, the flickering flames throwing a red glow over him. wiggin, do you see? whispered quals. not clearly. we'll go nearer carefully."
3452,7190-90542-0008.flac," it was not until some days later that the case came into my hands, and in the interval the local authorities had not been idle. it was noted that the man was poorly dressed, that his hands proved he was used to a manual labor, but there was no mark either on his body or on his clothing."
3453,7190-90542-0051.flac," i think we are alone here, but keep your ears open. the shed was evidently used sometimes. there was a stone slab which had served as a fireplace, and from a beam above hung a short chain, a watch a pot could easily be fixed. we'll get away quickly, said quarrels."
3454,7190-90542-0033.flac," the next afternoon he arranged a drive. i thought we were going to with him, but we turned away from the village and presently quarrel stopped the carriage."
3455,7190-90542-0000.flac, the identity of the final victim.
3456,7190-90542-0058.flac," during the cave part of the pit, it did greater shadow than ever. i could not attempt to say how long we had waited in utter silence when quarrels touched my arm. someone was coming, and with no particular stealth."
3457,7190-90542-0042.flac," to this, where else pointed. ""'that is our way,' he said, ""'we'll use what cover we can.' we plunged into the wood again, and we're soon in the wilderness, forcing our way, sometimes with considerable difficulty, through the undergrowth."
3458,7190-90542-0067.flac," four hour, two, three, i don't know how long. that horrible bundle swung over the fire, and the man sat on his black of wood, staring straight before him."
3459,7190-90542-0022.flac," there was a moon that night, wasn't there? fuller near it, i returned. and how soon was the alarm raised along the countryside?"
3460,7190-90542-0026.flac," one or two doppelplaces i had dug up. i think the murderer must have taken the head with him. to bury somewhere else, asked quarrels."
3461,7190-90542-0065.flac," were five or six human heads, blackened, shriveled faces, which seemed agree and horrible as they swung deeply from side to side, lit up by the flicker of the flame. do you see, wrigan? quiles asked again. yes."
3462,7190-90542-0009.flac, nor any papers in his pockets to lead to his identification. so far as could be ascertain.
3463,7190-90542-0038.flac," do you go armed? always, i answered. i do sometimes, he said, tapping his pocket. we might come up against danger if my theory is correct. if i tell you to shoot, shoot, and quickly."
3464,7190-90542-0028.flac," january the 17th. nearly the same date as the english one. said zina. two years intervening, i returned."
3465,7190-90542-0059.flac," i heard footsteps on the raised floor of the shed, a man's step, and only one man's. i heard him moving above for some time. i think he came down to latter once and went up again."
3466,7190-90542-0055.flac," we go with her again this evening, he said, after lunch next day. so a restful afternoon was soot us. it was getting dark when we set out, and it came quarrel as unhearing sense of locality astonished me. he led the way without hesitation."
3467,7190-90542-0035.flac," said quarrels. mind you, wiggin, i'm very duffel about my theory, at least i am not certain that i shall find the facts i want. if you hours will settle it one way or the other. after walking along the road for about a mile."
3468,7190-90542-0043.flac," once or twice the professor gave me a warning gesture, but he did not speak. he had evidently some definite goal, and i was conscious of excitement as i followed him. for an hour or more he turned this way in that, exploring every little orvening he could discover."
3469,7190-90542-0057.flac," but the professor was particular about our position. we may have to creep a little nearer presently, he whispered. from here we can do so. silence winging, and don't be astonished at anything. the waiting seemed long. moonlight was presently above us."
3470,7190-90542-0014.flac," and the murder had remained a mystery. these were the points known and conjectured when a case came into my hands, and my investigations added little to them. one point however impressed me. i felt convinced that the man's clothes, which was shown to me, had not been made in england."
3471,7190-90542-0049.flac," a pit, i call it, but it was as much a cave as a pit, part of it running deeply into the earth, and only about a third of it being open to this guy. the cave part had a rough sandy floor, and here was a long shed of peculiar construction."
3472,7190-90542-0015.flac," they were poor, worn almost threadbare, but they had once been fairly good, and the cut was not english. that it was french i could not possibly affirm, but it might be, and so i fashioned a fragile link with the normandy crime."
3473,7190-90542-0037.flac," should we meet anyone? blame me. say, i am a diadering old fool who would walk under the trees."
3474,7190-90542-0020.flac," which is continued as a division between two fields, which formed part of the farmland behind the wood. but walking along this the murderer might have left the wood without leaving tracks behind him. a good point, and where would that ditch lead him? eventually to the high road."
3475,7190-90542-0041.flac," to our right was a large house only partially seen through its screen of trees, but it was evidently mellow with age. to our left, toward what was evidently the extremity of the park, was hilly ground, which had been allowed to run wild."
3476,7190-90542-0045.flac," and yet this is such a likely place. there must be a way."" he was going forward again. the hollow was surrounded by perpendicular walls of sand and chalk. it was a pit, in fact, which nature had filled with vegetation. the way we had come seemed the only way into it."
3477,7190-90542-0003.flac," led to the solution of some strange mysteries, and, since my own achievements are sufficiently well-known, i may confine myself to those cases which single-handed i should have failed to solve. i know that many of them i was credited with having unraveled the mystery."
3478,7190-90542-0006.flac," perhaps his curious power was never more noticeable than in the case of the withon murder. a farmer returning from bedworth, the neighboring market town, one night in january."
3479,7190-90542-0060.flac," then there was a light and sudden tiny flames. in the dark he had evidently got fuel and had started the fire on the stone's lab. as the flames brightened, i watched his restless figure. he was not a young man."
3480,7190-90542-0034.flac," five or six miles, the road winds a lot. it's ideal nearer as the crow flies. you need not wait for us, trevor. my friend and i are going to walk back. the coachman pocketed his money and drove away. couldn't keep him waiting all night as we may have to do."
3481,7190-90542-0044.flac," granting his disappointment each time he failed to find what he was looking for. i said i wasn't certain. he whispered when our path had led us into a damp hollow, which looked as if it had not been visited by men for centuries. what there he seems?"
3482,7190-90542-0011.flac," soon after the storm began, a nitha snowhead hidden the murderers tracks from the wood. the snowhead drifted out into the dead body, seemed to establish this theory."
3483,7190-90542-0007.flac," by evening the clouds had gone, the moon sailed into clear sky, and looking round to find the cause of his horses unusual behavior, the farmer saw a man lying on a heap of snow under the opposite hedge. he was dead, more he was headless."
3484,7190-90542-0054.flac," he was always as secret as the grave until he had proved his theory, and then he seemed anxious to forget the whole affair, and shrank from publicity."
3485,7190-90542-0029.flac," at that date, said quarrels. you have a theory professor? and now, i'm just one, which would make you laugh. no, no, i do not like being laughed at. i never mentioned my theories until i have some facts to support them."
3486,7190-90542-0048.flac," we'll go carefully,"" said quarles. there may be worse than poacher's traps here. without help from me, he dropped from the roof, and i followed him. the natural passage was winding, and about fifty yards long, and opened into another pit of some size."
3487,7190-90542-0046.flac," ""'aww, this looks promising,' queryl said, suddenly, in a corner of the wall. or, to be more precise, filling up a rent in it was a shed, roughly built, but with a door secured by a very business-like lock. i think the shed is climbable!'"
3488,7190-90542-0031.flac," a few days later, quarles telegraphed me to meet him at king's cross, and we traveled north together. wait, he said when i began to question him. i am not sure yet, my theory seems absurd. we are going to find out if it is."
3489,7190-90542-0001.flac," as an excuse i talked over cases with him, but he seldom volunteered in opinion, often was obviously interested. truth to tell i was not there for his opinion, but to see his granddaughter, but a tech-tive in love sound something like an absurdity."
3490,7190-90542-0066.flac," and the man who is he on the bench yesterday, sir henry buckingham."
3491,7190-90542-0030.flac, i took the trouble to make inquiry whether any similar crime had happened in england in the january of the preceding year and had the same inquiry made in france. there was no record of any murder bearing the slightest resemblance to the width and tragedy.
3492,7190-90542-0012.flac," and would be found buried in the wood. it was not found, however, and the countryside was in a state bordering on panic. for a few days the wither murder seemed unique in atrocities, and then came a communication from the french police."
3493,7190-90542-0017.flac," whenever he was interested in the case, i was always taken into his empty room. at other times we were in the dining room with the drawing room. it was the empty room on this occasion, and zena remained with us."
3494,7190-90542-0040.flac," whether he had studied the topography of the neighborhood, i cannot say. but he did not hesitate in his direction until he reached a high knoll, which was clear of the wood and commanded a considerable view. we were trespassers in a private park."
3495,7190-90542-0023.flac," and after going to the village, the farmer returned a medworth for the police."
3496,7190-90542-0021.flac, which runs almost at right angles to the withen road. which water in the ditch asked quarrels? half a foot when i went there.
3497,7190-90542-0056.flac," i think we are first, but great care is necessary,"" he whispered. we crept forward and concealed ourselves, among the scrub vegetation which grew in that part of the pit which was open to the sky. it was dark, the long shed barely discernible."
3498,7190-90542-0052.flac, when? in about 30 hours time. the professor's sense of direction was marvelous.
3499,7190-90542-0010.flac, and apparently no struggle had taken place. footprints nearly obliterated.
3500,7190-90542-0004.flac," but this was only because professor quarles persisted in remaining in the background. if i did the spade work, the deductions were his. they were all cases what peculiar features in them."
3501,7190-90542-0019.flac," any traces that the head was carried to the wood? the local thirty say yes and not a trace afterward. the ground in the wood was searched at the time, and i have been over it carefully since. through one part of the wood, there runs a ditch."
3502,7190-90542-0013.flac," some two years ago, an almost identical murder had been committed outside of village in normandy. in this case, also the head was missing, and nothing had been found upon a body to identify the victim. he was well dressed, and a man who would be likely to carry papers with him, but nothing was found."
3503,7190-90542-0064.flac," from our new point of view i looked again. the man's face was familiar, but just then i could not remember who he was. it was the bundle hanging over the fire which fascinated me. tied together and secured in a network of string."
3504,7190-90542-0032.flac," we took rooms at a hotel in medworth. queryl's explaining that our investigation might take some days. next morning, instead of going to withen as i had expected, he took me to the police court."
3505,7190-90542-0039.flac," your life is likely to depend upon it, and keep yours open to make sure no one is following us. he had become keen like a dog on the trail, and, all as he was, seemed incapable of fatigue."
3506,7190-90542-0047.flac," said quarrels. let's get on the roof. i'm not so young as i was, so help me up. it was not much help he wanted. in a few moments we were on the roof. as i thought, he said."
3507,7190-90542-0053.flac, i dare say one would be allowed to see over the house.
3508,7190-90542-0062.flac," when he got down again, i saw that a bundle was suspended over the fire."
3509,7190-90542-0024.flac," said zina. and if you were met on the road carrying a bag, he would arrest attention. why are you carrying a bag? hest quarrels. with the head in it, she answered. that's another good point, wiggin? chuckled quarrels. of course."
3510,7190-90542-0025.flac," the head may be buried in the wood,"" said zena. quarles looked at me inquiringly."

3556,2911-7601-0030.flac," meantime, the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. it grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. the old man's terror must have been extreme. it grew louder, i say, louder every moment."
3557,2911-7601-0045.flac," and became more distinct. i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling, but it continued and gained definiteness. until at length i found that the noise was not within my ears. no doubt i now grew very pale, but i talked more fluently"
3558,2911-7601-0024.flac," stealthily, until at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider."

3561,2911-7601-0029.flac, but even yet are we framed and kept still? i scarcely breathed. i held the lantern motionless. i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray.
3562,2911-7601-0019.flac," deepening with its dreadful echo, the terrors at distracted me. i say i knew it well, i knew what the old man felt, and pityed him, although i chuckled at heart."
3563,2911-7601-0038.flac," no blood spot, whatever. i had been too wary for that. a tub had caught all."
3564,2911-7601-0031.flac," do you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous? so i am, and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror."
3565,2911-7601-0020.flac," when he had turned in the bed. his fears had been ever since growing upon him. he had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. he had been sane to himself. it is nothing but the wind in the chimney."
3566,2911-7601-0021.flac," it is only a mouse crossing the floor, or it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp. yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions, but he had found all in vain. all in vain because death."

3568,2911-7601-0016.flac," for whole hour i did not move a muscle, and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down. he was still sitting up in the bed listening, just as i have done, night after night, harkening to the death watches in the wall."
3569,2911-7601-0008.flac," or you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in. i moved it slowly, very, very slowly, so that i may not disturb the old man's sleep. it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening."
3570,2911-7601-0012.flac," never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers, of my sagacity. i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph, to think that there i was, opening the door, little by little."
3571,2911-7601-0005.flac," i made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. now this is the point. you fancy me mad. mad men know nothing, but you should have seen me. you should have seen how wisely i proceeded."
3572,2911-7601-0003.flac, it haunted me day and night. object there was none. passion there was none. i loved the old man. he had never wronged me. he had never given me insult. for his gold i had no desire. i think it was his eye.
3573,2911-7601-0006.flac," with what caution, with what foresight, with what dissimulation i went to work. i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him. and every night, about midnight, i turned the latch of his door and opened it."
3574,2911-7601-0010.flac," for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his evil eye. in every morning, when the day broke, i went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night."
3575,2911-7601-0043.flac," placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. the officers were satisfied. my manner had convinced them. i was singularly at ease. they sat, and while i answered cheerily,"
3576,2911-7601-0009.flac," so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed. ha, when a mad man had been so wise as this, and then, when my head was well in the room, i undid the lantern cautiously, oh, so cautiously."
3577,2911-7601-0014.flac," his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, for the shutters were closed fast through fear of robbers. and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door."
3578,2911-7601-0047.flac," i talked more quickly, more vehemently, but the noise steadily increased. i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations. but the noise steadily increased. why would they not be gone?"
3579,2911-7601-0049.flac," i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting, and graded it upon the boards. but the noise arose overall and continually increased. it grew louder, louder, louder, and still the men shatted pleasantly and smiled."
3580,2911-7601-0007.flac," also gently. and then, when i had made an opening sufficient for my head, i put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then i thrust in my head."
3581,2911-7601-0035.flac," i removed the bed and examined the corpse. yes, he was stone-stone dead. i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. there was no pulsation. he was stone dead. his eye would trouble me no more."
3582,2911-7601-0032.flac," yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still. but the beating grew louder, louder. i thought the heart must burst, and now a new anxiety sees me. the sound would be heard by a neighbor. the old man's hour had come."
3583,2911-7601-0051.flac," but anything was better than this agony. anything was more tolerable than this derision. i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer. i felt that i must scream or die. and now again, hark, louder, louder."
3584,2911-7601-0048.flac," i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men, but the noise steadily increased. oh, god, what could i do? i foamed, i raved, i swore."
3585,2911-7601-0034.flac," to find the deed so far done. but for many minutes the heartbeat on with a muffled sound. this, however, did not vex me, it would not be heard through the wall, at length it ceased. the old man was dead."
3586,2911-7601-0028.flac," such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. i knew that sound well, too. it was the beating of the old man's heart. it increased my fury as the beating of a drum simulates the soldier into courage."
3587,2911-7601-0026.flac," with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones. but i could see nothing else of the old man's face, or person, for i had directed the ray as if my instinct precisely upon the damn spot."
3588,2911-7601-0022.flac," in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. and it was the mournful influence of the unprocieved shadow that caused him to feel, although he neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence of my head within the room."
3589,2911-7601-0037.flac," and deposited all between the scantlings. i then replaced the board so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye, not even his, could have detected anything wrong. there was nothing to wash out, no stain of any kind,"
3590,2911-7601-0039.flac," it was four o'clock, still dark as midnight. as the bells sounded the hour, they came a knocking at the street door. i went down to open it with a light heart. for what had i now to fear? there entered three men who introduced themselves,"
3591,2911-7601-0004.flac," yes, it was this. he had the eye of a vulture, a pale blue eye, with a film over it. whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, very gradually, and gradually,"
3592,2911-7601-0002.flac," i heard many things in hell. how then am i mad? harkin and observe how healthily, how calmly i can tell you the whole story. it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain, but once conceived,"
3593,2911-7601-0050.flac," was it possible they heard not? almighty god, no! no, they heard. they suspected. they knew. they were making a mockery of my horror. this i thought, and this i think."
3594,2911-7601-0023.flac," when i had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, i resolved to open a little, a very, very little crevice in the lantern. so i opened it. you cannot imagine how stealthily."
3595,2911-7601-0040.flac," with perfect swaviti as officers of the police. a shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night, suspicion of foul play had been aroused. information had been lodged at the police office. and they, the officers,"
3596,2911-7601-0015.flac," steadily. i had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin-fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out, ""'who's there?' i kept quite still, and said nothing."
3597,2911-7601-0027.flac," and have i not told you that what new mistake for madness is but overacuteness of the sense? now i say, there came to my ears,"
3598,2911-7601-0001.flac, above all was a sense of hearing acute. i heard all things in heaven.
3599,2911-7601-0041.flac," had been deputed to search the premises. i smiled, for what had i to fear? i bid the gentleman welcome. the shriek, i said, was my own in a dream. the old man i mentioned was absent in the country."
3600,2911-7601-0017.flac," presently, i heard a slight groan, and i knew it was a groan of mortal terror. it was not a groan of pain or of grief, oh no."
3601,2911-7601-0046.flac," and with a heightened voice, yet the sound increased, and what could i do? it was a low, dull, quick sound. much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. i gasped for breath, and yet the officers heard it not."
3602,2911-7601-0018.flac," when overcharged with awe. i knew this sound well. many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept."
3603,2911-15045-0004.flac," and from the carolinas to hudson's bay, was divided between two great families of tribes, distinguished by a radical difference of language. a part of virginia and of pennsylvania, new jersey, sotheastern new york, new england,"
3604,2911-15045-0000.flac," north and south, tribe was giving place to tribe, language to language. for the indian, hopelessly unchanging in respect to individual and social development, was, as regarded tribal relations and local haunts,"
3605,2911-15045-0024.flac," tomorrow all again was solitude, and the ottawa was covered with the canoes of the returning warriors. along this stream, a main route of traffic, the silence of the wilderness was broken only by the splash of the passing paddle."
3606,2911-15045-0027.flac," then, after many a day of lonely travel, the voyager found a savage welcome among the nipisings, on the lake which bears their name, and then circling west and south for 150 miles of solitude."
3607,2911-15045-0006.flac, westward the eri's along the southern shore of lake eri and the neutral nation along its northern shore from de agra
3608,2911-15045-0022.flac," and as the voyager passed some wooded point, or thicket-covered island, the whistling of a stone-headed arrow proclaimed, perhaps, the presence of these fierce marauders. at montreal there was no human life, saved during a brief space in early summer,"
3609,2911-15045-0026.flac, it was nearly 300 miles by the windings of the stream before one reached that algonquin tribe.
3610,2911-15045-0011.flac," or prowling warrior. we have said that this group of tribes was relatively very populous, yet it is more than doubtful whether all of them united, had union been possible, could have mustered 8,000 fighting men. to speak further of them is needless."
3611,2911-15045-0028.flac," he reached for the first time a people speaking a dialect of the iraquatong. here all was changed. popular towns, rude fortifications, and an extensive, though barbarous, tillage,"
3612,2911-15045-0008.flac," to which the wandering hunter-tribes were often reduced. they owed much, also, to the bounty of the sea, and hence they tended toward the coast, which, before the epidemic, champlain and smith had seen, at many points studded with wigwams."
3613,2911-15045-0029.flac," indicated a people far in advance of the famished wanderers of the saginae, or the less abject kindred of new england."
3614,2911-15045-0015.flac," had no tenets but hunters. northward, between the st. lawrence and hudson's bay, rome the scattered hordes of the papinichois, bethesia mites, and others, included by the french under the general name"
3615,2911-15045-0018.flac," their ordinary sustenance was derived from the chase. though often, goaded by deadly famine, they would subsist on roots, the bark, and buds of trees."
3616,2911-15045-0021.flac," a noted place of trade, where a few algonquins of the tribe called attica manguiz might possibly be seen."
3617,2911-15045-0001.flac," mutable as the wind. in canada and the northern section of the united states, the elements of change were especially active. the indian population, which, in 1535, cartier found at montreal and quebec."
3618,2911-15045-0017.flac, and setting up their bark wigwams along the strand of that wild harbor.
3619,2911-15045-0012.flac, and the whole of new brunswick were occupied.
3620,2911-15045-0007.flac," on the whole, these savages were favorable specimens of the algonquin stock. beglling to that section of it, which tilled the soil, and was thus in some measure, spared the extremes of misery and degradation,"
3621,2911-15045-0020.flac," from the verge of the cliff, announced that the savage prologue of the american drama was drawing to a close, and that the civilization of europe was advancing on the scene. ascending further, all was solitude, except at three rivers,"
3622,2911-15045-0002.flac," had disappeared at the opening of the next century, and another race had succeeded in language and customs widely different. while in the region now forming the state of new york, a power was rising to a ferocious vitality, which"
3623,2911-15045-0009.flac, and waving with harvests of maize. fear too drove them eastward for the iraquois pursued them with an inveterate emnity. some paid yearly tribute to their tyrants while others were still subject to their inroads.
3624,2911-15045-0023.flac, when the shore swarmed the savages who had come to the yearly trade from the great communities of the interior.
3625,2911-15045-0003.flac," but for the presence of europeans, would probably have subjected, absorbed, or exterminated every other indian community east of the mississippi and north of the ohio. the vast tract of wilderness from the mississippi to the atlantic,"
3626,2911-15045-0019.flac," and in extreme, even cannibalism was not rare among them. ascending the st. lawrence, it was seldom that the sight of a human form gave relief to the loneliness."
3627,2911-15045-0025.flac," to the north of the river, there was indeed a small agonquin band called the petite nation, together with one or two other feeble communities. but they dwelt far from the banks through fear of the ubiquitous yurkwa."
3628,2911-15045-0010.flac," flying in terror at the sound of the mohawk war cry. westward, the population, thinned rapidly. northward, it soon disappeared. northern new hampshire, the whole of vermont, and western massachusetts, had no human tenants, but the roving hunter,"
3629,2911-15045-0013.flac," to whom agriculture was unknown. though the sea, prolific of fish, lobsters, and seals greatly enlighten their miseries."
3630,2911-15045-0014.flac," or mickmax of nova scotia, closely resembled them in habit and condition. from nova scotia to the st. lawrence, there was no population worthy of the name. from the gulf of st. lawrence to lake ontario, the southern border of the great river,"
3631,2911-15045-0005.flac," new brunswick, nova scotia, and lower canada were occupied, so far as occupied at all, by tribes speaking various algonquin languages and dialects. they extended more over along the shores of the upper lakes,"
3632,2911-15045-0016.flac," when in spring, the french trading ships arrived and anchored in the port of tedussec. they gathered from far and near, toiling painfully through the desolation of forests, mustering by hundreds at the point of traffic."
3633,3486-166446-0021.flac," an ecstasy of tenderness, a flame of unearthly rapture, trembled over the woman's wondrous face. hungryly, defiantly, she pressed the girl to her. the stars in the lucid heavens of her eyes were soft and gentle and caressing."
3634,3486-166446-0037.flac," these creatures that when many still are one, that when one still are many, once did they come, what are they? he looks down upon the cubes that held us. their hosts of tiny eyes shown up at him, enigmatically."
3635,3486-166446-0009.flac," i suppose they ought to be grateful, although their intentions were not exactly therapeutic. they tortured him. ruth's voice was tense, bitter. she spoke in persian, for norhal's benefit i thought, then, not guessing a deeper reason."
3636,3486-166446-0031.flac," the thing quieted. it began its steady effortless striding through the crowding trees. but now was none of that speed with which it had come, spurred forward by no-holas-wakened hate. ventner stirred."
3637,3486-166446-0027.flac," safe for the bridge of our voices, it separated us from ruth as though she stood upon another world. higher we rose. the three of us now upon the flat top of a tower, upon whose counterpart 50 feet away,"
3638,3486-166446-0042.flac," it was no globe, it was a world of many facets of smooth and polished planes."
3639,3486-166446-0014.flac," and it was well done, sister. now you and i shall dwell together in peace, sister. or if there be those in the world from which you came that you would have slain?"
3640,3486-166446-0017.flac," and it last, it was twin sister of norhalla who looked upon her from the face of ruth. the white arms of the woman encircled her, the glorious head bent over her, flaming trusses mingled with tender brown curls."
3641,3486-166446-0041.flac," in it, something ominous, something sinister, it swirled to a crescendo abruptly ceased, and now i saw norhalla raise her head. listen. i saw a world, a vast world goodwin, marching stately through space."
3642,3486-166446-0005.flac," but in the eyes of ruth was none of this. sternly, coldly triumphant and different to its pideousness, as nora holler herself, she scanned the waste that less than an hour since had been a place of living beauty. i felt a shock of repulsion, after all."
3643,3486-166446-0008.flac," there was dried blood on the edges, a double ring of swollen white flesh rimming the cincher. it was the mark of torture martin i cried that ring what did they do to you? they waked me with that answered quietly"
3644,3486-166446-0039.flac," as i told you, or think i told you, speaking with unthinkable effort through lips that seem deternity is away from me, the adam who strove to open them."
3645,3486-166446-0043.flac," a geometric thought of the great cause of god, if you will, made material. it was airless, waterless, sunless."
3646,3486-166446-0038.flac," as though they heard and understood. i do not forget, he said. at least not all do i forget of what i saw during that time when i seemed an atom outside space."
3647,3486-166446-0032.flac," purged not only by suffering but by it came to me some strange knowledge no use drake, he said dreamily"
3648,3486-166446-0034.flac," it is the crisis he answered. we can do nothing, goodwin, nothing. whatever is to be steps forth now from the womb of destiny. again, there came that distant rolling, louder now. again, the thing trembled."
3649,3486-166446-0012.flac," before my eyes they tortured my brother, norhalla, they were evil, all evil. norhalla, you did well to slay them. she got the woman's hands pressed close to her."
3650,3486-166446-0010.flac," they tortured him, they gave him agony until he returned, and they promised him other agonies that would make him pray long for death. and me, me, she raised little clenched hands."
3651,3486-166446-0030.flac," stood for an instant at the brink of the green forest. there came to us, as though from immeasurable distances, a faint sustained thrumming, like the beating of countless muffled drums, the thing that carried us trembled the sound died away."
3652,3486-166446-0036.flac," and as motionless ruth, martin, i cried once more, a dreadful dad upon me. martin, what do you mean? whenst did they come? his voice was clear and calm, the eyes beneath."
3653,3486-166446-0011.flac, me they stripped like a slave they led me through the city and the people mocked me
3654,3486-166446-0016.flac," and as they rose, steadily they drew life from the clear radiant summoning, drew closer to the semblance of that tranquil spirit, which revenge had banished."
3655,3486-166446-0018.flac," sister, she whispered, little sister, these men you shall have, as long as it pleases you to do with as you will, or if it is your wish they shall go back to their world and i will guard them to its gates."
3656,3486-166446-0033.flac," but this i do know, only one way or another can the balance fall. and if it be one way, then you and we shall have ruth back. and if it falls the other way, then there will be little need for us to care for. man will be done. martin, what do you mean?"
3657,3486-166446-0006.flac," yet mother and blossoming maid, youth and oldster, all the pageant of humanity, within the great walls were now but lines within the stone. according to their different lights, it came to me, there had been..."
3658,3486-166446-0029.flac," silently we streamed through the chasm, through the canyon and the tunnel, speaking no word, drake's eyes fixed with bitter hatred upon norhalla, ventner brooding upon her always with that enigmatic sympathy, we passed between the walls of the further cleft."
3659,3486-166446-0026.flac," it was as though norhalla had decreed it as a symbol of this her second victory, or had said it between us as a barrier. wider grew the rift."
3660,3486-166446-0023.flac," there was a curious understanding in his voice, a curious sympathy, too. in the patient, untroubled gaze that dwelt upon his sister, and this weirdly exquisite woman who held her. wait, exclaimed a drake. wait, hell, the damned witch is stealing her away from us."
3661,3486-166446-0025.flac," like metal waves back into it rushed the enigmatic billows that had washed over the fragments of the city. we were lifted between us and the woman and girl, a cleft appeared, it widened into a rift."
3662,3486-166446-0007.flac," from rohala, of course, i looked for no perception of any of this, but from ruth. my reaction grew."
3663,3486-166446-0004.flac, dwelt curiously upon the red brand across ventner's forehead.
3664,3486-166446-0003.flac," now, in the painful surges of awakening realization, a full human understanding of that inhuman annihilation, i turned to them for strength. faintly, i wondered again at ruth's scantiness of garb, her more than half nudity."
3665,3486-166446-0019.flac," but you and i, little sister, will dwell together in the vastness, in the peace. shall it not be so? with no faltering, with no glance toward us three."
3666,3486-166446-0020.flac," lever, brother, old friend, ruth crept closer to her, rested her head upon the virginal royal breasts. it shall be so, she murmured, sister, it shall be so. norhalla, i am tired, norhalla, i've seen enough of men."
3667,3486-166446-0035.flac," is it taps for them? the drumming died as i listened, fearfully. about us was only the swishing, the sighing of the falling trees beneath the tread of the thing. motionless did norhalla."
3668,3486-166446-0028.flac," quietly it glided to the chasm it had blasted in the cliff wall. the shadow of those walls fell upon us. as one we looked back, as one we searched out the path of blue, with the black blot at its breast, we found it, then the precipices hid it."
3669,3486-166446-0015.flac," then you and i shall go forth with our companies and stamp them out even as i did these. my heart stopped beating. for from the depths of ruth's eyes shining shadows were rising, rates answering or hollows calling."
3670,3486-166446-0000.flac," chapter 27. the drums of destiny. slowly we descended that mount of desolation lingeringly, as though the brooding eyes of nor hollow were not yet sated with destruction."
3671,3486-166446-0013.flac," norholy gazed at her from great grey eyes in which sirath was dying, into which the old tranquility, the old serenity was flowing, and when she spoke the golden voice held more than returning echoes of the faraway faint chimings. it is done, she said."
3672,3486-166446-0024.flac," again, he threw himself forward, recoiled as though swept back by an invisible arm, fell against us and was clasped and held by ventner, and as he struggled, the thing we rode halted."
3673,3486-166446-0002.flac," palace, temple, and home. nor hala had stamped flat. she had crushed them within the rock, even as she had promised. their tremendous tragedy had absorbed my every faculty."
3674,3486-166446-0040.flac," revelations, i know not what to call them, and though each seemed equally real, of two of them, only one i think can be true, and of the third that may sometime be true, but surely is not yet. through the air came a louder drum roll."
3675,3486-166446-0022.flac," ruth cried drake and sprang toward them. she paid no heed, and even as he leapt he was caught, world back against us. wait, said ventiner."
3676,3486-166446-0001.flac," of human life, of green life, of life of any kind, there was none."
3677,3486-166424-0024.flac," nature is summoning of every reserve to meet that peril. my eyes took them in with photographic nicety. the linked male, lacquered blue and scarlet of the horseman. brown, padded armor of the footmen."
3678,3486-166424-0045.flac," globes and cubes and pyramids, not small like those of the ruins, but shapes all of four-feet high, duly lustrous, and deep within that lust are the myriads of tiny points of light like unwinking, staring eyes."
3679,3486-166424-0065.flac," rested my gaze from the hollow, turned, giley, fainting in drake's arms. beside the two, the swathed woman stood, looking out upon that slaughter, calm and still, strutted with an unearthly tranquility."
3680,3486-166424-0001.flac," of what powers, small like these or, or... quick on the screen of my mind flashed two pictures, side by side."
3681,3486-166424-0071.flac, it threw them broken and torn far toward the valley-sloping sides. it left only fragments that bore no semblance to men. ventiner was at chumings' head. i dropped beside him. there was a crimson throath upon his lips.
3682,3486-166424-0002.flac," the little forerade print in the great dust of the crumbling ruin and its colossal twin on the breast of the poppy valley. i turned aside, crept through the shattered portal, and looked over the haunted hollow. unbelieving, i rubbed my eyes."
3683,3486-166424-0000.flac," as i cased upon them, i wondered to what secret place within their brooding amensities the little metal mysteries had fled, and to what myriads it might be of their kind."
3684,3486-166424-0055.flac," they sliced into the close packed forward ranks of the armored men, cut out of them two great gaps. sick and i saw fragments of man in a horse fly. another arm javelin from its place, like a flying snake, clicked at the end of another."
3685,3486-166424-0057.flac," all that host, which had driven us from the ruins, threw down sword, spear, and pike, fled, shrieking, the horsemen spurred their mounts, riding heedless over the footmen who fled with them. the smiting thing seemed to watch them go."
3686,3486-166424-0053.flac," preening, testing itself like an athlete."
3687,3486-166424-0063.flac," it was, i think, that last touch of sheer horror, the plaitfulness of the smiting thing that sent my dry tongue to the roof of my tear, parched mouth, and held open with monstrous fascination eyes that struggled to close."
3688,3486-166424-0009.flac," down it was pouring an avalanche of men. i caught the glint of helmets and corslets. those in the van were mounted, galloping to a breast upon sure-footed mountain ponies. their short swords lifted high, flickered."
3689,3486-166424-0020.flac," we dropped upon our knees, sent shot after shot into them. they fell back, hesitated. we sprang up, sped on. all too short was the check, but once more we held them. and again. now ruth and dick were a scant 50 yards from the crevice. i saw him stop."
3690,3486-166424-0047.flac, up from them thrust a thick rectangular column.
3691,3486-166424-0016.flac," he reached out, touched me. you're right walter, he grinned. it does seem like carrying coals to newcastle."
3692,3486-166424-0049.flac," with magical quickness the arms lengthened. before us stirred a monstrous shape, a geometric prodigy."
3693,3486-166424-0011.flac," the rush was checked for an instant, milling upon the road. dick, i cried, rush-ruth over to the tunnel mouth. we'll follow. we can hold them there. i'll get martin, tuming after the pony quick. i pushed the two over the rim of the hollow."
3694,3486-166424-0004.flac," a hair set upright in the middle of the ancient roadway. the valley itself lay serenely under the ambering light, smiling, peaceful, empty to forer."
3695,3486-166424-0039.flac," they stood in silence, like automatons only their fiercely staring eyes showing that they were alive. quick, breathed ventner. we ran toward her who had checked death even while its jaws were closing upon us."
3696,3486-166424-0034.flac," they've shown from her white face, not phosphorescent, not merely loosened and light reflecting, but as though they themselves were sources of the cold white flames of far stars, and as calm as those stars themselves."
3697,3486-166424-0040.flac," before we had gone halfway, as though our flight had broken whatever bonds had bound them, a clamor arose from the host, a wild shouting, a clanging of swords on shields. i shot a glance behind. they were in motion, advancing slowly."
3698,3486-166424-0007.flac, even the ruins had lost their sinister shape. were time-worn crumbling piles. nothing more.
3699,3486-166424-0067.flac," were they maddened by fear, driven by despair, determined to slay before they themselves were slain? i do not know. but those who still lived, from the men from the tunnel mouth, were charging us. they clustered close. their shields held before them."
3700,3486-166424-0070.flac," i saw a spear thrown, it struck the chinaman squarely in the breast, he tottered, fell upon his knees. even as he dropped the giant flail swept down upon the soldiers, it swept through them like a sithe, through ripe grain."
3701,3486-166424-0010.flac," after the horsemen swarmed foot soldiers, a forest of shining points and dully gleaming pike above them, clearly to us came their battle cries. again, ventaners rifle cracked. one of the foremost riders went down, another stumbled over him, fell."
3702,3486-166424-0028.flac," we've saved ruth anyway, he said. drake got to be able to hold that hole in the wall. he's got lots of ammunition on the pony, but they've got us. another wild shouting. down swept the pack."
3703,3486-166424-0052.flac," again, in gigantic, awful parody of the spiked gloves of those ancient gladiators who fought for imperial nero."
3704,3486-166424-0037.flac," i saw the two walk toward her, two ming hang back. the great eyes fell upon ventner and myself. she raised a hand, motioned us to approach. i turned. there stood the host that had poured down the mountain road."
3705,3486-166424-0075.flac," high up in the darkening heavens, the lamer gears, the winged scavengers of the himalayas were gathering. the woman lifted her hand, back in dust once more. slowly we walked toward her, stood before her."
3706,3486-166424-0013.flac," all my ammunition is on him. jumming's taking care of that, i guess. we darted out to the gateway, a good 500 yards away were roofed and rake running straight to the green tunnel's mouth. between them and us was jumming, urging on the pony."
3707,3486-166424-0036.flac," the woman stepped from the crevice, not fifty feet from her were ruth and drake and chouming. their rigid attitudes revealed the same shock of awe that had momentarily paralyzed me. she looked at them, beckoned them."
3708,3486-166424-0046.flac," they swirled, eddyed, and formed a barricade between us and the armored men. down upon them poured a shower of arrows from the soldiers. i heard the shouts of their captains. they rushed. they had courage, those men, yes. again came the woman's cry."
3709,3486-166424-0042.flac," their gaze fastened upon the swathed woman. ventiner's hand shut out, gripped my shoulder, halted me. she had thrown up her head."
3710,3486-166424-0056.flac," became a hundred-foot chain which swirled like a flail through the huddling mass. down upon a knot of the soldiers with a straight forward blow drove a third arm, driving through them like a giant punch."
3711,3486-166424-0038.flac," horseman, spearsman, pikeman, a full thousand of them, at my right were the scattered company that had come from the tunnel entrance, three score or more. there seemed to spell upon them."
3712,3486-166424-0026.flac," in this world of ours, 20 centuries beyond their time. swiftly, accurately, even as i scanned them we had been drilling into them. they advanced deliberately, heedless of their fallen. their arrows had ceased to fly."
3713,3486-166424-0012.flac," quick, mart, i shouted, up the shuttered stairway. we can get through the hollow, roof and draker on their way to the break we came through. hurry. alright, just a minute he called. i heard him empty his magazine with almost machine-gun quickness."
3714,3486-166424-0015.flac," fell far short. don't look back, grunt adventurer. stretch yourself, walter. there's a surprise coming. hope to god i judge the time right. we turned off the ruined way."
3715,3486-166424-0066.flac," viewing it, it came to me with eyes impersonal, cold, indifferent as the untroubled stars which look down upon hurricane and earthquake in this world of ours. there was a rushing of many feet at our left, a whale from chuming."
3716,3486-166424-0043.flac," from the lifted throat came a low, a vibrant cry harmonious, weirdly disquieting golden and sweet and laden with the eerie minor whalings of the blue valley's night, the dragon chamber."
3717,3486-166424-0025.flac," their bows and javelins and short bronze swords, their pikes and shields, and under their round helmets, their cruel bearded faces, white as our own, where the black beards did not cover them, their fierce and mocking eyes."
3718,3486-166424-0027.flac, i wondered why for now we were well within their range.
3719,3486-166424-0031.flac," a woman beautiful, awesome, incredible. she was tall standing there swathed from chin to feet in clinging veils of pale amber. she seemed taller even than tall drake."
3720,3486-166424-0059.flac," they scattered, running singly by twos and little groups. for the sides of the valley, they were like rats scampering in panic over the bottom of a great green bowl, and like a monstrous cat, the shape played with them. yes, played."
3721,3486-166424-0060.flac," it melted once more, it took new form. where had been a pillar in flailing arms was now a tripod 30 feet high, its legs alternate globe and cube, and upon its apex a wide and spinning ring of sparkling spheres."
3722,3486-166424-0022.flac," a chance, gasp, and there. behind us was a wolf-like yelping. the first pack had reformed, had crossed the barricade, the dynamite had made, was rushing upon us. i ran as i had never known i could."
3723,3486-166424-0051.flac, flexing themselves in grotesque imitation of a boxer.
3724,3486-166424-0019.flac," drake heard, before he changed his course to the crevice, at whose mouth ruth had said the little things had lain. after him streaked to ming, urging on the pony, shouting out of the tunnel, down over the lip of the bull, leapt the soldiers."
3725,3486-166424-0021.flac," push her from him toward it. she shook her head. now chiu ming was with them. ruth sprang to the pony, lifted from its back a rifle. then into the mass of their pursuers, drake and shi poured a fuselage. they huddled, wavered, broke for cover."
3726,3486-166424-0006.flac," gone was that soul of loneliness, vanished the whirlpool of despair that had striven to drag us down to death. the bowl was nothing but a quiet, smiling, lovely little hollow in the hills. i looked back."
3727,3486-166424-0014.flac," as we sped after him, i looked back. the horsemen had recovered, where now a scant half mile from where the road swept past the fortress. i saw that with their swords, the horsemen bore great bows, a little cloud of arrows sparkled from them."
3728,3486-166424-0069.flac," i heard schumeng scream, saw him throw up his hands, cover his eyes, run straight upon the pikes. schumeng i shouted, schumeng this way. i ran toward him."
3729,3486-166424-0073.flac," at the sight of the crevice stood the woman, her gaze resting upon drake, his arms about ruth, her head hidden on his breast. the valley was empty, save for the huddled heaps that dotted it."
3730,3486-166424-0072.flac," i thought that shinji was about to slay us, he whispered, fear blinded me. his head dropped, his body quivered, lay still. we arose, looked about us, dayzedly."
3731,3486-166424-0048.flac," 8 feet in width and 20 feet high, it shaped itself. out from its left side, from right side, spring arms, fearful arms, that grew and grew, as globe and cube and angle raced up the column side and clicked into place, each upon, each after the other."
3732,3486-166424-0023.flac," over us, wind the bullets from the covering guns. close where we now, to the mouth of the fisher. if we could but reach it. close. close where our pursuers to. the arrows closer. no youths, said ventner."
3733,3486-166424-0061.flac," out from the middle of this ring stretched atentical, writhing, undulating like a serpent of steel, four score yards at least in length."
3734,3486-166424-0018.flac," and holding ruth by the hand, race back toward us. even as he turned, the vine screened entrance through which we had come, through which we had thought lay safety, streamed other armored men, we were outflanked. to the fisher, shout-out, vendor."
3735,3486-166424-0074.flac," high up on the mountain path, the score of figures crept. all that were left of those, who but a little before had streamed down to take us captive or to slay."
3736,3486-166424-0064.flac," ever the armored men fled from it, and ever was it swifter than they teetering at their heels on its tripod legs from half its length the darting snake streamed red rain. i heard a sigh from ruth"
3737,3486-166424-0058.flac," with amusement. before they could cover 100 yards that had disintegrated, i heard the little wailing sounds, then behind the fleeing men, close behind them, rose the angled pillar into place sprang the flexing arms, and again it took its toll of them."
3738,3486-166424-0029.flac," we left to our feet, sent our last bullets into them, stood ready, rifles clubbed to meet the rush. i heard ruth scream. what was the matter with the armored men? why had they halted?"
3739,3486-166424-0008.flac," a rifle shot rang out above us, another, and another, from the portals campered, two-ming his robe tucked up about his knees. they come, he gasped. they come."
3740,3486-166424-0035.flac," and in that face, although as yet i could distinguish nothing but the eyes, i sensed something unearthly. god was preventive. what is she?"
3741,3486-166424-0062.flac," with the three long prongs of this trident, the thing struck swiftly."
3742,3486-166424-0050.flac," a shining angular pillar that, though rigid, immobile, seemed to crouch, be instinct with living force striving to be unleashed. two great globes are mounted it."
3743,3486-166424-0041.flac," hesitatingly is yet, but i knew that soon that hesitation would pass, that they would sweep down upon us and gulph us. to the crevice i shatted to drake, he paid no heed to me nor did ruth."
3744,3486-166424-0068.flac," they had no bows, these men. they moved swiftly down upon us in silence, swords and pikes gleaming. the smiting thing rocked toward us, the metal tentacles straining out like a rigid, racing serpent, flying to cut between its weird mistress and those who minister."
3745,3486-166424-0054.flac," under the darkening sky, in the green of the hollow, the armored hosts frozen before it. and then it struck. outflashed two of the arms with a glancing motion, with a pauling force."
3746,3486-166424-0030.flac," what was it at which they were glaring over our heads, and why had the rifle fire of ruth and drake ceased so abruptly? simultaneously, we turned. within the black background of the fishers stood a shape, an apparition."
3747,3486-166424-0032.flac," yet it was not her height that sent through me the thrill of awe, of half incredulous terror, which, relaxing my grip, let my smoking rifle dropped the earth. nor was it that about her proud head, a cloud of shining tresses, swirled, and pen-n-ed."
3748,3486-166424-0005.flac," i dropped over the site, walked cautiously down the road, up which but an hour so before we had struggled so desperately, paced farther and farther with an increasing confidence and a growing wonder."
3749,3486-166424-0044.flac," before the cried ceased, their poured, with incredible swiftness out of the crevice score upon score of the metal things. the fishers vomited them."
3750,3486-166424-0033.flac," like a misty banner of woven copper flames. no, nor that through her veils her body gleamed faint radiance. it was her eyes, her great wide eyes, whose clear depths were like pools of living starfires."
3751,3486-166424-0017.flac," scattered prone among these were men and horses, others staggered, screaming. on the further side of this stony dyke, our pursuers were held like rushing waters behind a sudden fallen tree. time to a second, cried fentner. hold him for a while."
3752,3486-166424-0003.flac," then leapt to the very brim of the bull. a lark had risen from the roof of one of the shadowteeps and had flown caroling up into the shadowy sky. a flock of the little willow boar-blurs flung themselves across the valley, scolding and gossiping."
3753,125-121124-0032.flac," she could not endure that insult offered to us by that wretch, so she asked permission to travel. and is she gone? the other night she left."
3754,125-121124-0022.flac," but whom are you seeking, debrae? i am seeking the count of monte cristo, said the young man."
3755,125-121124-0020.flac," it has been mentioned, but the article is not mine."
3756,125-121124-0075.flac," from 12 to 1300,000 francs, but to return to our millions."
3757,125-121124-0008.flac," everything. and indeed, no sooner had the doctor left the room that he was again absorbed in study."
3758,125-121124-0063.flac, but did you receive my letter yesterday? yes. i have brought my receipt.
3759,125-121124-0067.flac, and who bowed to me as though he knew me?
3760,125-121124-0009.flac," a persona just insignificant in our story, as in the world he occupied. one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others. he was punctual, dressed in black, with cray-browned his hat."
3761,125-121124-0077.flac," now i think of it, you can do better, said dunglar. how do you mean?"
3762,125-121124-0040.flac," our neapolitan bonds,"" said monte cristo. no, said dunglar smiling."
3763,125-121124-0062.flac, the charities present themselves to you through me. the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five million from you.
3764,125-121124-0057.flac," i never joke with bankers, sid monte cristo, in a freezing manner, which repelled in pertinence."
3765,125-121124-0003.flac, and they both returned thoughtfully to the procurer's study.
3766,125-121124-0007.flac," shall you be present in the reception room? no, i have a cousin who was undertaken this sad office. i shall work, doctor."
3767,125-121124-0046.flac," you therefore still owe me 5 million and 100,000 francs. i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the 6 million between us."
3768,125-121124-0047.flac, and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand.
3769,125-121124-0018.flac, the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us. who is he?
3770,125-121124-0060.flac," at the door, he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank."
3771,125-121124-0002.flac, he sleeps indeed. and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night.
3772,125-121124-0043.flac," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sin monte cristo. 5 million. why? what a crosser you are. this is how i transact business, said donglar's. it is really wonderful, said the count, above all."
3773,125-121124-0072.flac, i will set before him the example of madame de morseff and her son. what example? they gave all their fortune to the hospitals. what fortune? their own.
3774,125-121124-0038.flac," that reminds me, he said, that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds. i have already signed two. will you allow me to do the same to the others? pray do so."
3775,125-121124-0044.flac," it is indeed,"" said douglas. it is a fine thing to have such credit. really, it is only in france these things are done. five million on five little scraps of paper. it must be seen to be believed."
3776,125-121124-0011.flac," equally pleased to witness the festivities or the morning of the rich, and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess. gradually the reception room filled."
3777,125-121124-0001.flac," which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life. this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambrick,"
3778,125-121124-0056.flac," there is still a sum of 100,000 francs. o, a mere nothings in monte cristo. the balance would come to about that sum, but keep it and we shall be quits."" count, said dunglard. are you speaking seriously?"
3779,125-121124-0023.flac," his banker, tanglauses his banker, is he not? asked chateau reno of debris. i believe so, replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here. i do not see morrell."
3780,125-121124-0026.flac," for indeed, misfortune has taken possession of my house. when i perceived you, i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor myself, which would have justified the proverb of"
3781,125-121124-0051.flac," that is being rest from its grasp. suddenly, he rallied, made a violent effort to restrain himself, and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance. certainly, he said, your receipt is money."
3782,125-121124-0065.flac," how so? the count has an unlimited credit upon me, a credit opened by thompson and french of rome. he came to demand five million at once, which i paid him with checks on the bank. my funds are deposited there, and you can understand."
3783,125-121124-0053.flac," while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair. yes, keep it. keep it."" monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket, with that indescribable expression which seemed to say, come reflect if you repent there is still time."
3784,125-121124-0087.flac," fool! then enclosing monte cristo's receipt in the little pocketbook he added. yes, come at 12 o'clock, i shall then be far away. then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected about 50,000 francs in banknotes."
3785,125-121124-0014.flac," less owing to his social position than to his personal merit. the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves."
3786,125-121124-0028.flac," but we all have our faults. do you know count that persons of our time of life, not that you belong to the class, you are still a young man? but as i was saying, persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year."
3787,125-121124-0081.flac," ah, you're laughing at me. send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank shall be notified. i will come myself. better still, since i will afford me the pleasure of seeing you. they shook hands."
3788,125-121124-0082.flac," no, said the banker. i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto, so i remain in the background. baw, you are wrong. how are you to blame in that affair?"
3789,125-121124-0039.flac," there was a moment's silence during which the noise of the banker's pen was alone heard, while monte cristo examined the guilt molding on the ceiling. are they spanish, haitian?"
3790,125-121124-0012.flac, and some of our old friends made their appearance. we mean de bruit.
3791,125-121124-0042.flac," to the governor of the bank. please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my account. baron dong lars."
3792,125-121124-0030.flac," and then myself covered with ridicule through the villainy of benedetto besides. besides what, as the count? alas, do you not know? what new calamity? my daughter."
3793,125-121124-0068.flac, 5 million? here is his receipt. believe your own eyes.
3794,125-121124-0029.flac," for example, look at the puritanical procurer, who has just lost his daughter, and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner. myself dishonored and dead."
3795,125-121124-0064.flac," you did see him, i think? yes, well."
3796,125-121124-0031.flac," o'genee has left us. good heavens, what are you telling me?"" the truth, mind your count. oh, how happy you must be in not having either wife or children. do you think so? indeed i do."
3797,125-121124-0088.flac," burned several papers, left others exposed to view."
3798,125-121124-0079.flac," certainly, it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs. the receiver started back. ma foie, he said. i prefer waiting till tomorrow, what a proposition."""
3799,125-121124-0052.flac," oh dear, yes, and if you were at rome, the house of thompson and french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done. parted me, count, pardon me. then i may keep this money. yes, so don't go large."
3800,125-121124-0036.flac," as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously. yes, he answered. if a fortune brings consolation, i ought to be consoled. i am rich."""
3801,125-121124-0037.flac," if you wished to demolish them, you could not, and if it were possible, you would not dare."
3802,125-121124-0017.flac," so young, so rich, so beautiful, could you have imagined the scene chattoruno when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract? indeed no, said chattoruno, did you know her?"
3803,125-121124-0013.flac, accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army.
3804,125-121124-0086.flac, with an energy of action those can alone understand.
3805,125-121124-0033.flac," no, with a relation, but still we have quite lost our dear eugenie, for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france. still baron said monte cristo."
3806,125-121124-0021.flac," he would have interested himself somewhat more about it. still, such a torono."
3807,125-121124-0055.flac," as if one crown were not as good as another. excuse me, and he began to laugh loudly but nervously. certainly, i excuse you, said monte cristo graciously, and pocket them. and he placed the bonds in his pocketbook."
3808,125-121124-0016.flac," one of them was made of debray, château renaud, and bochant. poor girl said debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event. poor girl."
3809,125-121124-0025.flac," an advance to meet him with a sad, though affable smile. well, said he, extending his hand to monte cristo."
3810,125-121124-0035.flac," that money mitigates many trials. and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign bomb, you ought to be very easily consoled. you, the king of finance, the focus of immeasurable power."
3811,125-121124-0084.flac, they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain.
3812,125-121124-0070.flac," he has three unlimited credits, one on me, one on rothschild, one on lafitte, and you see, he added carelessly. he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100,000 francs."
3813,125-121124-0085.flac, after expressing a cute sympathy with the father.
3814,125-121124-0076.flac," are you then pressed for this money? yes, for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow. tomorrow? why did you not tell me so before? why it is as good as a century? and what hour does the examination take place? at two o'clock?"
3815,125-121124-0010.flac," and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be required. at twelve o'clock the morning coaches rolled into the paved court,"
3816,125-121124-0045.flac," no, sin monte cristo folding the five notes. most decidedly not. the thing is so curious. i will make the experiment myself. i'm credited on you for six million. i've drawn 900,000 francs."
3817,125-121124-0083.flac," listen, when one bears an irreproachable name as i do, one is rather sensitive."
3818,125-121124-0073.flac, for what reason? because they would not spend money so guiltfully acquired.
3819,125-121124-0069.flac," it is one of the best houses in europe said dunglar, carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk. and he had five million in your hands alone? why this count of monte cristo must be in a bob? indeed, i do not know what he is."
3820,125-121124-0071.flac," i must visit him, he said, and obtain some pious grudge from him. oh, you may make sure of him. his charity's alone amount to twenty thousand francs a month. it is magnificent."
3821,125-121124-0048.flac," if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker's feet,"
3822,125-121124-0015.flac," and who did not exact a mournful face or forced tears, as would have been the case with a father, a brother, or a lover."
3823,125-121124-0049.flac," what, he stammered. do you mean to keep that money? excuse me, excuse me, but i owe this money to the charity fund. a deposit which i promised to pay this morning. oh well then, sid monte cristo."
3824,125-121124-0006.flac," no, said villefort. only return again at eleven o'clock at twelve the oh heavens my poor, poor child, and the procurer again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned."
3825,125-121124-0050.flac," pay me in a different form. i wished from curiosity to take these, that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation, the house of dunglar had paid me five million without a minute's delay. it would have been remarkable. but here are your bonds. pay me differently."
3826,125-121124-0058.flac," i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures, or they would have been disputed with me."
3827,125-121124-0080.flac," that you had a deficiency to make up? indeed, to the receiver. and if that were the case, it would be worthwhile to make some sacrifice. thank you, no sir. then it will be tomorrow. yes, but without fail."
3828,125-121124-0024.flac," still, he ought to have been here,"" said debrae. i wonder what will be talked about tonight. this funeral is the news of the day, but hush. here comes our minister of justice."
3829,125-121124-0061.flac," we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips. good morning, creditor,"" said he, ""'for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me.'"""
3830,125-121124-0000.flac," donglar's signature. the next morning, dawned dull and cloudy. during the night, the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet."
3831,125-121124-0066.flac," that if i draw out ten million on the same day, it will appear rather strange to the governor. two days will be a different thing,"" said donglar, smiling. cum said bovill with a tone of entire incredulity. five million to that gentleman who just left."
3832,125-121124-0019.flac," the gentleman who receives us? is he a deputy? oh no, i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day, said boshal, but he is perfectly unknown to me. have you mentioned this death in your paper?"
3833,125-121124-0074.flac," upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army. while i must confess, these are scruples. i registered their deed of gift yesterday. and how much did they possess? oh, not much."
3834,125-121124-0041.flac," stay count, he added. you, who may be called the emperor, if i claim the title of king of finance, have you many pieces of paper of this size? each worth a million."
3835,125-121124-0054.flac," no, decidedly no. keep my signatures. but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business. i intended this money for the charity fund, and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds. how absurd."
3836,125-121124-0004.flac," grief does not stun me. i have not been in bed for two nights, but then look at my desk. see what i have written during these two days and nights. i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin, benedetto."
3837,125-121124-0005.flac," oh, work, work, my passion, my joy, my delight. it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows."
3838,125-121124-0027.flac," he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself. well on my word of honor i answered no. i wished no ill to mock self. he was a little proud perhaps for a man who, like myself, has risen from nothing."
3839,125-121124-0059.flac," who was standing in the waiting room, and who was introduced into donglar's room, as soon as the count had left. the count's sad face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand."
3840,125-121124-0034.flac," family griefs, or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure, are endureable to a millionaire. philosophers may well say, and practical men will always support the opinion"
3841,125-121124-0078.flac," take it to rothschild or lafitte's, and they will take it off your hands at once."
3842,125-121342-0032.flac, that's why a good man going wrong attracts people. they stand around and literally warm themselves at the calories of virtue he gives off. sarah makes an unsophisticated remark and the face simple and delight. how innocent the poor child is.
3843,125-121342-0000.flac," a fathom deepened sleep by lie, with old desires restrained before, to clamour lifeward with a cry, as dark flies out the grain-dour. and so in quest of creeds to share, i seek assertive day again."
3844,125-121342-0045.flac," want to go down there and see if it's dirty? french rivers all brown or black, so were southern rivers. $24 meant 480 donets. he could live on it three months in sleep in the park. wonder where jill was? jill bain, fain."
3845,125-121342-0019.flac," he thought cynically how completely he was lacking in all human sympathy. o henry had found in these people romance, paithas, love, hate, amory saw only coarseness, physical filth and stupidity. he made no self-accusations."
3846,125-121342-0012.flac," at best, just people, too hot or too cold, tired, worried. he pictured the rooms where these people lived, where the patterns of the blistered wall papers were heavy-reaturated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds."
3847,125-121342-0047.flac," on taste the best, isabel, clara, rosalind, eleanor were all american. eleanor would pitch probably south pa. rosalind was outfield, wonderful hitter. clara first base maybe."
3848,125-121342-0014.flac," living hard, brown deposits in the bull. it was not so bad where there were only men or else only women. it was when they were vitally hurtied that it all seemed so rotten. it was some shame that women gave off at having men see them tired and poor."
3849,125-121342-0042.flac," if it wasn't appendicitis, influenza may be. what? 120th street?"
3850,125-121342-0011.flac," the quarreless worry as to whether someone isn't leaning on you, a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman, hating her for it. the woman hating him for not doing it, at worse to squalid fantas' migoria of breath."
3851,125-121342-0008.flac," finally, the rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers were at work. new york seems not so much awakening as turning over in its bed. palette men rushed by pinching together their coat collars."
3852,125-121342-0027.flac," no, i am merely afraid of being poor. question. very afraid?"
3853,125-121342-0017.flac," how the smell of it had suddenly cleared the air and given everyone in the car a momentary glow. i detest poor people, thought amory, suddenly. i hate them for being poor. poverty may have been beautiful once, but it's rotten now."
3854,125-121342-0048.flac," wonder what humbird's body looks like now. if he himself hadn't been bayonet instructor, he'd have gone up to line three months sooner, probably been killed. where's the darned bell?"
3855,125-121342-0018.flac," and sang something to his companion with a look of utter disgust. probably thought amory what he said was, my god, aren't people horrible. never before in his life had amory considered poor people."
3856,125-121342-0024.flac, i can't imagine not being able to.
3857,125-121342-0016.flac," and danger. it was an atmosphere where in birth and marriage and death were loomsome, secret things. he remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers."
3858,125-121342-0001.flac," but old monotony is there, endless avenues of rain. oh, might i rise again, might i throw off the heat of that old wine, see the new morning mass the sky, with fairy towers line on line?"
3859,125-121342-0020.flac," never any more did he reproach himself for feelings that were natural and sincere. he accepted all his reactions as a part of him, unchangeable, unwarrior. this problem of poverty transformed, magnified, attached to some grander,"
3860,125-121342-0007.flac," that depressed him with its heavy odor, compounded of the tobacco smell of the men, and the fettid sensuousness of stale powder on women. after the thick crowd came another scattering, a stray half dozen, a man on crutches,"
3861,125-121342-0036.flac, not necessarily question. what would be the test of corruption?
3862,125-121342-0035.flac, i think so. i'm not sure. i'm not sure about good and evil at all anymore. question. is that a bad sign in itself?
3863,125-121342-0021.flac," more dignified attitude might someday even be his problem. at present, it roused only his profound estates. he walked over to fifth avenue dodging the blind black menace of umbrellas, and standing in front of del monaco's held and auto bus."
3864,125-121342-0031.flac," none. i've no more virtue to lose. just as a cooling pot gives off heat, so all through youth and adolescence we give off calories of virtue. that's what's called ingeniousness. question. an interesting idea."
3865,125-121342-0002.flac," the air became gray in opalescent, a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way, then another light, then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision. under his feet a thick iron-studded skylight turned yellow."
3866,125-121342-0040.flac," two and three look alike. no, not much. seat damp. our clothes absorbing wetness from seat or seat absorbing dryness from clothes. sitting on wet substance gave appendicitis so froggy parker's mother said. while he'd had it."
3867,125-121342-0030.flac," rather, i don't want to commit moral suicide. question. have you no interest left?"
3868,125-121342-0004.flac," the silence of the theater behind him ended with a curious snapping sound, followed by the heavy roaring of a rising crowd and the interlaced clatter of many voices. the matinee was over."
3869,125-121342-0044.flac," uncle had only paid 100 a month for a whole great big house in minneapolis, question, where the stairs on the left are right as you came in. anyway, in 12 univvy, they were straight back into the left. what a dirty river!"
3870,125-121342-0033.flac," they're warming themselves at her virtue, but sarah sees the simper and never makes that remark again, only she feels a little colder after that. question. all your calories gone?"
3871,125-121342-0043.flac," 102 instead of 127. rosalind not like beatrice. eleanor like beatrice only wilder and brainier. apartment's along here expensive, probably 150 a month, maybe 200."
3872,125-121342-0028.flac, just passively afraid. question.
3873,125-121342-0039.flac," this dialogue merged grotesquely into his mind's most familiar state, a grotesque blending of desires, worries, exterior impressions and physical reactions. 127th street, or 137th street."
3874,125-121342-0005.flac," he stood aside, edged a little into the rain to let the throng pass. a small boy rushed out, sniffed in the damp, fresh air, and turned up the collar of his coat. came three or four couples in a great hurry."
3875,125-121342-0003.flac," in the street, the lamps of the taxi cab sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement. the unwelcome november rain had perversely stolen the day's last hour, and pondered without ancient fence the night."
3876,125-121342-0013.flac," and always there was the economical stuffiness of indoor winter, and the long summers, nightmares of perspiration between sticky and developing walls. dirty restaurants where careless, tired people helped themselves to sugar with their own used coffee spoons."
3877,125-121342-0034.flac, all of them. i'm beginning to warm myself at other people's virtue. question. are you corrupt?
3878,125-121342-0026.flac," i don't know what i'll do, nor have i much curiosity. tomorrow i'm going to leave new york for good. it's a bad town unless you're on top of it. question, do you want a lot of money?"
3879,125-121342-0010.flac," and the numerous unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in threatening procession. there was the ghastly stinking crush of the subway. the car-cards thrusting themselves at one, leering out like dull-boars, who grab your arm with another story."
3880,125-121342-0038.flac, they don't. they just want the fun of eating it all over again. the matron doesn't want to repeat her girlhood. she wants to repeat her honeymoon.
3881,125-121342-0037.flac," becoming really insincere, calling myself not such a bad fellow, thinking i regretted my lost youth when i only envy the delights of losing it."
3882,125-121342-0046.flac, saying what the devil. neck hurts darned uncomfortable seat. no desire to sleep with jill. what could alex see in her?
3883,125-121342-0009.flac, a great swarm of tired magpie girls from a department store crowded along with shrieks of strident laughter. three to an umbrella. a squad of marching policemen passed already miraculously protected by oil skin capes. the rain gave a maria feeling of detachment.
3884,125-121342-0015.flac, it was some disgust that men had for women who were tired and poor. it was dirtier than any battlefield he had seen.
3885,125-121342-0029.flac, don't ask me. question. don't you care?
3886,125-121342-0023.flac, that i have about $24 to my name. question.
3887,125-121342-0025.flac," really, they are the only things i can do. question. be definite."
3888,125-121342-0006.flac," came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glance invariably, first at the wet street, then at the rain-filled air. finally at the dismal sky. last, a dense, strolling mass."
3889,125-121342-0041.flac," also, the steamboat company beatrice said, and my uncle has a quarter interest. did beatrice go to heaven? probably not. he represented beatrice's immortality. also, love affairs of numerous dead men who surely had never thought of him."
3890,125-121342-0022.flac," somewhere in his mind, a conversation began, rather resumed its place in his attention. it was composed not of two voices but of one which acted alike as questioner and answerer. question. well, what's the situation? answer."
3891,7059-77897-0027.flac," well, i must think about that, and i must ask mr. wilmington. jack, she called over her shoulder to the young man at the window. do you think your uncle would approve of me as juliet's nurse?"
3892,7059-77897-0009.flac," the lawn before it slipped down to the road, where it ended smoothly at the brink of a neat stone wall. a black asphalt path curved from the steps by which you mounted from the street, to the steps by which you mounted to the heavy portico."
3893,7059-77897-0006.flac," while a long freight train clattered deafeningly by, and then drove bumping and jouncing across the tracks. i suppose you remember what, over the track means in hatboro. oh yes, said annie with a smile. social perdition at the lease."
3894,7059-77897-0022.flac," but i don't know annie, whether i ought to remember my low beginnings. i suppose we all like to be consistent, answered annie aimlessly and easily. yes, mrs. munger broke in."
3895,7059-77897-0029.flac," she added, pulling out her watch by its leather guard. ""'not till you've had lunch,' said mrs. wilmington, rising with the ladies. ""'you must stay, and i shall not excuse you.'"" well?"
3896,7059-77897-0003.flac, i would rather not see mrs. wilmington with you on this subject. i should be of no use.
3897,7059-77897-0016.flac," yes, that's what anyone would think, in the abstract,"" said mrs. munger. now little boy."
3898,7059-77897-0030.flac," will you join us, jack?"" no, i'm going to the office,"" said the nephew, bowing himself out of the room. jack's london to be superintendent,"" said mrs. walmington, lifting her teasing voice to make him hear her in the hall."
3899,7059-77897-0024.flac," very well then, explain mrs. munger, will drop them. as i said to miss kilburn on our way here, if mrs. wilmington is opposed to them, we'll drop them. oh, am i such a..."
3900,7059-77897-0005.flac, cowed and troubled by the affair. that doesn't make the slightest difference that mrs. munger impartially. all you will have to do is to keep still. i will put the case to her. she checked the pony before the bar which the flagman at the railroad crossing had let down.
3901,7059-77897-0010.flac," before the massive black walnut doors. the ladies were shown into the music room, from which the notes of a piano were sounding when they rang, and mrs. walmington rose from the instrument to meet them, a young man who had been standing beside her turned away."
3902,7059-77897-0002.flac," it throws a new light on it, and if that's the way nice people are going to look at it, why we must give up the idea. i'm quite prepared to do so, but i want to see mrs. wilmington first. mrs. munger said annie uneasily."
3903,7059-77897-0018.flac," i used to be one of the hands myself. yes, annie, there was a time after you went away, and after father died, when i actually fell so low as to work for an honest living. i think i heard, lara,"" said annie."
3904,7059-77897-0011.flac," mrs. wilmington was dressed in a light morning dress, with a wateau fall, whose delicate dress its infated reds and yellows, heightened the richness of her complexion and hair. why, annie, she said, how glad i am to see you!"
3905,7059-77897-0012.flac," and you too, mrs. munger, how very nice! her words took value from the thick mellow tones of her voice, and passed for much more than they were worth intrinsically."
3906,7059-77897-0020.flac," and there's no use trying to deny it. as mr. putney says, he and i have our record, and we don't have to make any pretenses. and the question is, whether i ought to go back on my fellow hands. oh!"
3907,7059-77897-0001.flac," and that is the reason i spoke to him. but i met the other gentleman. you saw how they took it. i saw that they both made fun of it, said annie. yes, that's just the point."
3908,7059-77897-0019.flac," but i had forgotten. the fact, in connection with what had been said, made her still more uncomfortable. well, i didn't work very hard, and i didn't have to work long. but i was a hand."
3909,7059-77897-0017.flac, putting out a silencing hand in the direction of the young man. don't you be so fast? you let your auntie speak for herself. i don't know about not letting the hand stay to the dance and supper mrs. munger. you know i might feel put upon.
3910,7059-77897-0007.flac," yes, it isn't so bad as it used to be socially. mr. wilmington has built a very fine house on this side, and there are several pretty queen and cottages going up. they drove along under the elms, which here stood somewhat at random about the wide grass of street."
3911,7059-77897-0000.flac," oh, no, i don't care anything about him,"" said mrs. munger, touching her pony with the tip of her quip lash. he's an odious little creature, and i knew that he would go for the dance and supper, because mr. peck was opposed to them. he's one of the anti-peck party in his church."
3912,7059-77897-0025.flac," an influential person said mrs. wilmington with a shrug. it's rather awful, isn't it annie? not at all, mrs. munker answered for annie. we've just been talking the matter over with mr. putney and dr. morrell."
3913,7059-77897-0031.flac," and he's been spent in the whole morning here. in the richly-pointed dining room, a glitter of china and glass and a mass of carbon oak. the table was laid for two. put another plate, nora."
3914,7059-77897-0008.flac," between the high-windowy bulks of the shoe shops and hatch shops. the desk gradually freed itself from the cinders about the tracks, and it hardened into a handsome newly made road beyond the houses of the shop-hands."
3915,7059-77897-0014.flac," mr. wilmington and mrs. munger are old friends. the young fellow bowed silently, and annie instantly took a dislike to him. his heavy jaw, long eyes, and low forehead almost hidden under a thick bang. he sat down corner-wise on a chair."
3916,7059-77897-0021.flac," but mrs. wilmington said mrs. munger, with intense deprecation, that's such a very different thing. you were not brought up to it. it was just temporary. and besides—and besides—"
3917,7059-77897-0013.flac," we had the furnace slided yesterday, and we'd been in all the morning, and so we hadn't noticed. jack, won't you shut the register she'd drawn over her shoulder? this is my nephew, mr. jack wilmington miss kilburn."
3918,7059-77897-0032.flac, said mrs. wilmington carelessly.
3919,7059-77897-0015.flac," and having previously committed mrs. wilmington in favor of the general scheme, asked her what she thought of that part. mr. jack wilmington answered for her. i should thank you had a right to do what you please about it. it's none of the hands business if you don't choose to ask them."
3920,7059-77897-0028.flac," you'd better ask him, girl, the young fellow. oh, well, said mrs. wilmton with another lap. i'll thank you over mrs. munger. thank you, said mrs. munger, and now we must really be going."
3921,7059-77897-0026.flac," and they're both opposed. you're merely the straw that breaks the camel's back, mrs. wilmington. oh, thank you! that's a great relief!"
3922,7059-77897-0004.flac," and she laid her arm across annie's lap, as if to prevent her jumping out of the faten. as mrs. walmington's old friend, you will have the greatest influence with her. but i don't know that i wish to influence her in favor of the supper and dance. i don't know that i believe in them,"" said annie."
3923,7059-77897-0023.flac," but i guess i must suppose the little invited dance and supper on principle. we all like to be consistent, as annie says, even if we're inconsistent in the attempt, she added with a laugh."
3924,7059-77900-0018.flac," with the habit he had of touching it there, with the tip of his tongue, made any think of a cat that had been at the cream. i've been hoping to call with mrs. wilmington to pay my respects, but i've been away a great deal this season, and—and—"
3925,7059-77900-0028.flac," it was a relief to get away from it, all into the room, cool and quiet, where half a dozen neat girls were counting and stamping the stockings with different numbers. here's where i used to woe, sid lyra."
3926,7059-77900-0030.flac," i don't. well, they're not dreams exactly annie, when all sit and done for them. when they left the mill she asked annie to come home to tea with her, saying,"
3927,7059-77900-0031.flac," as if from a perception of her dislike for the young fellow, the jack was going to boston. they had a long evening together, after mr. wilmington took himself off after tea to his study, as he called it,"
3928,7059-77900-0024.flac," the tireless machines marched back and forth across the floor, and the men who watched them with suicidal intensity ran after them barefooted when they made off with a broken thread, spliced it, and then escaped from them to their stations again."
3929,7059-77900-0025.flac, they looked after lyro and her nephew from under cotton frow's bangs. they all seemed to know her and returned her easy kindly greetings with an effect of liking.
3930,7059-77900-0006.flac," i've just got my new fayton, and i drove up at once to crush you with it. isn't it a beauty? you're too late, lyra,"" said annie. i've just come from the northwicks, and another crushing beauty has got in ahead of your fayton."
3931,7059-77900-0009.flac," i want you to take a drive with me in trauma and you've fated."" said lyra coming out. annie now looked at it with that irresolution of hers, and lyra commanded, get right in."
3932,7059-77900-0027.flac, except when jack wilmington curtly ordered them to do this or that in illustration of some point he was explaining. she worried herself as people do in such places and expressing her wonder at the ingenuity of the machinery.
3933,7059-77900-0021.flac," i'll go with you with great pleasure. ah! he bustled about putting the things together on his table, and then reaching for the panama hat on a hook behind it. there was something pathetic in his eagerness to do what lyra bade him."
3934,7059-77900-0001.flac," which her physical delicacy awakened. she asked her how she ever came to take up the social union, and answered for her that, of course, it had the attraction of the theatricals. and went on to talk of her sister's part in them."
3935,7059-77900-0036.flac," she said she studied music a little and confessed that she read a good deal. novels mostly, though the library was handsomely equipped with well-bound general literature. at moments it all seemed no harm."
3936,7059-77900-0007.flac," oh, poor annie! lyra began to laugh with agreeable intelligence. do come in and tell me about it. why is that girl going to take part in the theatricals? she doesn't care to please anyone, does she?"
3937,7059-77900-0008.flac," do you mean it, lyra, demanded annie, arrested on her threshold by the charm of this improbability? well, i don't know. they're opposites. but upon second thoughts, you needn't come in, annie."
3938,7059-77900-0040.flac," oh, then, said annie, perhaps he accounts for her plane juliet."
3939,7059-77900-0017.flac," where her husband sat writing at a table. george, i want to introduce you to miss kilburn."
3940,7059-77900-0032.flac," and remained shut in there. annie was uneasily aware of him from time to time, but lyra had apparently no more disturbance from his absence than from his presence, which he had managed with a frank acceptance of everything it suggested."
3941,7059-77900-0005.flac," mrs. wilmington put her head out of the open parlour window. how'd you do, annie? she drooled in her tender voice. won't you come in? you see, i'm in possession."
3942,7059-77900-0012.flac," we'll just go around there and kill two birds with one stone. i'll to show off my new fate and to mr. wilmington, first of all, he gave it to me. it would be kind of conjugal or filial or something."
3943,7059-77900-0039.flac, ought to be tacit or explicit in the kissing and embrace between romeo and juliet.
3944,7059-77900-0013.flac," you know mr. wilmington and i are not exactly contemporaries, annie. i heard he was somewhat your senior,"" said annie, reluctantly. lyra left."
3945,7059-77900-0016.flac, and finding its first apartment empty.
3946,7059-77900-0010.flac," we'll go down to the works. you've never met my husband yet, have you, annie?"" no, i haven't, lyra. i've always just missed him somehow. he seems to have been perpetually just gone to town, or not got back. well,"
3947,7059-77900-0029.flac," and he is where i first met mr. wilmington. the place is full of romantic associations. the stuckins are all one size, annie."
3948,7059-77900-0000.flac," miss northwick called upon annie during the week, with excuses for her delay and for coming alone. she seemed to have intentions of being polite, but she constantly portrayed her want of interest in annie, and disappointed in the expectation of refinement."
3949,7059-77900-0034.flac," annie said she thought she would at least like to go to the seaside somewhere during the summer. but no, laira said. it would be too much trouble, and you know annie. i always did hate trouble."
3950,7059-77900-0042.flac," annie lay awake a long time that night. she was sure that she ought not to like lyra if she did not approve of her, and that she ought not to have gone home to tea with her and spent the evening with her unless she fully respected her."
3951,7059-77900-0026.flac," from time to time, at lyra's bidding, the young fellow explained to annie some curious feature of the processes."
3952,7059-77900-0011.flac," he's really at home now, and i don't mean at the house, which isn't home to him, but the works. you've never seen the works either, have you? no, i haven't. well then."
3953,7059-77900-0041.flac," oh, it's at the rehearsals you know that the fun is."
3954,7059-77900-0019.flac," we're all very happy to have you home again, miss kilburn. i've often heard my wife speak of your old days together at hatboro. they fence with some polite fence of interest in each other. the old man standing beside his writing table."
3955,7059-77900-0038.flac," with the superfluity which it involved no self-denial to give from. but mr. peck had given her a point of view, and though she believed she did not agree with him, she could not escape from it."
3956,7059-77900-0023.flac," and the first room was like what annie had seen before in cotton factories, with a faint smell of oil from the machinery and a fine snow of fluff in the air, and catching to the white washed walls and the foul window sashes."
3957,7059-77900-0003.flac," she met the younger sister whom she found a great beauty. she seemed very cold, and of a hot tear which she subdued with difficulty, but she was more consecutively polite than her sister, and annie watched with fascination her turns at the head."
3958,7059-77900-0022.flac," i'll show them through,"" he said to his uncle, and the old man ascended with. well, perhaps you'd better jack, and went back to his room. the wilmington stocking mill spun their own threads."
3959,7059-77900-0037.flac," at others the luxury in which this life was so contentedly sunk, oppressed annie like a thick, close heir. yet she knew that lyra was kind to many of the poor people about her, and did a great deal of good, as the phrase is."
3960,7059-77900-0020.flac," and stained himself with a shaking hand upon it. lyra interrupted them. well, i think now that annie is here, we'd better not let her get away without showing her the works. oh, oh decidedly!"
3961,7059-77900-0004.flac," her movements of leopard swiftness and elasticity, the changing lights of her complexion, the curb of her fine lips, the fluttering of her thin nostrils. a very new basket-faton stood glittering at annie's door when she got home."
3962,7059-77900-0014.flac," they came round into the region of the shops and lyra checked her pony in front of her husband's factory. it was not imposingly large, but as mrs. wilmington caused annie to observe, it was as big as the hatt shops and as ugly as the shoe shops."
3963,7059-77900-0015.flac," the structure trembled with the operation of its industry, and as they mounted the wooden steps to the open outside door, an inner door swung a jar for a moment, and let out a roar mingled with a hum and whorel."
3964,7059-77900-0033.flac," she talked freely of her marriage, not to siphon it were like others, but for what it was. she showed annie over the house, and she ended with a display of the rich dresses, which she was always buying her, and which she never wore, because she never went anywhere."
3965,7059-77900-0035.flac," and i don't want to be poked into a hotel, so i stay in hatboro. she said that she had always been a village girl and did not miss the interests of a larger life as she cut glimpses of them in south hatboro or want the bother of them."
3966,7059-77900-0002.flac," the relation of the northwick family to the coming entertainment, and an impression of frail modeled wrists and high-thin cheeks, and an absence of modeling under a fluent drapery, was the main effect of miss northwick's visit. when annie returned it, she was a great woman."
3967,7059-88364-0030.flac," grow up models for all the world of plant arrangement and tree luxury. our mechanical east is approved, our tension is relaxed, our ugliness is challenged every time we look upon those garden paths and for us."
3968,7059-88364-0012.flac," yet there is a difference. the present day man in the street, man about town, californian, has an obvious magnificence about him that is allied to the eucalyptus tree. the pomegranate. california is a gilded state."
3969,7059-88364-0005.flac, already the california sort in the commercial channels has become the broadly accepted if mediocre national form. people who revered the pilgrim fathers of 1620
3970,7059-88364-0031.flac, it is possible for los angeles to lay hold of the motion picture as our national textbook in art as boston appropriated to herself the guardianship of the national textbooks of literature.
3971,7059-88364-0018.flac," part of the thinness of california is not only its youth, but the result of the physical fact that the human race is there spread over so many acres of land. they try not only to count their minds and enumerate their palm trees."
3972,7059-88364-0025.flac," through all four seasons. very beauty overwhelms the lumbering grandstand players. the tiniest garden is a jewel pathway of wonder, but the californian cannot shout,"
3973,7059-88364-0022.flac," they will be a different set of virtues from those of new england. there is no more natural place for the scattering of confetti than this state, except the moving picturesque itself. both have a genius for gardens and dancing and carnival."
3974,7059-88364-0020.flac, they shout their statistics across the rockies and the deserts to new york. the mississippi valley is non-existent to the california. his fellow feeling is for the opposite coastline.
3975,7059-88364-0006.flac," have often wished those gentlemen had more their bark in the region of los angeles, rather than pumat-rok, that boston had been founded there, at last that landing is achieved."
3976,7059-88364-0017.flac, as the shadow it throws upon the screen. this new-ness california has in common with all photo-plays. it is thrillingly possible for the state and the art to acquire spiritual tradition and depth together.
3977,7059-88364-0007.flac," patriotic art students have discussed with mingold irony and admiration the boston domination of the only american culture of the 19th century, namely literature. indianapolis has had her day since then."
3978,7059-88364-0009.flac," but are also grounded in the honest hope of a healthy rivalry. they want new romanticists and artists, as indigenous to their soil, as was hawthorne to which haunted salem or longfellow to the chestnuts of his native heath."
3979,7059-88364-0001.flac," with much slap you on the back, personal gossip. this is the outgrowth of the fact that every type of the photo play, but the intimate, is founded on some phase of the out of doors. being thus dependent,"
3980,7059-88364-0033.flac," the dean of american singers, clark ashton smith, the young star-treter, george sterling, that son of ancient merlin, having their songs the seeds of better scenarios than california has sent us."
3981,7059-88364-0004.flac," as they should be, california indeed stands a chance to achieve through the films and utterance of her own. will this land further swest? be the first to capture the inner spirit of this newest and most curious of the arts?"
3982,7059-88364-0008.flac," chicago is lifting her head. nevertheless, boston still controls the textbook in english and dominates our high schools. ironic feelings in this matter on the part of western men are based somewhat on envy and illegitimate cussedness."
3983,7059-88364-0026.flac," orange blossoms, orange blossoms, heliotrop, heliotrop. he cannot boom forth rose leaves, rose leaves, so that he does their beauty's justice."
3984,7059-88364-0010.flac," whatever may be said of the patriarchs from oliver wendell holmes to amos branson alcott, they were true sons of the new england stone fences and meeting houses. they could not have been born or nurtured anywhere else on the face of the earth."
3985,7059-88364-0034.flac, there are two poems by george sterling that i have had in mind for many a day as conceptions that should inspire mystic films akin to them. these poems are the night centuries and the night centuries.
3986,7059-88364-0029.flac," than the aisles of the romanesque, namely the groves of the giant redwoods. the campaign for a beautiful nation could very well emanate from the west coast, where with the slightest care"
3987,7059-88364-0014.flac, the hue of the golden gate that opens the sunset way to mystic and terrible cafe and hindu stand. the enemy of california says the state is magnificent but thin.
3988,7059-88364-0023.flac," when the californian relegates the dramatic to secondary scenes, both in his life and his photo play, and turns to the genuinely epic and lyric,"
3989,7059-88364-0000.flac," around los angeles, the greatest and most characteristic moving picture colonies are being built. each photoplay magazine has its california letter, telling of the putting up of new studios and the transfer of actors."
3990,7059-88364-0024.flac, he and this instrument may find their immortality together as new england found its soul in the essays of emerson.
3991,7059-88364-0028.flac, the california photo playwright can base his crowd picture upon the city worshipping mobs of san francisco. he can arrive his patriotic and religious splendors from something older and more magnificent.
3992,7059-88364-0016.flac," he says the citizens of this state lack the richness of an aesthetic and religious tradition. he says there is no substitute for time, but even these things make for coincidence."
3993,7059-88364-0027.flac," here is where the photo play can begin to give him a more delicate utterance, and he can go on into stranger things and evolve all the splendor films into higher types. for the very name of california is splendor."
3994,7059-88364-0003.flac," but for a description of california, ask any traveler or study the background of almost any photo play. if the photo play is the consistent utterance of its scenes, if the actors are incarnations of the land they walk upon,"
3995,7059-88364-0019.flac," but they count the miles of their sea-coast, and the acres under cultivation and the height of the peaks, and revel in large statistics and the bigness generally, and forget how a few men rattle around in a great deal of scenery."
3996,7059-88364-0011.flac, some of us view with the peculiar thrill the prospect that los angeles may become the boston of the photo play. perhaps it would be better to say the florence because california reminds one.
3997,7059-88364-0015.flac," he declares it is as though it were painted on a robbed and negian piece of gilt paper, and he who dampens his finger and thrusts it through finds an alkylye valley on the other side, the lonely prickly pair, and a heap of ashes from a deserted campfire."
3998,7059-88364-0013.flac," it has not the sordidness of gold as has wall street, but it is the embodiment of the natural ore that the ragged prospector finds. the gold of california is the color of the orange, the glitter of dawn in the yosemite."
3999,7059-88364-0021.flac," through the geographical accident of separation by mountain and desert from the rest of the country, he becomes a mere shouder, harrying so assiduously that all variety in the voice is lost."
4000,7059-88364-0032.flac," if california has a shining soul and not merely a golden body, let her forget her 17-year-old melodramatic and turn her poets who understand the heart underneath the glory. edwin markham"
4001,7059-88364-0002.flac," the plant can best be set up where there is no winter. besides this, the los angeles region has the sea, the mountains, the desert, and many kinds of grove and field. landscape and architecture are subtropical."
4002,1737-142396-0011.flac," i trust he is a bishop by this time. he had all the necessary qualifications as we knew. these strange folk had visitors sometimes. stiff and colorless olympians like themselves, equally without vital interest in intelligent pursuits."
4003,1737-142396-0003.flac, they were freed to issue forth and by gunpowder in the full eye of the sun. free to fire cannons and explode mines on the lawn. yet they never did any one of these things. no irresistible energy hailed them to church as sundays.
4004,1737-142396-0020.flac," but was the matter allowed to end there? i tro not. again, when harold was locked up in his room all day for a salt and battery upon a neighbor's pig, an action he would have scorned, being indeed on the friendliest terms with the porker in question."
4005,1737-142396-0009.flac," he neither laughed nor sneered as the olympians would have done. but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy, he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion"
4006,1737-142396-0006.flac," a place, elf haunted, wonderful. simply produce so many apples and cherries. or it didn't when the failures of nature were not infrequently ascribed to us."
4007,1737-142396-0018.flac, than the kindly beasts who shared our natural existence in the sun. the astrangement was fortified by an abiding sense of injustice.
4008,1737-142396-0023.flac," a saddening doubt, a dull suspicion creeps over me. at an arcadia ego."
4009,1737-142396-0022.flac," well, the olympians are all past and gone. somehow the sun does not seem to shine so brightly as it used. the trackless meadows of old time have shrunken dwindled away to a few poor acres."
4010,1737-142396-0016.flac," under the delusion that these pale, phantasm's of reality were among the importance of life. we illuminati, eating silently, our heads full of plans and conspiracies could have told them what real life was."
4011,1737-142396-0004.flac," yet they went there regularly of their own accord, that they betrayed no greater delight in the experience than ourselves. on the whole the existence of these olympians seemed to be entirely void of interests."
4012,1737-142396-0002.flac," but only a certain blend of envy of their good luck and pity for their inability to make use of it. indeed, it was one of the most hopeless features in their character when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them, which wasn't often."
4013,1737-142396-0019.flac," or admit themselves in the wrong, or to accept similar concessions on our part. for instance, when i flung the cat out of an upper window, though i did it from no ill feeling, and it didn't hurt the cat,"
4014,1737-142396-0021.flac," there was no handsome expression of regret on the discovery of the real culprit. what harold had felt was not so much the imprisonment. indeed, he had very soon escaped by the window with assistance from his allies and had only gone back in time for his release as the olympian happet."
4015,1737-142396-0010.flac," then too, he was always ready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding indians on the shortest possible notice. in brief, a distinctly able man with talents so far as we could judge immensely above the majority."
4016,1737-142396-0017.flac," we had just left it outside, and we're all on fire to get back to it. of course, we didn't waste the revelation on them, the futility of imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated. one in thought and purpose, linked by the necessity of combating one hostile fate,"
4017,1737-142396-0013.flac," silently submitting as was our want with more contempt than anger. anon with anxious hair and faces stiffened in a conventional grin,"
4018,1737-142396-0012.flac," emerging out of the clouds and passing away again to drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our kin, then brute force was pitilessly applied. we were captured, washed, and forced into clean collars."
4019,1737-142396-0008.flac," there was an exception in the curate, who would receive unblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo, which it was our delight, moccasin and tomahawked, to ride down with those whoops that announced the senting of blood."
4020,1737-142396-0000.flac," i can see now that to children with a proper equipment of parents, these things would have worn a different aspect. but to those whose nearest were aunts and uncles, a special attitude of mine may be allowed. they treated us, indeed, with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh."
4021,1737-142396-0007.flac," though the whole place swarmed with such portans. they cared not about exploring for robbers' caves, nor digging for hidden treasure. perhaps indeed it was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of their time, stuffily indoors."
4022,1737-142396-0014.flac, how could reasonable people spend their precious time so?
4023,1737-142396-0015.flac," or to hunt bears among the hazels. it was incessant matter for amazement how these olympians would talk over our heads during meals, for instance, of this or the other social or political amenity."
4024,1737-142396-0005.flac, even as their movements were confined in slow and their habits stereotyped and senseless. to anything but appearances they were blind.
4025,1737-142396-0001.flac," while their grew up in me as in the parallel case of caliban upon setabos, a vague sense of a ruling power willful and freakish, and prone to the practice of vagaries, just choosing so."

4044,1737-142397-0020.flac," i ran sideways shouting, i dug glad heels into the squalching soil. i splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick. i hurled clawed skywards at random, and presently i somehow found myself singing."
4045,1737-142397-0037.flac," i seemed to discern faintly a something of the stern meaning in her valorous chant. my invisible companion was singing also and seemed at times to be chuckling softly to himself, doubtless, at thought of the strange new lessons he was teaching me."
4046,1737-142397-0029.flac," and presently i came within the village church, sitting solitary within its circle of elms. from fourth the vestry window projected two small legs, gyrating, hungry for foothold, with larceny."
4047,1737-142397-0023.flac," a belated truant you have dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale, expressionless moon for company. today, why not i, the trickster, the hypocrite? i, who whip round corners and bluster, relapse and evade, then rally and pursue."
4048,1737-142397-0016.flac," at each step growing less charlotte, the mummer of a minute, and more the anxious pilgrim of all time. the lion's wrath waxed terrible at her approach, his roaring filled the startled air."
4049,1737-142397-0006.flac," always duck staunchly to a new fad till he had worn it quite out. just at present, he was a muffin man."
4050,1737-142397-0008.flac," to pass along busy streets of your own building, forever ringing an imaginary bell, and offering airy muffins of your own make to a bustling, thronging crowd of your own creation. there were points about the game, it cannot be denied, though it seems, scarce and harmony with this radiant windswept warning."
4051,1737-142397-0005.flac," oh, he's just playing muffin man as usual, and charlotte, with patchlands, fancy wanting to be a muffin man on a whole holiday. it was a strange craze, certainly, but herald, who invented his own games and played them without assistance."
4052,1737-142397-0038.flac," perhaps two at a special bit of waggishness he had still in store. for when at last he grew weary of such insignificant earthbound company, he deserted me in a certain spot i knew, then dropped, subsided, and slunk away into nothingness."

4308,4406-16882-0050.flac," she would be often asking the indians to let her go home. they not being willing to that, and yet vexed with her opportunity. gathered a great company together about her and stripped her naked and set her in the midst of them. and when they had sung and danced about her in their hellish manner,"
4309,4406-16882-0034.flac," god, having taken away this dear child, i went to see my daughter mary, who was at this same indian town at a wigwam not very far off."
4310,4406-16882-0000.flac," belonging to our garrison, but none of them would stir. though another time, if any indian had come to the door, they were ready to fly upon him and tear him down. the lord hereby would make those the more acknowledged as hand, and to see that our help is always in him."
4311,4406-16882-0001.flac," but out we must go, the fire increasing and coming along behind us roaring, and the indians gaping before us with their guns, spears and hats it stood of our res."
4312,4406-16882-0010.flac," i should choose rather to be killed by them than take and alive. but when it came to the trial, my mind changed. their glittering weapons so daunted my spirit. that i chose rather to go along with those, as i may say. rabbinus peace."
4313,4406-16882-0035.flac, she was about ten years old and taken from the door at first by a praying indian and afterwards sold for a gun.
4314,4406-16882-0013.flac," i asked them whether i might not lodge in the house that night, to which they answered. what? will you love english men still? this was the dolefulest night that ever my eyes saw, all the roaring and singing and dancing and yelling of those black creatures in the night."
4315,4406-16882-0044.flac," and turn all those curses upon our enemies. i do not desire to live to forget this scripture, and what comfort it was to me. now."
4316,4406-16882-0042.flac," and every time that the other went over their number, these at home gave a shout, that the very earth rung again. and thus they continued till those that had been upon the expedition would come up to the sagamor's wigwam, and then..."
4317,4406-16882-0003.flac," through the bowels in hand of my dear child in my arms. one of my elder sister's children, named william, had then his leg broken, which the indians perceiving they knocked him on his head."
4318,4406-16882-0026.flac," one of the indians got up upon a horse, and they set me up behind him with my poor sick babe in my lap, a very weird sum and tedious day i had of it. what with my own wound and my child being so exceedingly sick and in a lamentable condition with her wound?"
4319,4406-16882-0033.flac, and there they told me they had buried it.
4320,4406-16882-0027.flac, this day in the afternoon about an hour by sun.
4321,4406-16882-0049.flac," we have good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart. wait, i say, on the lord. the fourth remove, and now i must part with that little company i had."
4322,4406-16882-0025.flac, and we were both alive to see the light of the next morning. the third we move.
4323,4406-16882-0004.flac," standing amazed with the blood running down to our heels, my eldest sister being yet in the house and seeing those wolf-ful-sites, the infidel's hauling mother's one way and children another, and some wallowing in their blood."
4324,4406-16882-0047.flac," i wish or not to run away by any means, for we were near 30 miles from any english town."
4325,4406-16882-0005.flac," and her elder son, telling her that her son william was dead, and myself was wounded, she said, and lord let me die with them, which was no sooner said but she was struck with a bullet, and fell down dead over the threshold."
4326,4406-16882-0039.flac," and told me he had seen his sister mary and prayed me that i would not be troubled in reference to himself. the occasion of his coming to see me at this time was this. there was, as i said, about six miles from us a small plantation of indians, where it seems he had been during his captivity."
4327,4406-16882-0041.flac," by their noise and hoopingly signified how many they had destroyed, which was at that time 23."
4328,4406-16882-0016.flac," my children gone, my relations and friends gone, are house and home and all are comforts within door and without all was gone, except my life. and i knew not but the next moment that might go to, there remain nothing to me but one poor wounded baby."
4329,4406-16882-0020.flac," that it did not quite fail. one of the indians carried my poor wounded babe upon a horse. it went moaning all along, i shall die, i shall die. i went on foot after it, with sorrow that cannot be expressed. at length i took it off the horse."
4330,4406-16882-0015.flac," and the dismalness of the present night. my thoughts ran upon my losses and sad-be-reaved condition all was gone. my husband gone. at least separated from me, he being in the bay, and to add to my grief the indians told me they would kill him as he came homeward."
4331,4406-16882-0011.flac," then that moment to end my days, and that i made the better declare what happened to me during the previous captivity, i shall particularly speak of the several moves we had up and down in the wilderness. the first remove, now away we must go with those barbarous creatures."
4332,4406-16882-0006.flac," i hope she is reaping the fruit of her good labor, being faithful to the service of god in her place. in her younger years, she lay under much trouble upon spiritual accounts. tell it please, god, to make that precious scripture take hold of her heart. and he said unto me,"
4333,4406-16882-0008.flac, and relations lie bleeding out their heart blood upon the ground. there was one who was chopped into the head with a hatchet and stripped naked.
4334,4406-16882-0017.flac," and it seemed that present worse than death that it was in such a pitiful condition, be speaking compassion. and i had no refreshing for it, nor suitable things to revive it. little do many think what is the savageness and brutishness of this barbarous enemy."
4335,4406-16883-0058.flac," were going to the french reporter. but by the way, the mohawks met with them and killed four of their company, which made the rest turn back again for it might have been worse with him. had he been sold to the french?"
4336,4406-16883-0060.flac," he told me he was very sick of a flux, with eating so much blood. they had turned him out of the wigwam, and with him an indian papus almost dead whose parents have been killed."
4337,4406-16883-0043.flac," where we abode almost a fortnight, here one asked me to make a shirt for her purpose, for which she gave me a mess of broth, which was thickened with meal made of the bark of a tree, and to make it the better."
4338,4406-16883-0049.flac," but when i was without and saw nothing but wilderness and woods, and a company of barbarous heathens, my mind quickly returned to me, which made me think of that spoken concerning samson who said, i will go out and shake myself as at other times."
4339,4406-16883-0050.flac," but he whist, not that the lord was departed from him. about this time i began to think that all my hopes of restoration would come to nothing. i thought of the english army and hope for their coming and being taken by them, but that failed."
4340,4406-16883-0056.flac," and that all persuaded i was dead, so like were these barbarous creatures to him who was a liar from the beginning. as i was sitting once in the wigwam here, filmsmaid came in with the child in her arms."
4341,4406-16883-0052.flac," as my master spake, but instead of that, my master himself was gone and i left behind so that my spirit was now quite ready to sink. i asked them to let me go out and pick up some sticks, that i might get alone and pour out my heart onto the lord."
4342,4406-16883-0046.flac," as big as his two fingers, and that he was very good meat. but the lord upheld my spirit under this discouragement,"
4343,4406-16883-0044.flac, and a few roasted ground nuts. i had not seen my son a pretty while.
4344,4406-16883-0042.flac," but i had no other comforting answer from them than this, that it would be no matter if my head were off to. the 13th remove, instead of going toward the bay, which was what i desired,"
4345,4406-16883-0053.flac," they all gathered about the poor man, asking him many questions. i desired also to go and see him, but when i came he was crying bitterly, supposing they would quickly kill him. whereupon asked one of them whether they intended to kill him, he answered me, they would not."
4346,4406-16883-0045.flac, and asked him when he saw him. he answered me that such a time his master roasted him.
4347,4406-16883-0051.flac," i hoped to be carried to albany, as the indians had discourse before, but that failed also. i thought of being sold to my husband."
4348,4406-16883-0055.flac," that whatsoever the indians told me respecting him was vanity and lies. some of them told me he was dead, and they had killed him. some said he was married again and that the governor wished him to marry. and told him he should have his choice."
4349,4406-16883-0057.flac," i told her i would tear her coat then, with that my mistress rises up."
4350,4406-16883-0047.flac," that makes the least conscience of speaking the truth. in this place, on a cold night, as i lay by the fire, i remove the stick. i kept the heat from me."
4351,4406-16883-0054.flac," he, being a little cheered with that, i asked him about the welfare of my husband. he told me he saw him such a time in the bay, and he was well, but very melancholy, by which i certainly understood, though i suspected it before."
4352,4406-16883-0048.flac," i had a pond this and the like occasions, i hope it is not too much to say with job."
4353,4406-16883-0059.flac, then it proved to be in his remaining with the indians. i went to see an english youth in this place.
4354,4406-16883-0018.flac," i put it in my pocket to keep it safe, yet notwithstanding somebody stole it. we put five indian corns in the room of it, which corns were the greatest provisions i had in my travel for one day."
4355,4406-16883-0031.flac," and put it into my pocket, and never let her see it after. then they packed up their things to be gone, and gave me my load, i complained it was too heavy whereupon she gave me a slap in the face and bade me go."
4356,4406-16883-0030.flac," and gave me some groundnuts and bade me come again, and told me they would buy me if they were able. and yet these were strangers to me that i never saw before. the ten-threw move."
4357,4406-16883-0013.flac," afterwards, he asked me to make a cap for his boy, for which he invited me to dinner. i went, and he gave me a pancake, about as big as two fingers. it was made of parched wheat, beaten and fried in bears grease."
4358,4406-16883-0035.flac, be still and know that i am god. psalm 46.
4359,4406-16883-0037.flac," i told them i could not tell where to go if they made me go look. i told them if i went to another wigwam, they would be angry and send me home again, then one of the company drew his sword and told me he would run me through if i did not go presently. then…"
4360,4406-16883-0036.flac," which were some refreshing to me. towards night i gathered some sticks from my own comfort that i might not lie a cold. but when we came to lie down they baited me to go out and lie somewhere else. for they had company they said, come in more than their own."
4361,4406-16883-0021.flac," but he living by the riverside where it often went to fetch water, i would often be putting of him in mind. and calling for my pay, that last he told me if i would make another shirt for a papuznaet born he would give me a knife, which he did when i had done it."
4362,4406-16883-0039.flac," i went to one wigwam, and they told me they had no room. then i went to another, and they said the same. at last an old indian bade me to come to him, and his squaw gave me some ground nuts."
4363,4406-16883-0002.flac," even as the psalmist says to declare the works of the lord and his wonderful power in carrying us along, preserving us in the wilderness while under the enemy's hand and returning of us in safety again, and his goodness."
4364,4406-16883-0005.flac," which was the first time to my remembrance that i went before them. although i had met with so much affliction and my heart was many times ready to break, yet could i not shed one tear in their sight, but rather..."
4365,4406-16883-0023.flac, where they had stored up some in the ground.
4366,4406-16883-0014.flac," and bear together. and invited my master and mistress to dinner, but the proud gossip, because i served them both in one dish, would eat nothing, except one bit that he gave her upon the point of his knife."
4367,4406-16883-0009.flac," it seems to be a bait, the devil lays, to make men lose their precious time."
4368,4406-16883-0016.flac," i pray, god, he may remember these things now. he is returned in safety. at this place, the sun now getting higher, what with the beans and heat of the sun and the smoke of the wigwans, i thought i should have been blind."
4369,4406-16883-0010.flac," when i had taken two or three pipes, it was presently ready for another. such a bewitching thing it is. but i thank god he has now given me power over it surely there are many who..."
4370,4406-16883-0028.flac, for fear they would get it from me. and there it lay all that day and night in my stinking pocket.
4371,4406-16883-0029.flac, but now that was savory to me that one would think was enough to turn the stomach of a brute creature. one bitter cold day i could find no room to sit down before the fire.
4372,4406-16883-0000.flac," and the change that had come upon us, we had husband and father in children and sisters and friends and relations and house and home and many comforts of this life. but now we may say, as job,"
4373,4406-16883-0011.flac," whereupon they fell to boiling of ground nuts, and partying of corn and"
4374,4406-16883-0012.flac," during my abode in this place, philip spaked me, to make a shirt for his boy, which i did, for which he gave me a shilling. i offered the money to my master, but he bade me keep it, and with it i bought a piece of horse flesh."
4375,4406-16883-0008.flac," it asked me whether i would smoke it. a usual compliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners. but this no way suited me. for though i had formerly used tobacco, yet i had left it ever since i was first taken."
4376,4406-16883-0034.flac," and would have had him gone back also, but he would not. but said he would go on and come to us again in three days, my spirit was upon this i confessed very impatient and almost outrageous."
4377,4406-16883-0019.flac," and sell me for powder, for so they had sometimes discourse. i was utterly hopeless of getting home on foot the way that i came. i could hardly bear to think of the many weary steps i had taken to come to this place. the 9-3 move."
4378,4406-16883-0017.flac, who owned that mary thurston and came running after me and got it away again.
4379,4406-16883-0025.flac," and then i returned again. when i was returned, i found myself as unsatisfied as i was before."
4380,4406-16883-0020.flac," but instead of going either to elden near home where we must go five miles up the river and then go over it, here we abode a while. here lived a sorry indian who spoke to me to make him a shirt when i had done it he would pay me nothing."
4381,4406-16883-0001.flac," and he lighted upon that comfortable scripture, i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord."
4382,4406-16883-0040.flac," and a good fire we had, and through the good providence of god, i had a comfortable lodging that night. in the morning, another indian bade me comment at night, and he would give me six ground nuts, which i did."
4383,4406-16883-0007.flac," then came one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me, and another gave me half a pint of peas, which was more worth than many bushels at another time. then i went to see king philip, he bade me come in and sit down,"
4384,4406-16883-0024.flac," i turned homeward again and met with my master, he showed me the way to my son. when i came to him i found him not well, and with all he had a boil on his side which much troubled him. we boned one another a while, as the lord helped us."
4385,4406-16883-0006.flac," by the rivers of babylon, there we sat down."
4386,4406-16883-0003.flac," in bringing to my hands so many comfortable and suitable scriptures in my distress, but to return."
4387,4406-16883-0004.flac," and in the morning, we must go over the river to fill up screw."
4388,4406-16883-0015.flac," hearing that my son was come to this place, i went to see him, and found him lying flat upon the ground. i asked him how he could sleep so, he answered me that he was not asleep, but at prayer, and lay so. they might not observe what he was doing."
4389,4406-16883-0032.flac," i lifted up my heart to god, hoping the redemption was not far off, and the rather because their insolency grew worse and worse. but the thoughts of my going homeward, for so we bent our course,"
4390,4406-16883-0038.flac," was i feigned to stoop to this rude fellow, and to go out in the night, i knew not with her. my eyes have seen that fellow afterwards walking up and down boston, under the appearance of a friend indian and several others of the light cut."
4391,4406-16883-0026.flac," my son was ill, and i could not but think of his mournful looks, and no christian friend was near him, to do any office of love for him, either for soul or body. and my poor girl, i knew not where she was, nor whether she was sick or well or alive or dead."
4392,4406-16883-0033.flac," much chewed my spirit, and made my burdens seem light, and almost nothing at all. but to my amazement and great perplexity, the scale soon turned. for when we had gone a little way, on a sudden, my mistress gives out."
4393,4406-16883-0027.flac," i repaired under these thoughts to my bible, my great comfort in that time, and that scripture came to my hand. cast thy burden upon the lord, and he shall sustain thee, psalm 55."
4394,4406-16883-0022.flac," and i was not a little glad that i had anything that they would accept of and be pleased with. when we were at this place, my master's maid came home. she had begun three weeks into the naragana set country to fetch corn."
4395,4406-16883-0041.flac," we went in the morning to gather ground-nuts to the river and went back. again, that night. i went with a good load at my back, for they, when they went, though but a little way, would carry all their trompery with them. i told them the skin was off my back."
4396,2136-5140-0012.flac," yet now to me it is but a picture in my brain and to you but a story told by me which you believe come dear, let us be going so we descended the steps at the right"
4397,2136-5140-0009.flac," and we walked in silence to the ballou strait. the base was too high at the spot where we reached it, for me to see over, but holding my hand, he said."
4398,2136-5140-0015.flac," would relate some little story, reflecting even to my childish mind, a strange suspicion of a spiritual meaning."
4399,2136-5140-0005.flac," there came to know where she died, a thin little man with large black eyes and a very grave dark face. he was shut up a good deal with my dear father, who was in deep affliction, and mrs. rusk used to say,"
4400,2136-5140-0025.flac," and the gray of that wondrous morning on which she stood by the empty sepulchre, accosted the figure standing near. your mama is alive, but too far away to see or hear us. swedenborg standing here can see and hear her,"
4401,2136-5140-0033.flac," holding his hand and looking stealthily. he smiled sadly and said, when sooner or later the time comes, as hegar's eyes were opened in the wilderness, and she beheld the fountain of water."
4402,2136-5140-0007.flac," and there was confusion in the house, and i dare say the maids made as much of a holiday as they could. i remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man, but i was not afraid of him for he was gentle though sad and seemed kind."
4403,2136-5140-0039.flac," white and shadowy in the moonlight, where for a long time after that ramble with the visionary, i fainting the gate of death, hidden only by a strange glamour, and the dazzling land of ghosts were situate."
4404,2136-5140-0034.flac," so shall each of us see the door open before us and enter in and be refreshed. for a long time following this walk, i was very nervous. more so for the awful manner in which mrs. rusk received my statement."
4405,2136-5140-0008.flac," he led me into the garden, the dutch garden we used to call it. with a ballu-straid and statues at the farther front, laid out in a carpet pattern of brilliant colored flowers. we came down the broad flight of cane-stone steps into this,"
4406,2136-5140-0024.flac," i was afraid to approach. oh, is mama taken away? where is she? where have they brought her to? i was uttering unconsciously, very nearly the question with which mary"
4407,2136-5140-0014.flac, the same on which i was now looking in the distance. every now and then he made me sit down to rest.
4408,2136-5140-0019.flac," and so went on weeping and calling wildly on the deaf and the silent. there was a stone bench some ten steps away from the tomb. sit down beside me, my child,"" said the grave man with the black eyes, very kindly and gently."
4409,2136-5140-0017.flac, we came to me quite unexpectedly in the deep silven shadows upon the gray pillar temple forfronted with a slanting pedestal of like-instained steps.
4410,2136-5140-0004.flac," in all that concerned his religion from very early association, there was to me something of the unearthly and spectral. when my dear mom died, i was not nine years old, and i remember two days before the funeral."
4411,2136-5140-0023.flac," and has told me all that concerns us to know. he says your mama is not there. she has taken away?"" i cried, starting up and with streaming eyes, gazing on the building which, though i stamped my feet in my distraction."
4412,2136-5140-0028.flac," how true the description is which i give you. i was very frightened, for i feared that when he had done his narrative."
4413,2136-5140-0029.flac," and of shadows where the dead were visible. he leaned his elbow on his knee and his forehead on his hand, which shaded his downcast eyes. in that attitude he described to me a beautiful landscape"
4414,2136-5140-0001.flac," hardly reached to the window at which i sat. the shorn grass sloped gently downward from the window till it met the broad level on which stood in clumps or solitarially scattered, some of the noblest timber in england."
4415,2136-5140-0030.flac," radiant with a wondrous light, in which rejoicing my mother moved along an airy path, ascending among mountains of fantastic height, and peaks melting in celestial coloring into the air."
4416,2136-5140-0026.flac," and tells me all he sees, just as i told you in the garden about the little boys in the cottage, and the trees in the flowers which you could not see."
4417,2136-5140-0038.flac," and interpreted the language of the bible. and as dear papa accepted their ideas, i am happy in thinking that they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy rit. leaning on my hand, i was now looking upon that solemn wood."
4418,2136-5140-0000.flac," as already detailed, that i was one night sitting at the great drawing room window, lost in the melancholy reveries of night, and in admiration of the moon-lighted scene, i was the only occupant of the room."
4419,2136-5140-0021.flac," yes, a stone wall with pillars too high for either you or me to see over, but... here he mentioned a name which i think must have been swedenborg."
4420,2136-5140-0018.flac," the lonely sepulchre in which i had the morning before seen poor mama laid. at the sight, the fountains of my grief reopened, and i cried bitterly, repeating, oh, mama, mama, where are you mama?"
4421,2136-5140-0002.flac," hore in the moonbeam stood those graceful trees casting their moveless shadows upon the grass, and in the background, crowning the undulation of the distance in masses, were piled those woods among which lay the solitary tomb,"
4422,2136-5140-0040.flac, and i suppose these earlier associations gave to my reverie about my father's coming visitor.
4423,2136-5140-0031.flac," he said the same words he had spoken before. come dear, let us go. oh, no, no, no, not now!"" i said, resisting and very much frightened. home, i mean dear."
4424,2136-5140-0003.flac," to me, funeral but glorious woods, which formed the background of the picture, my thoughts recurred to my father's mysterious intimations and the image of the approaching visitor, and a thought of the unknown journey saddened me."
4425,2136-5140-0013.flac," and there we stood in rich sunlight among the many objects he had described. ""'is this your house, my little man?' he asked of the children, pretty little rosy boys, who ascended, and he leaned with his open hand against the stem of one of the trees."
4426,2136-5140-0037.flac," but i grew after a day or two so nervous that i laid a design. it is enough for me to know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions, which so far from superseding confirmed"
4427,2136-5140-0036.flac," or frighten her out of her senses, and at lonely place. of these sweden-borgians, indeed, i know no more than i might learn from good mrs. rusks' very inaccurate talk. two or three of them crossed in the course of my early life."
4428,2136-5140-0016.flac," and somehow startling in its very vagueness. thus entertained, though a little awfully, i accompanied the dark mysterious little whippersnapper through the woodland glades."
4429,2136-5140-0032.flac," we cannot walk to the place i have described. we can only reach it through the gate of death, to which we are all tending young and old with sure steps. and where is the gate of death? i asked in a sort of whisper as we walk together."
4430,2136-5140-0006.flac," and good mr. clay ready at call in the village. much good that little black wipper snapper will do him. with that little black man on the day after the funeral, i was sent out for some reason, for a walk. my governess was ill, i know."
4431,2136-5140-0011.flac," growing by the walls and windows, and two little children are playing among the stems of the trees. and we are on our way there, and in a few minutes, shall be under those trees ourselves, and talking to those little children."
4432,2136-5140-0022.flac," i only know that it sounded to me like the name of a magician in a fairy tale. i fancied he lived in the wood which surrounded us and i began to grow frightened as he proceeded. but swedenborg sees beyond it, over and through it."
4433,2136-5140-0020.flac," now, what do you see there?"" he asked, pointing horizontally with his stick towards the center of the opposite structure. oh, that! that place where poor mama is!"
4434,2136-5140-0027.flac," so i can tell you now as i did then, and as we are both, i hope, walking on to the same place, just as we did to the trees and cottage."
4435,2136-5140-0010.flac," well, you can't, but i can see beyond it. shall i tell you what? i see ever so much. i see a cottage with a steep roof that looks like gold in the sunlight."
4436,2136-5140-0035.flac," with stern lips and upturned hands and eyes, and an angry exposculation. i do wonder at you, mary quince, letting the child walk into the woods with that limb of darkness. it is a mercy he did not show her the devil."
4437,2136-5143-0019.flac," do you think you'll have no dandaries what you call haunt my dear? why?"" said i, flushing and growing pale again. i felt quite afraid of madame and confounded at the suddenness of all this. because and weak stead."
4438,2136-5143-0016.flac," how solemn! murmur in madame, wet nobel toom."
4439,2136-5143-0005.flac," the master says you may have the brandy bottom of the dam, and i'm glad to be rid of it, i am."" the dam curtsied with a great smirk that was full of intangible hate and insult. better your own brandy if drink you must, exclaimed mrs. rusk."
4440,2136-5143-0026.flac," what good man is your father? very! the kindest darling, i don't know why it is, madame, i am so afraid of him, and never could tell him how much i love him. this confidential talking with madame strange to say,"
4441,2136-5143-0009.flac," madame was cool, frank, and fluent. the brandy was purely medicinal. she produced a document in the form of a note. dr. somebody presented his compliments to madame de la rogerre, and ordered her a table spoonful of brandy"
4442,2136-5143-0010.flac, and some drops of londonum whenever the pain of stomach returned.
4443,2136-5143-0040.flac," with which word she sees that joint, and laughing spitefully she twisted it suddenly back, i screamed while she continued to laugh. will you tell? yes, yes, let me go! i shrieked. she did not release it immediately, however."
4444,2136-5143-0002.flac," her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs, from which only she apprehended surprise. her great mouth was opened and her eyes absolutely goggled with eagerness. she was devouring all that was passing there."
4445,2136-5143-0038.flac, you do know everything of course.
4446,2136-5143-0028.flac," oh no, moffat, i have had nothing, but if the doctor came, it was not because he was quite well. but that doctor is a doctor in theology, i fancy. i know he is a sweet and borgian, and papa is so well he could not have come as a physician."
4447,2136-5143-0004.flac," i am so glad to find you, and you are dressed to come out. we shall have so pleasant walk."" at that moment, the door of my father's study opened, and mrs. rusk, with her dark energetic face very much flushed, stepped out in high excitement."
4448,2136-5143-0031.flac," as he met his will, my dear, every man's or he has he, especially so old,"
4449,2136-5143-0008.flac," madame had commissioned her to buy it in the town and convey it to her bedroom. upon this mrs. rus compounded the flask, and with anne beside her rather precipitately appeared before the master. he heard and summoned madame."
4450,2136-5143-0025.flac," with his arms round his knees, very wicked old old man his face was like, and white eyes so large. come away, madam, you are trying to frighten me."" i said in the childish anger with your company's fear. madame laughed in ugly laugh and said,"
4451,2136-5143-0017.flac," as i approached, i happened to look, i can't tell why, suddenly over my shoulder. i was startled for madame was grimacing after me with a vile, derisive distortion. she pretended to be seized with a fit of coffee."
4452,2136-5143-0020.flac, she says there is ghost. how dark is this place? and so many of the earth and family they are buried here is not so. how high antique are the trees all round and nobody comes near.
4453,2136-5143-0018.flac," but it would not do. she saw that i had detected her, and she laughed aloud."
4454,2136-5143-0039.flac," otherwise, i will break your little finger. tell me everything. i know nothing of papa's will. you don't know madam how you hurt me. let us speak of something else. you do know and you must tell petite doritit."
4455,2136-5143-0037.flac," he has never spoken of it to me. i know he loves me, that is enough."
4456,2136-5143-0027.flac," dr. breyer, the i think they call him. yes, a doctor, breyer, who remained a few days. so we begin to walk towards home, adam. do pray."
4457,2136-5143-0024.flac," do, madam, pray, speak of something else. what did they tell fu? but no, you are not afraid. i have seen the ghost myself. i saw one, for example, last night, shaped like a monkey sitting in the corner."
4458,2136-5143-0000.flac," chapter 6. a walk in the wood. two little pieces of bi-play in which i detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion. from the corner of the gallery, i one day saw her, when she thought i was out and all quiet,"
4459,2136-5143-0006.flac," you may come to the storeroom now or the butler can take it. and off-wisk misses rust for the backstair case. there had been no common skirmish on this occasion, but a pitched battle. madame had made a sort of pet of anne wickstead, an under-chamber-made."
4460,2136-5143-0043.flac," what cross girl? i will never play with you again, never. let us go home."" madame was silent and morose all the way home. she would not answer my questions and affected to be very lofty and offended."
4461,2136-5143-0033.flac," but you are not such fool as you feign yourself. no, no, you know everything. come, tell me all about. it is for your advantage, you know. what is in his will and when he wrote? but, madame, i really know nothing of it."
4462,2136-5143-0041.flac," but continued her torture and discordant laughter. at last, she finally released my finger."
4463,2136-5143-0035.flac, he will not come to lie here a day sooner by cause of that.
4464,2136-5143-0042.flac," what do you cry for, little fool? you've hurt me very much!"
4465,2136-5143-0034.flac, i can't say whether there is a will or not. let us talk of something else.
4466,2136-5143-0044.flac," this did not last very long, however, and she soon resumed her wanted ways, and she returned to the question of the will, but not so directly, and with more art."
4467,2136-5143-0029.flac, but still you know your father is old man.
4468,2136-5143-0007.flac, with a brandy bottle under her apron stealing upstairs.
4469,2136-5143-0001.flac, with her ear at the keyhole of papa's study.
4470,2136-5143-0021.flac," and madame rolled her eyes offly as if she expected to see something unearthly and indeed looked very like it herself. ""'come away, madame,' i said, growing frightened, and feeling that if i were once by any accident,"
4471,2136-5143-0011.flac, she claimed her medicine. man's estimate of woman is higher than woman's own. perhaps in their relations to men they are generally more trustworthy. perhaps woman is the juster and the other an appointed illusion.
4472,2136-5143-0036.flac, would not that be a pity? i really don't know anything of his will.
4473,2136-5143-0012.flac," i don't know, but so it is ordained. mrs. rusk was recalled, and i saw, as you are aware, madame's procedure during the interview. it was a great battle, a great victory. madame was in high spirits."
4474,2136-5143-0014.flac," but such resolutions do not last long with very young people, and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood, we were talking pretty much as usual. i don't wish to go into the wood, madame. and for what? poor mama has buried there."
4475,2136-5143-0015.flac, is the arch the vot demanded madame eagerly? i ascended. my faith curious reason. you say because poor mama is buried there you will not approach.
4476,2136-5143-0022.flac," to give way to the panic that was gathering around me, i should instantaneously lose all control of myself. oh come away, do me down, i'm frightened. no, on the contrary, sit here by me."
4477,2136-5143-0003.flac," inding nation, however, quickly returned, and i came back, treading briskly as i did so. when i reached the angle of the gallery again, madame, i suppose, had heard me, where she was halfway down the stairs."
4478,2136-5143-0030.flac," oh yes, he is old man."
4479,2136-5143-0032.flac," there is no need of haste, madame. it is quite time enough when his health begins to fail."
4480,2136-5143-0013.flac," the air was sweet, the landscape charming. i, so good, everything so beautiful. where should we go this way? i had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to madame. i was so incense that the treachery i had witnessed."
4481,2136-5143-0023.flac, on goobiesa rehmon. but i love very much to be near to the dead people.
4482,2136-5147-0040.flac," madam uttered a slumbering moan and turned more upon her face, clasping the coverlet faster about her. madam, it is mod and lady-nulless. we have come to relieve your ear. pray, let me see it."
4483,2136-5147-0011.flac, looking down from the corners of her eyes in an interesting dejection.
4484,2136-5147-0004.flac, but she may also be about the most pernicious inmate imaginable. she may teach you a bad accent.
4485,2136-5147-0025.flac," and it is really such a pity, for she's a very pretty creature and a clever woman could make her quite charming."
4486,2136-5147-0014.flac," you save the emalads, he never visit earth."" she replied with a startled sort of tartness and a momentary energy. besides, i cannot converse."
4487,2136-5147-0016.flac," simple as i was, i felt instinctively that madame was shaming. she was overacting her transitions were too violent, and beside she forgot that i knew how well she could speak english, and must perceive that she was heightening the interest of her helplessness."
4488,2136-5147-0005.flac," and heaven knows what beside. send the housekeeper my dear to tell her that i am going to see her. i had better go myself perhaps."" i said, fearing the collision between mrs. rusk and the bitter frenchwoman. very well dear."
4489,2136-5147-0002.flac," but she is ill, i answered, and all this time i was ready to cry for vexation, thinking of my dress, which must be very absurd to elicit so much unaffected laughter from my experienced relative."
4490,2136-5147-0032.flac," i suppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at nol, and thought it no harm to excite my vigilance. but it was impossible long to be vexed with kazanmanaka."
4491,2136-5147-0030.flac," and think that no widower is quite above or below that danger. and i remember whenever my father which indeed was but seldom, made a visit to town or anywhere else, it was a saying of mrs. rusk."
4492,2136-5147-0039.flac," getting round to the side of the bed and stooping over her. madame lay still as a mouse. cousin monica set down her two little vials on the table, and stooping again over the bed, began very gently with her fingers to lift the coverlet that covered her face."
4493,2136-5147-0026.flac," eight and twenty years ago or more with 120,000 pounds. well, you know she has got ever so much now."
4494,2136-5147-0029.flac," but it won't do. no, no, monica. we must take care of little mods some other way. i was relieved. we women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages."
4495,2136-5147-0006.flac," not sorry somehow to escape before captain oakley returned. as i went along the passage, i was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it, and trying in vain."
4496,2136-5147-0003.flac," is she up or in bed? in her room, but not in bed. i should so like to see her, my dear. it is not mere curiosity. i assure you. in fact, curiosity has nothing on earth to do with it."
4497,2136-5147-0022.flac," and has gone to the billiard room, i think."
4498,2136-5147-0020.flac," since the pain will not allow me to remain longer. so with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused,"
4499,2136-5147-0017.flac," by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom. i therefore said with a kind of courage, which sometimes helped me suddenly. oh, madame, don't you really think you might, without much inconvenience, see lady nalus for a very few minutes."
4500,2136-5147-0021.flac, i returned to the drawing room.
4501,2136-5147-0007.flac," to recollect any evidence of a similar, contemptuous estimate on the part of that beautiful and garyllist dandy. i could not quite the reverse indeed. still, i was uncomfortable and feverish."
4502,2136-5147-0033.flac," you know, my dear, your father is an oddity."" she said. i don't mind him, i never did. you must not. cracky, my dear, cracky, decidedly cracky. and she tapped the corner of her forehead with a look so sligh and comical."
4503,2136-5147-0009.flac," how is madame?"" i asked. quite well, i believe. and should the housekeeper dryly? nothing the matter that i know of. she eat enough for two today."
4504,2136-5147-0038.flac," there was no answer. so she opened the door, and we both entered. madame had rolled herself in the blue coverlet and was lying on the bed, with her face buried in the pillow, and enveloped in the covering. perhaps she's asleep, said lady nolis."
4505,2136-5147-0013.flac," and with these words, she turned a languid glance of gratitude on me, which dropped on the ground. lady nolis wishes very much to see you, only for a few minutes if you could admit her."
4506,2136-5147-0037.flac, and there was a fumbling at the handle. but the bolt was out of order.
4507,2136-5147-0027.flac," and though you would not have her then, she has had her second husband since i can tell you. i'm glad i was not the first,"" said my father. while they really say her wealth is absolutely immense, her last husband,"
4508,2136-5147-0010.flac," i try to swallow a little to please her. and you're cold. is it better?"" she shook her head languageily, her elbow resting on the chair, and three fingertips supporting her forehead. and then she made a little sigh."
4509,2136-5147-0031.flac," i shan't wonder, neither need you, magia, if he brings home a young wife with him. so my father, with a kind look at her, and a very tender one on me, went silently to the library, as he often did about that hour."
4510,2136-5147-0028.flac," the russian merchant left her everything. she has not a human relation and she is in the best set. you were always a matchmaker monica."" said my father, stopping and putting his hand kindly on hers."
4511,2136-5147-0036.flac," she scaled the stairs, eye following, and having found the remedies, we approached madam's room together. i think, while we were still at the end of the gallery, madam heard and devined our approach. for her door suddenly shut."
4512,2136-5147-0001.flac," she is my governess of finishing governess, mrs. rusk says. finishing fiddle. hoidi toidi and my ladies too, grand, to cut out your dresses and help you sew them. and what does she do?"
4513,2136-5147-0035.flac," pain in her ear, you say, poor thing. well, dear, i think i can cure that in five minutes. i have it myself now and then. come to my room and we'll get the bottles. so she lighted her candle in the lobby and with a light and agile step."
4514,2136-5147-0000.flac," lady nalus pursued her inquiries. and why does not madame make your dresses, my dear? i wager again the woman's a milliner. did not she engage to make your dresses? i..."
4515,2136-5147-0018.flac," but it is impossible, you must see, quite impossible. i never, you know, refuse to take trouble when i am able. never, never!"" and madame shed some tears, which always came at call."
4516,2136-5147-0024.flac," yes, and really austin, it is quite clear you ought to marry. you want someone to take this girl out and look after her, and who's to do it?"
4517,2136-5147-0023.flac," that, then, accounted for the rumble and smack of balls, which i had heard as i passed the door. i have been telling maud how detestably she has got up. very thoughtful of you, monica,"" said my father."
4518,2136-5147-0034.flac," that i think i should have laughed if this sentiment had not been so awfully irreverent. well, dear, how is our friend the milliner? madame is suffering so much from pain in her ear that she says it would be quite impossible to have the honor, honor, fiddle!"
4519,2136-5147-0019.flac," and with her hand pressed to her ear, said very faintly, be so good to tell your friend how you see me, and how i suffer."

4552,5652-19215-0026.flac, her heart and the louvre. her heart and the grand waterworks of versailles. give me my shepherdness and try to make her a duchess. fetch me phyllis crowned with cornflowers and add a hundred thousand franks income.
4553,5652-19215-0045.flac," or a tough to roses, whether he was a shepherd or a warrior. and if, by chance, one was a captain of dragons,"
4554,5652-19215-0006.flac," and, apparently, with as much joy as kuzet herself. as he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicate problem."
4555,5652-19215-0010.flac," she was declared an orphan, both father and mother being dead."
4556,5652-19215-0011.flac, that he was appointed under the name of foschulant as cosette's guardian.
4557,5652-19215-0053.flac," you must make a dream, whirl around the bride. a marriage should be royal and chymrucule. it should promimate its ceremony from the cathedral of the rhymes to the pagoda of shantaru."
4558,5652-19215-0025.flac," thanks, monious, that is precisely the idea of which i was in search. and on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea rose-colored, monée and teak was added to cosette's wedding presence."
4559,5652-19215-0030.flac," it ignores the noble. in everything it is clean shayven. your thought estate is in sippard, colourless, odorless and shapeless. the dreams of your bourgeois who set up, as they express it, a pretty buddha,"
4560,5652-19215-0043.flac," gamacho entered. but in seuth, the stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants to have its wedding also."
4561,5652-19215-0051.flac, and do you know what one arrives at with that majesty? at being petty? learn this. joy is not only joyous. it is great. but be in love galley then.
4562,5652-19215-0052.flac," what the doose, marry when you marry with fever and giddiness and tumult and the off-roar of happiness. be grave in church, well and good, but as soon as the mass is finished,"
4563,5652-19215-0004.flac," the transition had not been softened, and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it. do you understand anything about it, said marius, to cosette? no, replied cosette, but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us."
4564,5652-19215-0057.flac," receives no impressions, either human or pleasant or painful, with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes. this devotion"
4565,5652-19215-0007.flac," a sure means of not encountering any objections. cosette was the only zion of an extinct family. cosette was not his own daughter, but the daughter of the other fosulans. two brother fosulans had been gardeners to the covenant,"
4566,5652-19215-0056.flac," do not prune them of their splendors. don't scrimp on the day when you beam. the wedding is not the housekeeping. oh, if i were to carry out my fancy, it would be gallant. violins would be heard under the trees."
4567,5652-19215-0029.flac," equal to that. for my part, i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasbourg and i prefer it to the kuku clock from the black forest."
4568,5652-19215-0060.flac," she would have left him poor. so much the worst for my nephew. he is wedding a beggar. let him be a beggar himself. but because that's half million, please the aunt, and altered her inward situation so far,"
4569,5652-19215-0005.flac," jean-valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, arranged everything, made everything easy."
4570,5652-19215-0038.flac," the fine-spun-galloned compliments, the songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, the devil's own row, the huge knots of ribbon, i regret the bride's garter. the bride's garter is cousin to the girdle of venus."
4571,5652-19215-0061.flac," one owes some consideration to 600,000 francs. i mean, it was evident that she could not do otherwise, then leave her fortune to these young people since they did not need it."
4572,5652-19215-0034.flac, give me permission to speak. i say no evil of the people as you see. i'm always harping on your people.
4573,5652-19215-0049.flac," your century is unfortunate. people would drive away the graces as being too low in the neck. alas, beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness. since the revolution,"
4574,5652-19215-0050.flac," everything, including the ballet dances, has had its trousers. a mountain bank dancer must be grave. your rigged dunes are doctrine."
4575,5652-19215-0027.flac, i remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasbourg a clock.
4576,5652-19215-0003.flac," maris, my boy, you are a baron. you are rich. don't go to petty foggy and i beg of you."
4577,5652-19215-0033.flac," i grant to this age the device, dirty cleanliness."
4578,5652-19215-0046.flac, people thought much of looking well. they embroidered and tinted themselves. a bourgeois had the air of a flower. a marquee had the air of a precious stone. people had no straps to their boots. they had no boots.
4579,5652-19215-0048.flac," one of the sides of that century was delicate. the other was magnificent. and by the green cabbages, people amuse themselves. today, people are serious. the bourgeois is averse. the bourgeois is a prude."
4580,5652-19215-0000.flac," everything was made ready for the wedding. the doctor, on being consulted, declared that it might take place in february. it was then, december. a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed."
4581,5652-19215-0041.flac, homo would construct the iliad. he would put in his poem.
4582,5652-19215-0018.flac, nothing so amused him as being magnificent. he had given to cousette.
4583,5652-19215-0015.flac," that the cloud did not last long. she had marius. the young man arrived, the old man was effaced, such is life. and then, because that had for long years, been habituated to see an enigma's around her."
4584,5652-19215-0035.flac," i belong to it. he who loves well, lash as well. thereupon, i say plainly, that nowadays,"
4585,5652-19215-0047.flac," they were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty, coquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their sides. the hummingbird has beacon claws."
4586,5652-39938-0066.flac, everything is to be avoided which interferes with the night's sleep.
4587,5652-39938-0065.flac," while the advice of the physician ought thus to emphasize the positive elements which work, not towards rest, but toward a harmonious mental activity, we must not forget some essential negative prescriptions."
4588,5652-39938-0019.flac," the finest adjustment has to come in during the treatment itself, and the response of the patient often has to suggest entirely new lines of procedure."
4589,5652-39938-0035.flac," every cause of friction, which can be permanently annihilated for the patient, certainly should be removed. this negative remedy demands its positive supplement."
4590,5652-39938-0053.flac, every effort should be estimated with reference to the standard of that particular case. this relativity of the mental reaction on the demands of life must always be in the foreground of the psychotherapeutic regime.
4591,5652-39938-0022.flac," it cannot be denied that the one great obstacle in the work of the routine physician is the lack of time and patience, which is needed for successful treatment. to prescribe drugs is always quicker than to influence the mind."
4592,5652-39938-0056.flac," they should not be complete, rest, or complete change of life for any length of time, but a continuation of the life for which adjustment has been learned with a reasonable reduction of the demands and stimulations."
4593,5652-39938-0047.flac," of course, we stand today before a much more complex surrounding than our ancestors, but still more quickly than the complexity have grown to means to master it."
4594,5652-39938-0051.flac," if i have a 10 pound weight in one hand, i may find that i must have one pound more in the other hand to discriminate the difference."
4595,5652-39938-0028.flac, especially in the digestive and sexual spheres are sources of irritation which slowly influence the whole personality.
4596,5652-39938-0052.flac, yet that quiet countryman may react in his narrow system not less when the monos changes in his surroundings provoke him. the gossip of his neighbor may undermine his nervous system just as much as a political fight or the struggles of the exchange that of the cityman.
4597,5652-39938-0021.flac, settle adjustment to the personal needs and to the individual conditions is necessary in every case where the cyclical factor is to play an important role.
4598,5652-39938-0057.flac," the intellectual worker ought to decrease his work, the overbusy society woman ought to stay in bed one day in the week. the man in the midst of the rush of life ought to cut down his obligations."
4599,5652-39938-0032.flac, we may be guided by the psychological experiments which have been made in the interest of testing the fatigue induced by mental work.
4600,5652-39938-0004.flac," the intellectual clearness of the patient too easily tempts one into trusting the sincerity of his story. and yet the most important idea is clustering, perhaps about love or ambition, about vice or crime, about business failure or family secrets."
4601,5652-39938-0064.flac," in the second place come games in sport, which may enter into their right if fatigue can be avoided. harmonia's joyful company, as different as possible from the depressing company of the sanitariums, will add its pleasantness."
4602,5652-39938-0059.flac, that they are interruptions of that which must last and that they are not themselves to become lasting states.
4603,5652-39938-0050.flac," above all the intensity of mental stimuli is always relative. the psychologist knows the experiments, which determine that we perceive the difference of impressions as alike when the stimuli are proportional."
4604,5652-39938-0020.flac," more than in any other field of medicine, the physician himself has to extend his influence far beyond the office hours and the strictly medical relations. and yet, on the other hand, there is no department of medicine in which the treatment might not profit by the psychotherapeutic influence."
4605,5652-39938-0041.flac, the overexcitement brought to everybody by the sensationalism of our newspapers and of our public life all injure the brain cells and damage the equilibrium.
4606,5652-39938-0055.flac," complete rest, for instance, for a hard brain worker, hardly ought to be recommended unless a high degree of exhaustion has come on. if routine prescriptions are to be admitted at all,"
4607,5652-39938-0034.flac," the instinct of the physician has to find the middle way between a temporary removal of the irritation, which really allows a development of new energies, and a mere interruption, which simply damages the acquired relative adjustment."
4608,5652-39938-0007.flac," we'll support the physician and accordingly his examination is not obliged to trap the patient, but simply to guide him to important points. but then begins the most essential study of diagnostical differentiation."
4609,5652-39938-0031.flac, often within a surprisingly short time the brain gathers the energies to overcome the frictions with unavoidable surroundings. yet here the physician has to adjust the prescribed dose of outing very carefully to the special case.
4610,5652-39938-0005.flac, withheld and may frustrate every psychotherapeutic influence. where suspicion is awake and mere confidential talk and persuasion seem insufficient.
4611,5652-39938-0015.flac, every element of a man's life history impressions of early childhood his love and his successes his diseases and his distresses his acquaintances and his reading his talent his character his sincerity his energy his intelligence
4612,5652-39938-0045.flac," earlier times, surely may have treated even the stronger varieties of this kind as trouble some variations in the sphere of the normal."
4613,5652-39938-0048.flac, there is no nation on earth which is more proud of its rush and its hurry than the american people and yet wouldn't
4614,5652-39938-0016.flac, everything ought to determine the choice of the psychotherapeutic steps. as it is entirely impossible to determine all those factors by any sufficient inquiry.
4615,5652-39938-0036.flac," the patient must be brought under conditions and influences which give fair chances for the recuperation of his energies. too often from the standpoint of the psychologist, the prescription is simply rest."
4616,5652-39938-0037.flac," as far as rest involves sleep, it is certainly the ideal prescription. there is no other influence which builds up the injured central nervous system as safely as sound natural sleep."
4617,5652-39938-0024.flac," namely, to remove the external sources of the disturbance. external indicates they're not only the outer world, but also the own body outside the conscious parts of the brain."
4618,5652-39938-0030.flac, however often he may get the impression that such a liberation would stop the source of the mental trouble.
4619,5652-39938-0003.flac, it is surprising how often unsuspected vistas of thoughts and impulses and emotions are open by an anchoring analysis where the direct report of the patient does not awaken the least suspicion.
4620,5652-39938-0026.flac, growths and the nose may be operated upon the astigmatic or the short-sighted eye may be corrected by glasses. the child who is heart of hearing may at least be seated near the teacher. and the backward children quickly reach the average level.
4621,5652-39938-0062.flac," the most effective agency for this task is contact with beauty, beauty in nature and life, beauty in art and literature and music."
4622,5652-39938-0025.flac," if we take it in the widest meaning, this would evidently include every possible medical task from filling a painful tooth to operating on a painful appendix. as in every case where pain results, the mental equilibrium is disturbed by it and the normal mental life of the patient reduced in its efficiency."
4623,5652-39938-0000.flac," the psychological work of the physician does not begin with his curative efforts. therapy is always only the last step. diagnosis and observation have to precede, and an inquiry into the causes of the disease is essential."
4624,5652-39938-0013.flac," there are no two cases of like, and not only the easily recognizable differences of sex and age, and occupation and education, and financial means, and temperament and capacity are decisive."
4625,5652-39938-0058.flac, but probably each of them does better to go on than simply to swear off altogether. their rest ought to have the character of vacation. that means interruptions without the usual activity ought to be short periods spent with the distinct feeling
4626,5652-39938-0001.flac," the whole equipment of the modern laboratory ought to be put at its disposal. perceptions and associations, reactions and expressions ought to be examined with the same carefulness with which the conscientious physician examines the blood and the urine."
4627,5652-39938-0060.flac," strenuosity must not mean an external rush with the gestures of overbusy excitement, but certainly the doctrine of the lazy life is reached psychotherapy, as long as no serious illness is in question."
4628,5652-39938-0029.flac," to be sure, the brain disturbance may have reached a point where the mere removal of the original affliction is not sufficient to reinstate the normal balance of mental energies, but wherever such a bodily irritation goes on, it is never too late to abolish it in the interests of psychotherapy."
4629,5652-39938-0042.flac, that is a story which we hear a thousand times nowadays. yet it is doubtful whether there is really much truth in such a claim and whether much wise psychotherapy can be deduced from it.
4630,5652-39938-0018.flac," it is therefore certainly not enough that the knowledge of the physician simply decide beforehand on a definite course of psychical treatment, and leave the carrying out to a well-meaning minister or any other medical amateur who schematically follows the indicated path."
4631,5652-39938-0040.flac," the wild chase for luxury in the higher classes reinforced by the commercialism of our time, the hard and the monotonous labor in our modern mills and mines for the lower classes."
4632,5652-39938-0012.flac," but one rule is common to all of them. never use psychotherapeutic methods in a schematic way like a rigid pattern. schematic treatment is a poor treatment in every department of medicine, but in psychotherapeutics it is disastrous."
4633,5652-39938-0061.flac," by far, the best alteration is, therefore, even in the periods of interruption, not simply rest but new engagements which awaken new interests and simulate negative mental factors. disburdening the overstrained elements of mental life."
4634,5652-39938-0044.flac, even today most people are still without suspicion that a neuro-acenic or a psycho-acenic or a historic disturbance of the nervous system may be in its beginning.
4635,5652-39938-0014.flac," but all the subtle variations of prejudices and beliefs, preferences and dislikes, family life and social surroundings, ambitions and prospects, memories and fancies."
4636,5652-39938-0008.flac," with all the means not only of psychology but of neurology and internal medicine, he has to separate the particular case from similar ones and to examine whether he deals with, for instance, a hysteric or with a paranoic."
4637,5652-39938-0002.flac, and yet no psychological treatment can start successfully so long as the patient is burning on secret thoughts at the bottom of his mind. the desire to hide them may often be itself a part of the disease.
4638,5652-39938-0049.flac," moreover, our life has probably become cooler. there is less emotionalism, less sentimentality, more business like attitude, and that all means less inner friction and excitement. in public life too, less fear of war and less religious struggle."
4639,5652-39938-0043.flac, we may begin even with the very justifiable doubts whether nervousness really has increased in our time. earlier periods had not so many names for those symptoms and were not able to discriminate them with the same clearness.
4640,5652-39938-0011.flac," in a similar way, the psychological examination tests the hallucinations and illusions, the variations and defects of memory and attention, of judgment and reasoning, of orientation and self-consciousness, of emotions and volitions,"
4641,5652-39938-0033.flac," if perhaps four hours of concentrated work are done without pauses, experiments show that the quality of the work deteriorates, measured for instance by the number of mistakes in quick calculation."
4642,5652-39938-0023.flac, the first method to bring back the psychophysical equilibrium.
4643,5652-39938-0046.flac," the progress of scientific hygiene has brought everyone much near to a harmonious functioning of the organism, and the progress of technique has removed innumerable difficulties from the play of life."
4644,5652-39938-0009.flac," and he will not forget that there are almost no symptoms of serious diseases, which the nervous system of the hysteric may not imitate for a time."
4645,5652-39938-0017.flac," most of the adjustment of method must be left to the instinct of the physician, in which wide experience, solid knowledge, tact and sympathy ought to be blended. even the way in which the patient reacts on the method will often guide the instinct of the well-trained psychotherapist."
4646,5652-39938-0038.flac," and loss of sleep is certainly one of the most pernicuous conditions for the brain. again, rest is a great factor in those systemic rest cures, which for a long while were almost the fashion with the neurologist."
4647,5652-39938-0006.flac," the physician may feel justified in the interest of his patient in drawing the thoughts out of their hiding place by artificial means. skill, tact, and experience are needed there. as a matter of course,"
4648,5652-39938-0054.flac, simply to withdraw a patient from the one kind of life.
4649,5652-39938-0027.flac," no doubt in the life of the adult as well. often almost insignificant and from a strictly physical point of view, unimportant abnormalities in the bodily system"
4650,5652-39938-0039.flac," it is simply meant that he give up his fatiguing daily work, even if that work is made up of a round of entertainments and calls and social engagements. the neuroesthetic and all similar varieties are sent away from the noise of the city, away from the rush of their busy life."
4651,5652-39938-0010.flac," not ours is the task of analyzing special methods of neurological and mental differential diagnosis, such as are used in the psychiatric clinic and in the office of the nerve specialist. they're the family history with reference to nervous and other diseases."
4652,5652-39938-0063.flac, to enjoy a landscape ought to be not merely a negative rest for the man of the office building and good literature or music absorbs the mental energies and harmonizes them.
4653,211-122442-0022.flac," besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st. cloud?"
4654,211-122442-0043.flac," the triumph of the queen, and the humiliation of his eminence, you must look out for yourself. what if i'd a fear replied dartanian as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesty's? everything, believe me,"
4655,211-122442-0055.flac, which may betray him who wears it. sell this ring? a ring which comes from my sovereign? never said dartanian. then at least turn the gym inside you silly fellow. for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gaskini.
4656,211-122442-0033.flac," is only that i may know whether i am delaying you. why that question, my dear host, asked dartanian, do you intend to sit up for me? no, but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house, i am alarmed every time i hear a door open."
4657,211-122442-0051.flac," oh, the women, the women cried the old soldier. i know them by their romantic imagination. everything that savers of mystery charms them. so you have seen the arm, that was all. you would meet the queen, and she would not know who you are."
4658,211-122442-0052.flac," no, but thanks to this diamond, replied the young man."
4659,211-122442-0021.flac," dartanian's intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer, but the latter made so polite and friendly a cellutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop, but to enter into conversation with him."
4660,211-122442-0063.flac," by the by, you can be sure of your lacking. miss trust, everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress, your mistress above all. dartanian blushed. my mistress above all repeated he mechanically."
4661,211-122442-0011.flac," exactly. but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way and to shut up houses, fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven."
4662,211-122442-0061.flac," shun it. we're it with a child of 10 years old. if you are attacked by day or by night, fight but retreat without shame. if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot."
4663,211-122442-0069.flac, and how the devil did you escape?
4664,211-122442-0007.flac, there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you. be this evening about 10 o'clock at st. cloud.
4665,211-122442-0054.flac," well then, off to the nearest goldsmiths and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him. however much of a jew he may be, he will give you at least 800 pistoles. pistoles have no name, young man, and that ring has a terrible one."
4666,211-122442-0005.flac," it is not natural for letters to enter people's houses in this manner. if the window had been open or even a jar, i should think nothing of it. but no, always hermetically sealed."
4667,211-122442-0049.flac," by whom did the queen send you this jewel, she gave it to me herself, where, in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet? how, giving me her hand to kiss,"
4668,211-122442-0015.flac," i'm going out for all day, perhaps. you are therefore your own master till 7 o'clock in the evening. but at 7 o'clock, you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses."
4669,211-122442-0006.flac," there is certainly some magic underneath. meanwhile, the young man had darted into his chamber and opened the letter."
4670,211-122442-0042.flac," now, let us talk about yourself, my young friend."
4671,211-122442-0035.flac, that dartanian could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter.
4672,211-122442-0059.flac, has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command? the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested. what? will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty's service? part 2.
4673,211-122442-0066.flac, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess.
4674,211-122442-0044.flac," the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier, and the mystifier appears to me to have the heir of being a certain young guest gone of my acquaintance. do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself?"
4675,211-122442-0077.flac, was busy grooming them and had already finished too.
4676,211-122442-0016.flac, we are going again at appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways. you will take your musketune and your pistols.
4677,211-122442-0060.flac," at all events, young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost. but on the contrary, and it is i who say it. see enemies in all directions. if anyone seeks a quarrel with you,"
4678,211-122442-0039.flac, he certainly would not have remarked it.
4679,211-122442-0072.flac," it is woman who has ruined us, still ruins us, and will ruin us, as long as the world stands. take my advice and set out this evening."
4680,211-122442-0070.flac, they merit richly that piece of attention on your part.
4681,211-122442-0027.flac, brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris.
4682,211-122442-0079.flac," but why this question? because, while you were talking with him, i watched you without listening to you."
4683,211-122442-0002.flac," when he was left stiff as a rush in london, and the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses. has anyone brought a letter for me? asked our tangon eagerly."
4684,211-122442-0050.flac," her matchstead didn't mean the honor to grant me that favor. and that in the presence of witnesses, thrice imprudent!"
4685,211-122442-0037.flac," this evening will come, thank god, and perhaps you look for it with as much in patience as i do. perhaps this evening, madem, bernice, will visit the conjugal domicile."
4686,211-122442-0030.flac," as i see there is no concealing anything from you. yes, i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge."
4687,211-122442-0073.flac," ah, that's quite another thing, but promise me if you should not be killed tonight, that you will go tomorrow. i promise it. do you need money?"
4688,211-122442-0076.flac," as he passed the hotel day guard, he took a glance into the stables. three of the four horses had already arrived."
4689,211-122442-0045.flac, and knows that i have been to london. the devil you have been to london? was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger? beware my dear darthanian. a present from an enemy is not a good thing.
4690,211-122442-0019.flac," well, then, i count on you. at the appointed hour, i shall be ready."
4691,211-122442-0080.flac," two or three times. ba! preoccupied as majora was with the letter he had received, he did not observe that, but i, whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house, had placed on my guard, i did not lose a movement of his features."
4692,211-122442-0038.flac," so much the worst for you, my dear host, so much the worst. when i am happy i wish all the world to be so, but it appears that is not possible. the young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone could comprehend. a muse yourself well replied, bernice, though."
4693,211-122442-0074.flac, but your companions? i don't think they can be in need of any. we love to pair us each with 75 pistolais in his pocket. shall i see you again before your departure?
4694,211-122442-0018.flac, i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear.
4695,211-122442-0028.flac," far from here? oh lord, know about forty leagues only."
4696,211-122442-0024.flac," oumie never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinals executioner, an expatiated at great link upon the bastille, the bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of torture."
4697,211-122442-0023.flac, the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man.
4698,211-122442-0000.flac," he found the door of his passage open, spring up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey."
4699,211-122442-0062.flac," lest one should give way beneath you. if you pass before a house which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head. if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be armed. if…"
4700,211-122442-0009.flac," his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy, though ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love."
4701,211-122442-0047.flac, beware of the enemy who makes you presence.
4702,211-122442-0031.flac," and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence, continue the mercer."
4703,211-122442-0071.flac," young man, young man, some flirtation or other."
4704,211-122442-0067.flac, what has become of your three companions.
4705,211-122442-0040.flac," his visit of the day before it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little explicative. he found treville in a joyful mood. he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball. it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill-tempered."
4706,211-122442-0056.flac," does not find such stones in his mother's jewel case. you think then i have something to dread? ask dartanian? i mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine, the match of which is already lighted,"
4707,211-122442-0008.flac," while reading this letter, dartinian felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers. it was the first billet he had received. it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him."
4708,211-122442-0075.flac," neither of them had returned. their lackeys likewise were absent, and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other."
4709,211-122442-0064.flac, you are acquainted with the scriptures?
4710,211-122442-0036.flac," which sees me all at once, and i have just felt a cold shiver. pay no attention to it. you have nothing to occupy yourself with, but being happy. then i have full occupation for i am so. not yet. wait a little. this evening you said. well."
4711,211-122442-0017.flac," ah, like the charming journey the other day."
4712,211-122442-0013.flac," which the liberality of dartinian had not it entirely effaced. left alone, dartinian red and re-red his belay, then he kissed and re-kissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress."
4713,211-122442-0053.flac, shall i give you council? good council? the council of a friend?
4714,211-122442-0081.flac," and you found it, traitorous manjour. indeed."
4715,211-122442-0083.flac, he had to profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse.
4716,211-122442-0026.flac, in a time of perfect good fellowship. what has become of you all these days?
4717,211-122442-0048.flac, why it is indeed a true royal jewel.
4718,211-122442-0057.flac, the devil said dartanian.
4719,211-122442-0014.flac," at length, he went to bed, fell asleep and had golden dreams."
4720,211-122442-0025.flac," but artenon listened to him with exemplary complacence, and when he had finished said, and madame bernesot, do you know who carried her off? for i do not forget that i owed that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance."
4721,211-122442-0034.flac," particularly in the night. what the do's can you expect? i am no swordsman. well, don't be alarmed if i return at 1, 2, or 3 o'clock in the morning."
4722,211-122442-0078.flac," how glad i am to see you. why so ploshay, ask the young man?"
4723,211-122442-0065.flac," for that very evening, but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero."
4724,211-122442-0020.flac," perhaps there is but one at this moment, but by this evening there will be four. it appears that our journey was a remelding journey then? exactly so,"" said our tannion, and nodding to plasheye, he went out."
4725,211-122442-0004.flac, i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom. and where is that letter?
4726,211-122442-0003.flac," but one has come of itself. what do you mean, blackhead? i mean to say that when i came in, although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket,"
4727,211-122442-0001.flac," whom he had sent home two hours before from the hotel, deville telling him to sit up for him, opened the door for him. the reader may ask,"
4728,211-122442-0029.flac," where my friends still remain. and you have returned, have you not?"
4729,211-122442-0010.flac, did i not guess truly? is it not some bad affair?
4730,211-122442-0046.flac," are there not some latin verses upon that subject? stop! yes, doubtless replied dortanian."
4731,211-122442-0068.flac, detained by an accusation of coining.
4732,211-122442-0082.flac, shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction.
4733,211-122442-0012.flac," my dear plashe, i am the happiest of men."
4734,211-122442-0032.flac," so trifling indeed that dartanian did not perceive it anymore, then he had the momentary shade, which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the worthy man. ah, may you be a true prophet, said dartanian laughing. no."
4735,211-122442-0058.flac," the devil, what must i do? above all things, be always on your guard. the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm. you may depend upon it. he will repay you by some ill-turn. but of what sort?"
4736,211-122442-0041.flac," he had retired at one o'clock under the pretense of being indisposed, as to their majesty's they did not return to the louvre till six o'clock in the morning. now, said the reveal, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone,"
4737,211-122425-0072.flac," in addition to the sword thrust in his arm, which is not dangerous."
4738,211-122425-0078.flac, returned to his hotel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner.
4739,211-122425-0079.flac, that his eminence's guardsman had received.
4740,211-122425-0071.flac, not to accept the proposal i'm about to make to you.
4741,211-122425-0069.flac," we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other, and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair."
4742,211-122425-0081.flac, his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter.
4743,211-122425-0074.flac," perfectly. does he talk? with difficulty, but he can speak."
4744,211-122425-0075.flac, let us adore him and the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear. to speak the truth.
4745,211-122425-0080.flac," not only as good comrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his."
4746,211-122425-0073.flac, of which the doctor says bad things.
4747,211-122425-0076.flac," then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it. both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay. the latter, on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him, endeavour to raise himself up in his bed."
4748,211-122425-0070.flac, and all the fault is with your miscuteers.
4749,211-122425-0077.flac," place between life and death as bernadier was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth, and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed."
4750,211-122425-0040.flac," that they did not even perceive their young companion go out. who, as he had told the guardsman of his eminence, stopped outside the door. an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn."
4751,211-122425-0041.flac," which was fixed for midday, cast his eyes around, and sing that the street was empty said to his adversary. my fate, it is fortunate for you, although your name is bernageau, to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer."
4752,211-122425-0007.flac," i had 80 louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of, justice before everything."
4753,211-122425-0044.flac," he hoped to intimidate. but dartanian had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship. fresh, sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor, he was resolved not to recoil a step. so the two swords were crossed close to the hills."
4754,211-122425-0009.flac," and who have, i dare affirm to the king, his service much at heart, three of my best soldiers, i say."
4755,211-122425-0013.flac," then, upon seeing my musketeers, they changed their minds, and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred, for your majesty could not be ignorant that the musketeers who belonged to the king, and nobody but the king."
4756,211-122425-0045.flac," and as dartanian stood firm, it was his adversary who made the retreating step. but dartanian seized the moment at which, in this movement, the sort of burnigeau deviated from the line. he freed his weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder."
4757,211-122425-0024.flac," he who wounded juzak cried the king, he a boy."
4758,211-122425-0004.flac," and by and by, by and by, we will see. ah, sire, it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty."
4759,211-122425-0022.flac," that is true, sire. there can be no more doubt on that head. they called upon him then to retire, but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart, entirely devoted to your majesty."
4760,211-122425-0006.flac, lavueville said he'd take my place.
4761,211-122425-0067.flac," but on the contrary, for him, whose people the musketeers had assaulted, and whose hotel they had endeavored to burn. now, as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time, each becoming naturally, more firm in his own opinion,"
4762,211-122425-0068.flac," he repaired therefore, immediately to his hotel, and cost himself to be announced. the two nobles saluted each other politely. for if no friendship existed between them, there was at least a steam. both were men of courage and honor."
4763,211-122425-0027.flac," that is true, said the king, but never mind to reveal, come still by the back staircase. to reveal smiled. but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master,"
4764,211-122425-0017.flac," and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinals' guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth. why, this is a victory cried the king, all radiant, a complete victory!"
4765,211-122425-0005.flac," the king therefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket."
4766,211-122425-0064.flac, everyone to return home and wait for news.
4767,211-122425-0028.flac," he saluted the king respectfully, and with this agreement took leave of him. that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them. as they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not much excited."
4768,211-122425-0010.flac," had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gaskany, whom i had introduced to them the same morning. the party was to take place at saint germain, i believe, and they had appointed to meet at the carm des show, where they were disturbed by desjusac, caihousac,"
4769,211-122425-0018.flac," one hardly a young man, but who, however, behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty. how does he call himself? dartanian sire."
4770,211-122425-0015.flac," but i will not swear to its sire. you know how difficult it is to discover the truth, and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct,"
4771,211-122425-0037.flac, look at me as long as you like my little gentleman. i have said what i have said.
4772,211-122425-0046.flac, and who's servicing had a relative.
4773,211-122425-0043.flac, bernicello was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice. in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom
4774,211-122425-0032.flac," although he played with his left hand, he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow such exertion."
4775,211-122425-0031.flac," and although ignorant of the game which he had never played, he accepted, not knowing what to do at this time from 9 o'clock in the morning as it then scarcely was, till 12. the two musketeers were already there and were playing together."
4776,211-122425-0035.flac," his audience would have been probably lost, as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king. now, as upon this audience and his guest-gone imagination depended his future life, he saluted aramus and porto's politely,"
4777,211-122425-0021.flac, he was dressed as a citizen. the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked. so you may plainly see trvill interrupted the king. it was they who attacked.
4778,211-122425-0039.flac," lest it be observed that we go out together, you must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be in the way. that's true, said the guardsman, astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man."
4779,211-122425-0056.flac," they succeeded in calming their friends who continued themselves, with hurling some paving stones against the gates. but the gates were too strong. they soon tired of this sport. besides, those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group, and were making their way."
4780,211-122425-0063.flac," gentlemen, i will say the king this evening, but as to you, i do not advise you to risk doing so."" this advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it."
4781,211-122425-0000.flac, do you know that his imminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers?
4782,211-122425-0060.flac," directed his course toward the louvre. but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers, he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of saint germain."
4783,211-122425-0062.flac," the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag, at first the king answered that he would not go, but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner. and the king has seen the carnal?"
4784,211-122425-0033.flac," and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly, they only continued giving balls to one another without counting."
4785,211-122425-0048.flac," and the moment the two guards were attacked, their young companion drove them back. burnageon now fell, and as the guardsmen were only two against four, they began to cry. to the rescue,"
4786,211-122425-0020.flac," placing his hand upon his hip. sire resumed treville, as i told you."
4787,211-122425-0052.flac," who hastened to this decor of their comrades. the melee became general, but strength was on the side of the musketeers."
4788,211-122425-0014.flac," are the natural enemies of the cardsmen who belonged to the cardinal. yes, trivial yes, said the king in a melon-colleatome. and it is very sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in france, two heads to royalty."
4789,211-122425-0002.flac," i'll be there warranty, and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards, but in your majesty's service. but what are they to do?"
4790,211-122425-0042.flac," never mind, be content, i will do my best, on guard."" but, said he whom dartenian thus provoked, it appears to me that this place is badly chosen, and that we should be better,"
4791,211-122425-0038.flac," you're in the wrong there. for if you knew my name, perhaps you would not be so pressing. what is your name?"
4792,211-122425-0036.flac, declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with him on more equal terms.
4793,211-122425-0016.flac," you are right, trivill, but they were not alone your musketeers. they had a youth with them. yes, sire, and one wounded man, so that three of the king's musketeers, one of whom was wounded,"
4794,211-122425-0003.flac," would not once say he was speaking of a religious community, and truth my dear captain,"
4795,211-122425-0026.flac," it is useless to let the cardinal know. yes, sire. you understand, sravil, an edict, a still and an edict. it is forbidden to fight, after all. but this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel. it is a brawl."
4796,211-122425-0047.flac," and pressing him warmly, without doubt, would soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the friends of the guardsmen who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d'artagnan, rushed, sword-enhanced from the court, and fell upon the conqueror."
4797,211-122425-0034.flac, passed so close to dartinian's face.
4798,211-122425-0011.flac," who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts. ah, you incline me to think so, said the king. there is no doubt they went there to fight themselves. i do not accuse them, sire."
4799,211-122425-0050.flac," to his eminence. thus the soldiers of other companies, then those which belonged to the red duke, as aramus had called him, often took part with the king's musketeers in these quarrels."
4800,211-122425-0025.flac," it is, as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty. jusak, one of the first thordsmen in the kingdom, will sigh for once he found his master. i will see this young man, terville. i will see him, and if anything can be done,"
4801,211-122425-0058.flac, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal.
4802,211-122425-0059.flac, and the two will path off together.
4803,211-122425-0057.flac," who was waiting for them, already informed of this fresh disturbance."
4804,211-122425-0019.flac," he is the son of one of my oldest friends, the son of a man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory in the civil war. and you say this young man behaved himself well, tell me how, treville, you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting."
4805,211-122425-0008.flac," guess-sire as they always do. and how did the thing happen? let us see for you know, my dear captain, a judge must hear both sides. good lord, in the most simple and natural manner possible,"
4806,211-122425-0049.flac," at these cries, all who were in the hotel rushed out and fell upon the four companions, who, on their side, cried aloud, to the rescue musketeers. this cry was generally heated."
4807,211-122425-0066.flac, who's relative as we already know. burn is jo was.
4808,211-122425-0054.flac," the excitement was that it's hide among the musketeers and their allies, and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hotel."
4809,211-122425-0023.flac," brave young man murmured the king. well, he did remain with him, and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave zhuzak the terrible sword thrust, which has made the cardinals so angry."
4810,211-122425-0012.flac," but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do. in such a deserted place as the neighborhood,"
4811,211-122425-0051.flac, to the rescue musketeers to the rescue.
4812,211-122425-0029.flac, but dartanian with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams.
4813,211-122425-0055.flac," to mestix and daring to make a sortie upon the king's musketeers. the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm, unfortunately, 11 o'clock struck."
4814,211-122425-0053.flac," the doors of which they close just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them. as to the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and as we have said in a very bad state."

4820,3235-11599-0026.flac," or of 2 and 3, sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition. while the 7-beat measure is taken in groups of 4 and 3, or of 3 and 4."
4821,3235-11599-0023.flac, it will be noted that the two measures
4822,3235-11599-0002.flac, measures are similarly accented groups of evenly spaced beats. each group having at least one accented and one non-accented beat. the strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure.
4823,3235-11599-0025.flac," quintouple, 5-beat, and septouple, 7-beat measures are occasionally met with, but these are rare and will always be sporadic. the 5-beat measure is taken as a combination of 3 and 2."

4829,3235-11599-0016.flac, there is thus seem to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words simple and compound when applied in this connection. the principal question at issue being whether 4-beat measure is an individual variety?

4940,39-121915-0012.flac," where most of his leisure days were spent, and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away. he had, by that time, realized an easy competence,"
4941,39-121915-0018.flac," but it was not in mr. weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and as he believed so deservedly dear, he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him."
4942,39-121915-0027.flac, and had sense and energy in spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations. and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randles from hartfield.
4943,39-121915-0014.flac," and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition. it was now sometimes since his tailor had begun to influence his schemes, but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,"
4944,39-121915-0025.flac," in every expression of congratulation, which her marriage had already secured. she felt herself a most fortunate woman, and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought."
4945,39-121915-0006.flac," she had not the best. she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger."
4946,39-121915-0015.flac," till they were accomplished. he had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife, and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through."
4947,39-121915-0009.flac," and mr. and mrs. churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her deceased."
4948,39-121915-0030.flac," taylor, when they left her at randalls in the center of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own."
4949,39-121915-0016.flac," he had never been an unhappy man. his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage. but a second must show him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be."
4950,39-121915-0028.flac," her situation was all together the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs. weston and of moments only of regret in her satisfaction, her more than satisfaction, her cheerful enjoyment was so just"
4951,39-121915-0010.flac, and he had only his own comfort to seek in his own situation to improve as he could. a complete change of life became desirable. he quitted the militia and engaged in trade.
4952,39-121915-0011.flac," having brothers already established in a good way in london, which afforded him a favourable opening. it was a concern which brought just employment enough. he had still a small house in library."
4953,39-121915-0020.flac, but never achieved. now upon his father's marriage it was very generally proposed as the most proper attention.
4954,39-121915-0031.flac," but never did she go without mr. woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, ah, poor miss taylor, she would be very glad to stay."
4955,39-121915-0021.flac," either when mrs. perry drank tea with mrs. and mrs. bates, or when mrs. and mrs. bates returned the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchill to come among them, and the hopes strengthened"
4956,39-121915-0023.flac, i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr. frank churchill has written to mrs. weston.
4957,39-121915-0029.flac," and so apparent that emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprise."
4958,39-121915-0007.flac, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.
4959,39-121915-0032.flac," there was no recovering miss taylor, nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her, but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr. woodhouse. the compliments of his neighbors were over."
4960,39-121915-0024.flac," mrs. weston had, of course, formed a very favorable idea of the young men, and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense."
4961,39-121915-0026.flac, but dear emma was of no feeble character.
4962,39-121915-0002.flac," and miss churchill fell in love with him. nobody was surprised except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connection would offend."
4963,39-121915-0019.flac, mr. frank churchill was one of the boasts of hybury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed.
4964,39-121915-0000.flac," but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind,"
4965,39-121915-0033.flac," but still the cake was eaten, and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone."
4966,39-121914-0008.flac," the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day. she recalled her past kindness, the kindness, the affection of sixteen years, how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old."
4967,39-121914-0016.flac," and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time. her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,"
4968,39-121914-0014.flac," rational or playful. the evil of the actual disparity in their ages, and mr. woodhouse had not married early, was much increased by his constitution and habits."
4969,39-121914-0002.flac," the real evils, indeed, of emma's situation, were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself."
4970,39-121914-0000.flac," emma woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence."
4971,39-121914-0044.flac," mr. weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone, if he did not like it. oh, no! mr. weston certainly would never marry again. some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed."
4972,39-121914-0021.flac," when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor, too, and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done,"
4973,39-121914-0011.flac," which had soon followed isabella's marriage, on mare being left to each other, was yet a dear, tender, recollection. she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed, intelligent,"
4974,39-121914-0006.flac," the event had every promise of happiness for her friend. mr. weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners."
4975,39-121914-0036.flac," it must be better to have only one to please than two. especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature."
4976,39-121914-0054.flac," and this is the only way i have of doing him a service. mr. elton is a very pretty young man to be sure, and a very good young man, and i have a great regard for him. but if you want to show him any attention, my dear,"
4977,39-121914-0045.flac," and others of the sun and the uncle not letting him. all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but i believed none of it. ever since the day about four years ago,"
4978,39-121914-0053.flac," that it would be ashamed to have him single any longer. and i thought when he was joining their hands today, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him. i think very well of mr. elton."
4979,39-121914-0004.flac," sorro came, a gentle sorrow, but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness. miss taylor married. it was miss taylor's loss, which first brought grief."
4980,39-121914-0033.flac," i wish you may not catch cold. dirty sir, look at my shoes, not a speck on them."
4981,39-121914-0027.flac, i am sure she will be an excellent servant.
4982,39-121914-0043.flac," and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful."
4983,39-121914-0039.flac," it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion,"" said mr. knightley. we should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it. but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor's advantage."
4984,39-121914-0056.flac, i dare say mr. knightley will be so kind as to meet him.
4985,39-121914-0048.flac," you're making the match, as you call it, means only you're planning it. you're saying to yourself one idle day, i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor, if mr. weston were to marry her."
4986,39-121914-0032.flac," mr. knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good, and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily. when this was over, mr. woodhouse gratefully observed,"
4987,39-121914-0037.flac, i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome. my dearest papa!
4988,39-121914-0051.flac," understanding but in part. but my dear, pray, do not make any more matches. they are silly things and break up one's family circle grievously."
4989,39-121914-0030.flac," was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it. as the elder brother of isabella's husband, he lived about a mile from highbury,"
4990,39-121914-0012.flac," well informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly, interested in herself in every pleasure, every scheme of hers."
4991,39-121914-0007.flac," and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match. but it was a black morning's work for her."
4992,39-121914-0049.flac, and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess? i pity you. i thought you cleverer. for to pen upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. there is always some talent in it.
4993,39-121914-0001.flac," very fond of both daughters, but particularly of emma."
4994,39-121914-0028.flac," he will be able to tell her how we all are. emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped by the help of batkemen to get her father tolerably through the evening."
4995,39-121914-0005.flac," it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. the wedding over and the bright people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together."
4996,39-121914-0047.flac," if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage, a worthy employment for a young lady's mind."
4997,39-121914-0052.flac," poor mr. elton, you like mr. elton, papa? i must look about for a wife for him. there is nobody in highbury who deserves him, and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably."
4998,39-121914-0017.flac, being settled in london only 16 miles off was much beyond her daily reach.
4999,39-121914-0009.flac, how she had devoted all her powers.
5000,39-121914-0035.flac," poor mr. and miss woodhouse, if you please, but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor. i have a great regard for you and emma, but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence, at any rate?"
5001,39-121914-0034.flac," i have been in no hurry with my congratulations, but i hope it all went off tolerably well. how did you all behave? who cried most? ah, poor miss taylor, tis a sad business."
5002,39-121914-0019.flac," but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day. it was a melancholy change, and emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things to their father a woke,"
5003,39-121914-0018.flac," through at hartfield. before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband,"
5004,39-121914-0041.flac," and a very considerable one, that i made the match myself. i made the match you know four years ago, and to have it take place and be proved in the right,"
5005,39-121914-0046.flac," and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer-mitchell's. i made up my mind on the subject. i planned the match from that hour, and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa,"
5006,39-121914-0042.flac," may comfort me for anything."" mr. knightley shook his head at her. her father fondly replied, ""'ahh, my dear, i wish you would not make matches and for tell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass."
5007,39-121914-0031.flac," was a frequent visitor and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual is coming directly from their mutual connections in london. he had returned to a late dinner."
5008,39-121914-0023.flac," but when t. came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner. poor miss taylor! i wish you were here again. what a pity it is that mr. weston ever thought of her."
5009,39-121914-0038.flac," what a horrible idea! oh no! i meant only myself! mr. knightley loves to find fault with me, you know. in a joke, it's all a joke."
5010,39-121914-0013.flac," only half a mile from them, and a mistaler in the house. and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. she dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her."
5011,39-121914-0055.flac, ask him to come and dine with us someday.
5012,39-121914-0015.flac, for having been a valetudeinarian all his life without activity of mind or body.
5013,39-121914-0025.flac, you know we have settled all that already.
5014,39-121914-0050.flac," an irrational, unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns. you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference."
5015,39-121914-0003.flac," these were the disadvantages which threatened a loy to her many enjoyments. the danger, however, was that present so unperceived"
5016,39-121914-0029.flac," and be attacked by no regrets but her own. the back amon table was placed, but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary. mr. knightley, a sensible man, about seven or eight in thirty,"
5017,39-121914-0022.flac, is sad a thing for herself as for them. and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield. emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts.
5018,39-121914-0040.flac," she knows how very acceptable it must be, at miss taylor's time of life to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision."
5019,39-121914-0020.flac," matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable, and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection."
5020,39-121914-0026.flac," that was your doing, papa. you got hannah that good place. nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her. james is so obliged to you. i am very glad i did think of her."
5021,39-121914-0024.flac," and bear all my odd humors when she might have a house of her own. a house of her own, but what is the advantage of a house of her own? this is three times as large, and you have never any odd humors, my dear."""
5022,39-121914-0010.flac," and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. a large debt of gratitude was owing here, but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve,"
5023,39-121916-0004.flac," and mrs. godard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that mr. woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses."
5024,39-121916-0014.flac," to be allowed to bring miss smith with her, a most welcome request. for miss smith was a girl of seventeen who emma knew very well by sight and had long felt and interested in account of her beauty."
5025,39-121916-0030.flac," what say you to half a glass of wine? a small half glass, put into a tumbler of water? i do not think it could disagree with you. emma allowed her father to talk, but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style,"
5026,39-121916-0009.flac," and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and in divinity, but a real, honest, old-fashioned boarding school, where reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,"
5027,39-121916-0017.flac," and quite determined to continue the acquaintance. she was not struck by anything remarkably clever in miss smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging, not inconveniently shy,"
5028,39-121916-0006.flac," she loved everybody. was interested in everybody's happiness, quick-sighted to everybody's merits, thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother."
5029,39-121916-0025.flac, he loved to have the cloth laid.
5030,39-121916-0005.flac," for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favor, and she had no intellectual superiority to make a tonement to herself."
5031,39-121916-0018.flac," not unwilling to talk, and yet so far from pushing, showing so proper, and becoming a deference. seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield,"
5032,39-121916-0012.flac," it was no remedy for the absence of mrs. weston. she was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well."
5033,39-121916-0001.flac, he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked. he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle. his horror of late hours and large dinner parties
5034,39-121916-0000.flac," mr. woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. he liked very much to have his friends come and see him, and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield, and his good nature from his fortune, his house, and his daughter,"
5035,39-121916-0002.flac," and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him. real, long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley."
5036,39-121916-0008.flac," and a mine of felicity to herself. she was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited mr. woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip. mrs. g'dard was the mistress of a school."
5037,39-121916-0024.flac," which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing everything well and attentively. with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honors of the meal?"
5038,39-121916-0029.flac," i would not recommend an egg boiled by anybody else, but you need not be afraid they are very small. you see, one of our small eggs will not hurt you."
5039,39-121916-0031.flac, and on the present evening head particular pleasure in sending them away happy.
5040,39-121916-0011.flac," hung around with fancy work whenever she could, and when or lose a few six-penses by his fireside. these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect,"
5041,39-121916-0026.flac, and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to everything.
5042,39-121916-0027.flac," such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation recommend, though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say."
5043,39-121916-0015.flac," a very gracious invitation was returned in the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion. harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody. somebody had placed her several years back at mrs. goodard's school,"
5044,39-121916-0022.flac," she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate, and the supper table which"
5045,39-121916-0023.flac," always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware. with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit,"
5046,39-121916-0021.flac," she would form her opinions and her manners. it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking, highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure and powers."
5047,39-121916-0016.flac," she was short, plump and fair, with a fine blue, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness. and before the end of the evening, emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person."
5048,39-121916-0013.flac," but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated. as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day,"
5049,39-121916-0019.flac," and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of everything in so superior a style to which she had been used to, that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement. encouragement should be given."
5050,39-121916-0028.flac," mrs. bates, let me propose you're venturing on one of these eggs. an egg boiled very soft is not unholy some."
5051,39-121916-0020.flac," though soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of high-bery in its connections, the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her."
5052,39-121916-0010.flac," for hybury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot. she had an ample house in garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,"
5053,39-121916-0003.flac," and by mr. elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegance, seas, and society of mr. woodhouse's drawing room."
5054,39-121916-0007.flac," and so many good neighbors and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and graceful spirit, were a recommendation to everybody."
5055,3879-173592-0020.flac," and his tribesmen robbed and maltreated by the lawless soldiers exalted in the miseries. yet in these, their dark and subtle neighbours was their only hope."
5056,3879-173592-0043.flac, waited two days and then descended the river with his prisoner.
5057,3879-173592-0024.flac," they were lamentably unfit for the work they had taken in hand. our misery, says laubonnier, was so great that one was found that gathered up all the fishbones that he could find which he dried"
5058,3879-173592-0018.flac," and now, in ample measure, the french began to reap the harvest of their folly. conquest, gold, and military occupation had alone been their aims."
5059,3879-173592-0040.flac," those who could bear the weight of their armour put it on embarked to the number of fifty in two barges and sailed up the river under lodonia himself. having reached uttinas landing, they marched inland and entered his village."
5060,3879-173592-0010.flac," the name of the tribe is preserved in that of the river kabusa. in close league with him was the mighty oethkākwa, dwelling near cape canaveral, who gave his daughter a maiden of wondrous beauty,"
5061,3879-173592-0005.flac," married his daughter and, in his absence, reigned in his stead. but as his sway verged towards despotism, his subjects took offence and split his head with a hatchet. during the winter,"
5062,3879-173592-0029.flac," could their eyes have pieced the future. the indians had left the neighbourhood, but from time to time brought in meager supplies of fish, which they sold to the famished soldiers at exorbitant prices."
5063,3879-173592-0015.flac," with thrice the force demanded. 300, thierna goa's and 30 frenchmen took up their march through the pine barons. uttinas conjure was of the number and had well-known the enterprise."
5064,3879-173592-0036.flac," the maids began to ripen, and this brought some relief, but the indians, exasperated and greedy, sold it with reluctance, and murdered two half-famished frenchmen who gathered a handful in the fields."
5065,3879-173592-0033.flac," the spring wore away and no relief appeared. one thought now engrossed the colonists that have returned to france. vassurship, the breton, still remained in the river."
5066,3879-173592-0012.flac," in the midst of a lake, who put the warriors to flight, bore the maidens captive to their watery fastness, espoused them all, and we are assured."
5067,3879-173592-0017.flac," panic, slaughter, and a plentiful harvest of scalps. but no persuasion could induce othina to follow up his victory. he went home to dance round his trophies, and the french returned disgusted to fort caroline."
5068,3879-173592-0038.flac," and sent back empty handed and half-starved. they returned to the fort in the words of lord dhanier, angry and prickly to the quick for being so mocked."
5069,3879-173592-0039.flac," and joined by all the comrades fiercely demanded to be led against uttina to seize him, punish his insolence, and extort from his fears the supplies which could not be looked for from his gratitude. the commandant was forced to comply."
5070,3879-173592-0042.flac," uttered moans and outcries from the strand. yet no ransom was offered, since reasoning from their own instincts, they never doubted that, after the price was paid, the captive would be put to death."
5071,3879-173592-0021.flac," the third anniversary of the day when rebo and his companions, full of delighted anticipation, had first explored."
5072,3879-173592-0004.flac," and was now a soldier under lord donnier. the latter gave him leave to trade with the indians, a privilege which he used so well that he grew which, with his traffic, became prime favorite with the chief of the island of edelano,"
5073,3879-173592-0041.flac," surrounded his mud-plasted palace, seized him amid the yells and howlings of his subjects, and led him prisoner to their boats. here anchored in midstream,"
5074,3879-173592-0034.flac, and they had also the spanish brighantine brought by the moutaniers. but these vessels were insufficient and they prepared to build a new one. the energy of reviving hope lent new life to their exhausted frames.
5075,3879-173592-0009.flac, to hold converse in secret with supernal or infernal powers. and each year he sacrificed to his gods one of the spaniards whom the fortune of the sea had cast upon his shores.
5076,3879-173592-0023.flac," some were digging roots in the forest, or gathering a kind of sorrel upon the meadows. if they had had any skill in hunting and fishing, the river and the woods would have supplied their needs, but in this point as in others,"
5077,3879-173592-0014.flac," again, alluring his greedy allies by the assurance that thus reinforced, he would conquer for them a free access to the phantom gold mines of appalach. ottini set forth on his fools errand,"
5078,3879-173592-0025.flac," and beat into powder to make bread thereof. the effects of this hideous famine appeared incontainately among us. for our bones, ift soon began to cleave, so near onto the skin."
5079,3879-173592-0016.flac," with hideous grimaces, howlings and contortions, he wrought himself into a prophetic frenzy, and proclaimed to the astounded warriors"
5080,3879-173592-0027.flac," to describe the anxiously expected sale. had collignee left them to perish, or had some new tempest of calamity let loose upon france, drown the memory of their exile?"
5081,3879-173592-0000.flac," segesius, bold and restless, he pushed his way from town to town and pretended to have reached the mysterious mountains of appalach. he sent to the fort mantles woven with feathers, quivers covered with choice fur."
5082,3879-173592-0019.flac," not a rod of ground had been stirred with the spade. their stores were consumed, and the expected supplies had not come. the indians too were hostile. saturiana hated them as allies of his enemies."
5083,3879-173592-0031.flac," beyond gunshot, waiting for their customers to come out to them. «often times», says lodonia, «our poor soldiers were constrained to give away the very shirts from their backs, to get one fish. if at any time they shoot unto the savages,"
5084,3879-173592-0008.flac," filled with treasure gathered from spanish wrecks on adjacent reefs and keys. the monarch was a priest, too, and a magician, with power over the elements. each year he withdrew from the public gaze"
5085,3879-173592-0030.flac," lest they should pay the penalty of their extortion, they would not enter the fort."
5086,3879-173592-0011.flac," and marriage to his great ally. but as the bride, with her bridesmaid, was journeying towards carlos, escorted by a chosen band, they were assailed by a wild and warlike race, inhabitants of an island called"
5087,3879-173592-0001.flac," arrows tipped with gold, wedges of a green stone like barrel or emerald, and other trophies of his wanderings. a gentleman named grotto took up the quest and penetrated to the dominions of hostakwa."
5088,3879-173592-0026.flac," that most part of the soldiers had their skinned pierced thorough with them in many parts of their bodies. yet giddy with weakness, they dragged themselves in turn to the top of st john's bluff, straining their eyes across the sea,"
5089,3879-173592-0022.flac," for within the precinct of fort caroline a homesick, squalid band, dejected in worn, dragged their shrunken limbs about the sun scorched area, or lay stretched in listless wretchedness under the shade of the barracks."
5090,3879-173592-0003.flac," a humbler adventure was pierre gambie, a robust and daring youth."
5091,3879-173592-0032.flac," the excessive price which they took, these villains would answer them roughly and cheerleashly. if thou make so great account of thy marchandise, eat it and we will eat our fish. then fell thee out a laughing and mocked us with open throat."
5092,3879-173592-0006.flac," indians from the neighbourhood of cape canaveral brought to the fort two spaniards, wrecked 15 years before on the southwestern extremity of the peninsula."
5093,3879-173592-0013.flac, begged for ten archibusiers to aid him on a new raid.
5094,3879-173592-0037.flac," one asdinā, the plunder of whose villages would yield an ample supply. the offer was accepted. othinī and vasu set out, but were grossly deceived, led against a different enemy"
5095,3879-173592-0007.flac," they told of the king of caps, on whose domains they had been wrecked, achieved mighty in stature and in power. in one of his villages was a pit, six feet deep and as wide as a hog's head."
5096,3879-173592-0028.flac, in vain the watchman on the hill surveyed the solitude of waters. a deep deduction fell upon them.
5097,3879-173592-0002.flac," who it was pretended could muster three or four thousand warriors, and who promised, with the aid of a hundred archibusiers, to conquer all the kings of the adjacent mountains, and subject them and their gold mines to the rule of the french."
5098,3879-173592-0035.flac," some gathered pitch in the pine forests, some made charcoal,"
5099,3879-174923-0007.flac," so you're at the old game, mr finn,"" said his landlord. yes, at the old game, i suppose it's the same with you. now mr. buntz had been a very violent politician."
5100,3879-174923-0006.flac," he would not even endeavour to think how he might, in such case, best bestow himself. for the present he would remain within the region of politics and live as near as he could to the world of the wheel of which the sound was so dear to him."
5101,3879-174923-0034.flac," but the ground for that was gone, and mrs. lo was no longer painfully severe. a few words were said as to his great loss. mrs. lo once raised her eyebrows in pretended surprise"
5102,3879-174923-0046.flac," poor mrs. low, we can foresee that there is much grief in store for her, and some rocks ahead too in the political career of her husband. finneas was still in london hanging about the clubs doing nothing."
5103,3879-174923-0003.flac," but unfortunately, the judge by whom all this would be decided might not reach tank avill in his travels till after christmas. perhaps not till after easter. and in the meantime, what should he do with himself?"
5104,3879-174923-0054.flac," but of her inside life, of her baby, or of her husband as a husband, she never says a word. you will have seen it all, and have enough of the feminine side of a man's character to be able to tell me how they are living."
5105,3879-174923-0014.flac," just as the theatres are mr finn or the gin shops. then i know there's a deal more to be done before honest men can come by their own. you're right enough mr finn, you are as far as churches go, and you was right too when you cut and run off the treasury bench."
5106,3879-174923-0060.flac," or to remain here by myself, but he will consent to neither. in truth the burden of idleness has now fallen upon him so heavily that he cannot shake it off. he dreads that he may be called upon to do anything."
5107,3879-174923-0015.flac," i never expected this, but i'll do for you, mr. finn, just as i ever did in the old days, and it was i that was sorry when i heard of the poor young lady's death. so i was, mr. finn. well, then i won't mention a name ever again."
5108,3879-174923-0027.flac," he had left all those things of his own free will, as though telling himself that there was a better life than they offered to him. but was he sure that he had found it to be better? he had certainly sied for the gods which he had left."
5109,3879-174923-0023.flac," alas, alas, how soon might he now require that monylender's services? and then he recollected how he had left these rooms to go into others, grander and more appropriate to his life when he had filled high office under the state."
5110,3879-174923-0055.flac," i'm sure they are happy together, because violet has more common sense than any woman i ever knew. and pray, tell me about the afferate tankville. my cousin, barrington, writes me word that you will certainly get the seed."
5111,3879-174923-0051.flac, assume that they have at last got a person to do a duty which has always hitherto been neglected. violet does right.
5112,3879-174923-0025.flac, when the point of his knife had been withdrawn. would he be able to insert the point again between those two difficult shells? would the countess as once more be kind to him? would drawing rooms be open to him and sometimes open to him and to no other?
5113,3879-174923-0038.flac," you don't mean that i am guilty of throwing the first stone, said vineas. they have been throwing stones at the temple since first it was built,"" said mrs. low with energy, but they have fallen off its polished shafts in dust and fragment."
5114,3879-174923-0021.flac," which he used to know so well, a hundred memories of former days crowded back upon him. lord chiltern, for a few months, had lived with him, and then there had a prisoner quarrel, which he had for a time thought would dissolve his old life into ruin."
5115,3879-174923-0065.flac," i complain of no injustice, our castle was built upon the sand. why should mr. kennedy have been a cabinet minister, and why should i have been a wife?"
5116,3879-174923-0036.flac," and if her husband could not be said to live by means of the same atmosphere, it was because the breath of his nostrils had been drawn chiefly in the vice-chancellor's court in lincoln's inn. but he, no doubt,"
5117,3879-174923-0001.flac," it would cost but little. and that little, should he be successful, would fall on the shoulders of mr. brobera. should he knock off eight votes and lose none himself, he would be member for tankerville."
5118,3879-174923-0042.flac," it would be my business to do so, but i'm not a priest."" mr. low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine, and in all friendly observances treated him with due affection. but neither did he nor did his wife."
5119,3879-174923-0029.flac," with the countess's cards be showered upon him again. one card, or rather note, had reached him while he was yet at tankville, reminding him of old days. it was from mrs. low, the wife of the barrister."
5120,3879-174923-0032.flac," phineas could not keep himself from feeling that mrs. lowe intended to triumph over him. but nevertheless, he accepted the invitation. they were very glad to see him, explaining that"
5121,3879-174923-0069.flac," dance ought to weigh upon me. he has never even told me that he loves me, but he is persistent in declaring that those whom god has joined together nothing human should separate."
5122,3879-174923-0002.flac," he knew that many votes had been given for broborra, which, if the truth were known of them, would be knocked off. and he did not know that the same could be said of any one of those by which he had been supported."
5123,3879-174923-0008.flac," pretty much the same, mr finn. i don't see that things are much better than they used to be. they tell me at the people's banner, office, that the lords have had as much to do with this election, as with any that ever went before it."
5124,3879-174923-0000.flac," that he should be elected. and now he did think it probable that he should get the seat on a petition. a scrutiny used to be a very expensive business, but under the existing law, made as the scrutiny would be in the burrow itself,"
5125,3879-174923-0044.flac," she might have been less loud in expressing her abhorrence of the enemies of the church. if she feared nothing, why should she scream so loudly? between the two, he was a good deal crushed and confounded."
5126,3879-174923-0043.flac," for a moment abstain from attacking their guests in respect to his speeches at tankerville. it seemed indeed, to finneas, that as mrs. lo was buckled up in such triple armor that she feared nothing,"
5127,3879-174923-0050.flac," and when i hear of you at harrington hall, i know that you are on your way to the other things. do tell me what life is like with oswald and violet. of course he never writes. he is one of those men who, on marrying,"
5128,3879-174923-0061.flac," to me, it is all one tragedy. i cannot but think of things as they were two or three years since. my father and my husband were both in the cabinet, and you, young as you were, stood but one step below it. oswald was out in the cold. he was very poor."
5129,3879-174923-0016.flac," but after all there's been bitwicks due and us, it wouldn't be natural to pass it by without one word, would it, mr finn? well, yes, he's just the same man as ever."
5130,3879-174923-0013.flac, the money would come to us to do as we pleased with it. we proved all that when we paired them down a bit. what's an ecclesiastical commission? only another name for a box to put the money into till you want to take it out again.
5131,3879-174923-0067.flac," for the gloom of his life. i suppose that he lives exclusively at l'occlinta. from time to time, i am ploured by him to return to my duty beneath his roof. he grounds his demand on no affection of his own,"
5132,3879-174923-0035.flac," when phineas explained that he had thrown up his place, and then they settled down on the question of the day. and so, said mrs. lowe, you've begun to attack the church. it must be remembered that at this moment mr. dobinny"
5133,3879-174923-0040.flac," you haven't thrown the first stone, said mr. lo, but you have taken up the throwing at the first moment in which stones may be dangerous. no stones can be dangerous,"" said mr. lo."
5134,3879-174923-0072.flac," though he complained. in march, move down south for a couple of months. do come if you can. most sincerely yours, laura kennedy."
5135,3879-174923-0045.flac, mrs. low was very triumphant when she allowed him to escape from her hounds at ten o'clock. but at that moment nothing had yet been heard in baker street of mr. dobinny's proposition to the electors of east barsetshire.
5136,3879-174923-0026.flac," then he thought of certain special drawing rooms in which wonderful things had been said to him. since that he had been a married man, and those special drawing rooms and those wonderful words had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife."
5137,3879-174923-0004.flac," as for going back to dublin, that was now out of the question. he had entered upon a feverish state of existence in which it was impossible that he should live in ireland."
5138,3879-174923-0020.flac," and keeps himself, but he don't bring him as money, nor yet it can't be expected, mr. finn. i know what the youngins will do and what they won't. and mary jane is quite handy about the house now, and she do break things."
5139,3879-174923-0005.flac, he must vanish out of the world.
5140,3879-174923-0033.flac," as nobody was supposed to be in town, nobody had been asked to meet him. in former days he had been very intimate in that house, having received from both of them much kindness, mingled perhaps with some touch of severity on the part of the lady."
5141,3879-174923-0064.flac," he won his wife honestly, did he not? and he has ever been honest. it is my pride to think i never gave him up, but the bitter part of my cup consists in this, that as he has won what he has deserved, so have we."
5142,3879-174923-0068.flac," on no presumption that any affection can remain with me. he says no word of happiness, he offers no comfort, he does not attempt to persuade with promises of future care. he makes his claim simply on holy writ, and on the feeling of duty which"
5143,3879-174923-0028.flac," while his young wife was living, he had kept his size down so that she should not hear them. but he had been forced to acknowledge that his new life had been vapid and flavorless. now he had been tempted back again to the old haunts."
5144,3879-174923-0071.flac," to be able to talk again to one who knows all the errors and all the efforts of my past life as you do. dresden is very cold in the winter. i did not know whether you would mind that. we are very particular about the rooms, but my father bears the temperature wonderfully well."
5145,3879-174923-0052.flac, as the wife of a master of hound.
5146,3879-174923-0057.flac, we certainly did not think that you would come out strong against the church.
5147,3879-174923-0047.flac," discussing mr. dobinny's wonderful treachery with such men as came up to town, and waiting for the meeting of parliament when he received the following letter from lady laura kennedy. dresden november 18th"
5148,3879-174923-0018.flac," that i don't know how to bear it. well, yes, that is true, mr finn, then never was a man better at bringing home his money to his wife than bunce."
5149,3879-174923-0058.flac," but if it must come, why not by your hands as well as by any other? it is hardly possible that you in your heart should love a protestant ascendant church. but as barrington says, a horse won't get oats,"
5150,3879-174923-0039.flac," i'm afraid that mrs. low, when she allowed herself to speak thus energetically, entertain some confused idea that the church of england and the christian religion were one and the same thing, or at least that they had been brought into the world together."
5151,3879-174923-0012.flac," but when we read of churches, as is called state churches, churches as have bishops, you and i have to pay for as never goes into them. but we don't pay the bishops, mr. bons. oh, yes we do, because if they wasn't paid,"
5152,3879-174923-0010.flac, not but what he's disgraced himself by what he's been and done now. mr. slide in former days had been the editor of the people's banner.
5153,3879-174923-0009.flac, perhaps they don't know much about it at the people's banner office. i thought mr slide and the people's banner had gone over to the other side-bunts. mr slide is pretty wide awake whatever side he's on.
5154,3879-174923-0049.flac," than that you should be living in dublin. i cannot conceive of you as living any other life than that of the house of commons, downing street and the clubs. nor do i wish to do so."
5155,3879-174923-0062.flac," papa thought all evil of him. violet had refused him over and over again. he quarreled with you and all the world seemed against him. then of a sudden you vanished, and we vanished. an ineffable misery fell upon me, and upon my wretched husband."
5156,3879-174923-0022.flac," now lord chilton was again his very intimate friend, and there had used to sit a needy moneylender, who..."
5157,3879-174923-0059.flac," at home, as you know, not only did he take an active part in politics, but he was active also in the management of his own property. now it seems to him to be almost too great a trouble to write a letter to his steward."
5158,3879-174923-0053.flac, as the artist's real. she told me how poor dear lady bolder communicated to you her unhappiness about her daughter in a manner that made even me laugh and would make thousands laugh in days to come were it ever to be published.
5159,3879-174923-0041.flac," the idea of a state church, said phineas, is opposed to my theory of political progress. what i hope is that my friends will not suppose that i attack the protestant church because i am a roman catholic. if i were a priest,"
5160,3879-174923-0037.flac," would be very much disturbed indeed. should he ever be told that he was required, as an expectant member of mr dobinny's party, to vote for the disestablishment?"
5161,3879-174923-0011.flac," but what a man keeps in the way of religion for his own use is never nothing to me, as what i keep says nothing to him. i'm afraid you don't keep much, mr. bunts. and that's nothing to you, no, there is it, sir. no, indeed."
5162,887-123289-0017.flac," after having risk blowing up during the storm. well, cried the professor, as we have no guns, we cannot hunt. that's all. yes, but how about the instruments? here is the aneroid, the most useful of all."
5163,887-123289-0002.flac," then he returned to the rocks, against which the furious waves were beating, to save what he could. i was unable to speak. i was shattered with fatigue and excitement."
5164,887-123289-0034.flac," well, replied my uncle, we may easily ascertain this by consulting the compass. let us go and see what it says. the professor moved toward the rock upon which hans had laid down the instruments."
5165,887-123289-0006.flac," and that i was only just coming down to breakfast, and that i was to be married to groibind that day? alas, if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east, we should have passed under germany, under my beloved town of hamburg."
5166,887-123289-0025.flac," i don't think we shall come out by the way that we went in."" i stared at the professor with a good deal of mistrust. i asked, was he not touched in the brain? and yet there was method in his madness. and now let us go to breakfast,"" said he."
5167,887-123289-0016.flac," and had saved the most precious of the articles at the risk of his life. not that we had suffered no losses, for instance, our firearms, but we might do without them. our stock of powder had remained un-injured,"
5168,887-123289-0005.flac," the exhilarating voice of the professor fell upon my ears as i awoke. he was ominously cheerful. well, my boy, he cried. have you slept well?"
5169,887-123289-0022.flac," for months cried the professor, we have time to go and to return."
5170,887-123289-0027.flac," after the commotions we had gone through, all contributed to give me a good appetite. whilst breakfasting, i took the opportunity to put to my uncle the question where we were now. that seems to me, i said, rather difficult to make out."
5171,887-123289-0020.flac," there was no denying it. we had all our instruments. as for tools and appliances, there they all lay on the ground. ladders, ropes, picks, spades, etc. still there was the question of provisions to be settled, and i asked,"
5172,887-123289-0015.flac," on my arrival on the shore, i found hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good order. my uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude. this man, with almost superhuman devotion,"
5173,887-123289-0033.flac," perhaps we have deviated. no, i think not."
5174,887-123289-0032.flac," that is a good long way, my friend. but whether we are under turkey or the atlantic depends very much on the question."
5175,887-123289-0000.flac," what happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than i can tell. i felt myself hurled into the waves, and if i escaped from death, and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks,"
5176,887-123289-0007.flac," under the very street where dwelt all that i loved most in the world. then only 40 leagues would have separated us, but they were 40 leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall, and in reality we were a thousand leagues a sunder."
5177,887-123289-0029.flac," the last observation i remarked was made on the island where the geyser was. you mean axel island. don't decline the honor of having given your name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the globe. well, said i."
5178,887-123289-0031.flac," surely, axel, it may vie in size with the mediterranean itself. especially, i replied, if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part, and it is a curious circumstance, i added, that if my computations are right,"
5179,887-123289-0018.flac," and for which i would have given all the others. by means of it, i can calculate the depth and know when we have reached the center."
5180,887-123289-0037.flac," and then turned to me, thunder struck with some unexpected discovery. what is the matter, i asked?"
5181,887-123289-0038.flac," an exclamation of astonishment burst from me. the north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south. it pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea. i shook the box, examined it again."
5182,887-123289-0035.flac," he was gay and full of spirits. he rubbed his hands. he studied his attitudes. i followed him, curious to know if i was right in my estimate. as soon as we had arrived at the rock, my uncle took the compass, laid it horizontally,"
5183,887-123289-0021.flac," how are we off for provisions? the boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore, in a perfect state of preservation. for the most part the sea had spared them, and what with biscuits, salt meat, spirits, and salt fish"
5184,887-123289-0011.flac," i only want to know how that is to be managed. in the simplest way possible, when we have reached the center of the globe, either we shall find some new way to get back, or we shall come back like decent folks the way we came."
5185,887-123289-0028.flac," yes, it is difficult, he said, to calculate exactly. perhaps even impossible, since during these three stormy days i have been unable to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft. but still, we may get an approximation."
5186,887-123289-0023.flac," i awoke by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's ways, if there was always something fresh about him to astonish me."" now, said he."
5187,887-123289-0039.flac," it was in perfect condition. in whatever position i placed the box, the needle pertenaciously returned to this unexpected quarter."
5188,887-123289-0014.flac," we left this grotto which lay open to every wind. at the same time, i cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well. it seemed to me impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have destroyed everything on board."
5189,887-123289-0036.flac," and questioned the needle which, after a few oscillations, presently assumed a fixed position. my uncle looked and looked and looked again. he rubbed his eyes."
5190,887-123289-0019.flac," such high spirits as these were rather too strong. but where is the compass, i asked? here it is, upon this rock, in perfect condition, as well as the thermometers and the chronometer. the hunter is a splendid fellow."
5191,887-123289-0001.flac, it was because the powerful arm of hans came to my rescue. the brave icelander carried me out of the reach of the waves over a burning sand where i found myself by the side of my uncle.
5192,887-123289-0013.flac," yes, to be sure we have. hans is a clever fellow, and i am sure he must have saved a large part of our cargo. but still, let us go and make sure."
5193,887-123289-0010.flac," but, my dear uncle, do let me ask you one question. of course, axel. how about returning? returning? why? you are talking about the return before the arrival. no."
5194,887-123289-0004.flac," the next day, the weather was splendid. the sky and the sea had sunk into sudden repose. every trace of the awful storm had disappeared."
5195,887-123289-0024.flac," therefore, we shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst. as for the raft, i will recommend hans to do his best to repair it, although i don't expect it will be of any further use to us. how so, i cried. an idea of my own, my lad."
5196,887-123289-0009.flac," i am only a little knocked up, but i shall soon be better."" ""'oh,' said my uncle, ""'that's nothing to signify. you are only a little bit tired.' but you, uncle, you seem in very good spirits this morning."""
5197,887-123289-0012.flac," i feel pleased at the thought that it is sure not to be shut against us. but then we shall have to refit the raft. of course. then as to provisions, have we enough to last?"
5198,887-123289-0003.flac," i wanted a whole hour to recover even a little. but a deluge of rain was still falling, though with that violence which generally denotes the near cessation of the storm."
5199,887-123289-0026.flac," i followed him to a headland after he had given his instructions to the hunter. their preserved meat, biscuits and tea made us an excellent meal one of the best i ever remember. hunger, the fresh air, the calm, quiet weather."
5200,887-123289-0030.flac, let it be axel island. then we had cleared 270 leagues of sea and we were 600 leagues from iceland. very well answered my uncle. let us start from that point and count four days storm.
5201,887-123289-0008.flac," all these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before i could answer my uncle's question. well now, he repeated, won't you tell me how you have slept? oh, very well, i said."
5202,887-123291-0038.flac," considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth. the long continued cooling of the globe produced chasms, fissures, clefts, and faults, into which very probably portions of the upper earth may have fallen."
5203,887-123291-0002.flac," near abbeville, in the department of sum, found a human jawbone 14 feet beneath the surface. it was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light, not far distant,"
5204,887-123291-0024.flac," in the 18th century, i would have stood up for choisers pre-adamite men against peter campet. i have perused a writing."
5205,887-123291-0008.flac," of certain grottoes in france, switzerland and belgium, as well as weapons, tools, earthen utensils, bones of children and adults. the existence therefore of men in the quarter-nary period seemed to become daily more certain."
5206,887-123291-0041.flac," in fact, it was a wonderful spectacle that of these generations of men and animals comingled in a common cemetery. then one very serious question arose presently, which we scarcely dared to suggest."
5207,887-123291-0014.flac," preserved it thus for so many ages, it might be so. but this dried corpse, with its parchment-like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame, the limbs still preserving their shape, sound teeth, abundant hair,"
5208,887-123291-0005.flac," therefore, the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted. it is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent"
5209,887-123291-0028.flac, have recognized in these bones nothing more remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the post-tershary period. but in the presence of this specimen to doubt would be to insult science. there stands the body. you may see it. touch it.
5210,887-123291-0009.flac, nor was this all. fresh discoveries of remains in the pliocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still. it is true that these remains were not human bones.
5211,887-123291-0017.flac," otto leidenbrock, yielding to his nature, forgot all the circumstances of our eventful journey, forgot where we were standing, forgot the vaulted cavern which contained us. no doubt he was in mind back again in his johannes."
5212,887-123291-0010.flac," but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork, such as fossil leg bones of animals, sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man."
5213,887-123291-0021.flac," the pretended body of arestis claimed to have been found by the spartans, and of the body of asterius, 10 cubits long."
5214,887-123291-0023.flac," you know, as well as i do gentlemen, the analysis made at lucerne in 1577 of those huge bones, which the celebrated dr. felix plader affirmed to be those of a giant 19 feet high."
5215,887-123291-0019.flac," emanent geologists have denied his existence, others no less eminent have affirmed it. the st. thomas' of paleontology, if they were here, might now touch him with their fingers and would be obliged to acknowledge their error."
5216,887-123291-0015.flac," and finger and toenails of frightful length. this desiccated mummy startled us by appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago. i stood mute before this apparition of remote antiquity. my uncle, usually so garless,"
5217,887-123291-0042.flac, had all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust of the earth down to the shores of the leidenbroxie when they were dead and turning to dust or had they lived and grown and died here in this subterranean world under a false sky
5218,887-123291-0027.flac, it was not to be done. the unlucky word would not come out. at the yohanim there would have been a laugh. giganto osteology at last the professor burst out between two words which i shall not record here.
5219,887-123291-0030.flac," i was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion. if i could only wash it in a solution of sulfuric acid, pursued my uncle, i should be able to clear it from all the earthly particles and the shells which are encrusted about it."
5220,887-123291-0020.flac, i am quite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of this kind. i know what capital-enterprising individuals like barnum have made out of fossil men. i have heard the tale of the knee-pan of ajax.
5221,887-123291-0022.flac," i have read the reports of the skeleton of trapani found in the 14th century, and which was at the time identified as that of polyphemus, and the history of the giant unearthed in the 16th century near palermo."
5222,887-123291-0026.flac, he could get no further.
5223,887-123291-0031.flac," but i do not possess that valuable solvent. yet, such as it is, the body shall tell us its own wonderful story. here, the professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton and handled it with the skill of a dexterous shelman."
5224,887-123291-0025.flac," here, my uncle's unfortunate infirmity met him, that of being unable in public to pronounce hard words."
5225,887-123291-0007.flac," we knew all these details, but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages. other similar maxilaries, the belonging to individuals of various types and different nations, were found in the loose grey soil,"
5226,887-123291-0004.flac," saw at once the importance of this discovery, proved to demonstration the genuineness of the bone in question, and became the most ardent defendants in what the english called this trial of a jawbone."
5227,887-123291-0016.flac," was struck down likewise. we raised the body. we stood it up against a rock. it seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits. we sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame. after some moment's silence, the professor was himself again."
5228,887-123291-0018.flac," holding forth to his pupils, for he assumed his learned air, and addressing himself to an imaginary audience he proceeded thus. gentlemen, i have the honor to introduce to you a man of the quaternary or post-tertiary system."
5229,887-123291-0033.flac," it is evidently caucasian. it is the white race our own. the skull of this fossil is a regular oval or rather ovoid. it exhibits no prominent cheekbones, no projecting jaws."
5230,887-123291-0040.flac," the fossil body was not the only one in this immense catacombe. we came upon other bodies at every step amongst this mortal dust, and my uncle might select the most curious of these specimens to demolish the incredulity of skeptics."
5231,887-123291-0003.flac," were found stone hatchets and flint arrowheads stained and encased by laps of time with a uniform coat of rust. the noise of this discovery was very great, not in france alone, but in england and in germany."
5232,887-123291-0001.flac," in a paleontological point of view, which had occurred a little while before our departure. on the 28th of march 1863,"
5233,887-123291-0011.flac," he was a predecessor of the mastodon. he was a contemporary of the southern elephant. he lived 100,000 years ago, when, according to geologists, the pliocene formation was in progress."
5234,887-123291-0039.flac," but there is the man surrounded by his own works, by hatchets, by flint arrowheads."
5235,887-123291-0006.flac," and agreeing in that with kuvye, he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the modernary period. my uncle, leidenbrock, along with the great body of the geologists, had maintained his ground, disputed and argued, until"
5236,887-123291-0013.flac," twenty yards farther on, he found himself face to face with a primitive man. it was a perfectly recognizable human body. had some particular soil, like that of the cemetery semichelle at bordeaux,"
5237,887-123291-0037.flac," how those strata on which he lays slip down into this enormous hollow in the globe, i confess i cannot answer that question."
5238,887-123291-0035.flac," it is nearly 90 degrees, but i will go further in my deductions and i will affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the gephetic race, which has since spread from the indies to the atlantic. don't smile gentlemen. nobody was smiling."
5239,887-123291-0029.flac, it is not a mere skeleton. it is an entire body.
5240,887-123291-0032.flac," you see, he said, that it is not six feet long and that we are still separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants."
5241,887-123291-0036.flac," but the learned professor was frequently disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned excentricities. yes, he pursued with animation. this is a fossil man, the contemporary of the macedons, whose remains fill this amphitheater."
5242,887-123291-0034.flac, it presents no appearance of that prognathism.
5243,887-123291-0000.flac," chapter 38 the professor in his chair again to understand this apostrophe of my uncles made to absent french savants, it will be necessary to allude to an event of high importance"
5244,887-123291-0012.flac," such then was the state of paleontological science, and what we knew of it was sufficient to explain our behavior in the presence of this dupendisk algoltha. anyone may now understand the frenzied excitement of my uncle, when,"
5245,887-123290-0002.flac," erect upon the rock, angry and threatening, otto lidenrock was a rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce achilles define the lightning. but i thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism."
5246,887-123290-0012.flac," i will not leave it until i have examined it. to understand what followed, it must be born in mind that"
5247,887-123290-0025.flac," but an impatient curiosity impelled our steps. crackling and rattling, our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric animals and interesting fossils. the possession of which is a matter of rivalry and contention."
5248,887-123290-0003.flac," just listen to me, i said firmly. ambition must have a limit somewhere. we cannot perform impossibilities. we are not at all fit for another sea voyage. who would dream of undertaking a voyage of 500 leagues upon a heap of rotten planks?"
5249,887-123290-0014.flac, the space between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable. it took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock. we trampled under our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed in the earliest ages of the world.
5250,887-123290-0015.flac, i also saw immense carapaces more than 15 feet in diameter.
5251,887-123290-0018.flac," this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within the interior of the earth, and it certainly had its origin in the waters of the ocean overhead, which had made their way hither through some fissure. yet,"
5252,887-123290-0031.flac," he laid his hand upon a bear's skull and cried with a voice trembling with excitement. axel! axel! a human head! a human skull, i cried, no less astonished."
5253,887-123290-0008.flac," a sail already hung from the new mast, and the wind was playing in its waving folds. the professor said a few words to the guide, and immediately he put everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure."
5254,887-123290-0007.flac," hans was finishing the repairs of the raft. one would have thought that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions. with a few more pieces of certa brand, he had refitted our vessel."
5255,887-123290-0001.flac," shall fire, air, and water make a combined attack against me? well, they shall know what a determined man can do. i will not yield. i will not stir a single foot backwards, and it will be seen whether man or nature is to have the upper hand."
5256,887-123290-0028.flac," leptotheria, maricopteria, lofiodia, amplotheria, megatheria, mastadons, protopithecae, teraeductols, and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction."
5257,887-123290-0029.flac," fancy and enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous alexandrian library burnt by omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes. just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle, professor leidenbrock."
5258,887-123290-0026.flac, a thousand cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection. i stood amazed. my uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky.
5259,887-123290-0019.flac," it must be believed that the fisher is now closed, and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a very short time. perhaps even this water, subjected to the fierce action of central heat, had partly been resolved into vapor."
5260,887-123290-0005.flac," i was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten minutes without interruption. not that the professor was paying any respectful attention to his nephew's arguments, but because he was deaf to all my eloquence."
5261,887-123290-0022.flac," wherever he saw a hole, he always wanted to know the depth of it. to him, this was important. we had traversed the shores of the leidenbrock sea for a mile when we observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil. it seemed upset, contorted."
5262,887-123290-0000.flac, we had gone backwards instead of forwards. but my uncle rapidly recovered himself. aha! will fate play tricks upon me? will the elements lay plots against me?
5263,887-123290-0017.flac," the waves had left manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone. this might, up to a certain point, explain the existence of an ocean forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe. but, in my opinion,"
5264,887-123290-0027.flac," his mouth gaping wide, his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles, his head balancing with an up and down motion, his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment. here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered,"
5265,887-123290-0024.flac," haze. there within three square miles were accumulated the materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages, a history scarcely outlined in the two recent strata of the inhabited world."
5266,887-123290-0030.flac, but more was to come when.
5267,887-123290-0010.flac, the icelanders seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget and deny himself. i could get nothing out of a servant so futilized as it were to his master. my only course was to proceed.
5268,887-123290-0016.flac," and ridged up in successive lines. i was therefore led to the conclusion that at one time this sea must have covered the ground on which we were treading. on the loose and scattered rocks,"
5269,887-123290-0013.flac," we were not really where the professor supposed we were. in fact, we were not upon the north shore of the sea. now let us start upon fresh discoveries, i said. and leaving hans to his work, we started off together."
5270,887-123290-0021.flac, fixed physical laws will or may always explain them. we were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil the deposits of the waters of former ages. the professor was carefully examining every little fissure in the rocks.
5271,887-123290-0009.flac," the air was clear, and the northwest wind blew steadily. what could i do? could i stand against the two? it was impossible. if hans had but taken my side, but no, it was not to be."
5272,887-123290-0011.flac," i was therefore going with as much resignation as i could find to resume my accustomed place on the raft, when my uncle laid his hand upon my shoulder. we shall not sail until tomorrow, he said."
5273,887-123290-0006.flac," to the raft he shouted. such was his only reply. it was no use for me to entreat, supplicate, get angry, or do anything else in the way of opposition."
5274,887-123290-0023.flac, where the remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together. huge mounds of bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance. they unculated away to the limits of the horizon and melted in the distance in a faint air.
5275,887-123290-0020.flac," and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests within the bowels of the earth. this theory of the phenomenon we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to me, for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature."
5276,887-123290-0004.flac," with a blanket in rags for a sail, a stick for a mast, and fierce winds in our teeth. we cannot steer, we shall be buffeted by the tempests, and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time."
5277,3436-172162-0029.flac," then sir goen said, surely it is unworthy of a night to travel in such sort. but sir lancelot heated him not. at nightfall."
5278,3436-172162-0040.flac," consulting his ring and finding that this was an enchantment, he burst his chains, seized his armor in spite of the visionary monsters who attempted to defend it, broke open the gates of the tower, and continued his journey."
5279,3436-172162-0024.flac," alas, for shame said sir lancelot, that ever one night should betray another. but it is an old saw. a good man is never in danger, but when he is in danger of a coward."
5280,3436-172162-0015.flac," for he dreaded, lest sir lancelot should have knowledge of what had been done. then the queen, prily, called unto her a page of her chamber that was swiftly hoarse, to whom she said. go thou when thou seeest thy time,"
5281,3436-172162-0039.flac," after an easy victory only doomed him to be carted in his turn. at night he was received at another castle, with great apparent hospitality. but found himself in the morning in a dungeon and loaded with chains."
5282,3436-172162-0027.flac," that he should take him in and convey him as speedily as possible for a liberal reward. the carter consented, and sir lancelot placed himself in the cart, and only lamented that with much jolting he made but little progress."
5283,3436-172162-0007.flac, but the ten noble knights all raid in green for meang. so he prepared him twenty men of arms and a hundred archers to take captive the queen and her knights.
5284,3436-172162-0018.flac," then they, that were best-horsed, chased him and shot at him. but the child went from them all. then sir malikin said to the queen, madame, ye are about to betray me, but i shall arrange for soloncelot that he shall not come lightly at you."
5285,3436-172162-0030.flac," but to admit his companion, whom she supposed to be a criminal, or at least a prisoner, it pleased her not."
5286,3436-172162-0025.flac," then sir lancelot went a while, and he was exceedingly comforted by his armor, his shield, and his spear, and all that belonged to him. then by chance there came by him a cart that came thither to fetch wood."
5287,3436-172162-0021.flac," unless i may rescue that noble lady. then eagerly he asked his armor and put it on him, and mounted his horse and rode as fast as he might."
5288,3436-172162-0006.flac," son to king bradamagas, who loved queen gweniver passing well, and so had he done long in many years. now this night, sir malekens learned the queen's purpose, and that she had no men of arms with her."
5289,3436-172162-0020.flac," and the child came to westminster and found sir lancelot, and told his message and delivered him the queen's ring. alas, sir lancelot."
5290,3436-172162-0034.flac," so lonson lot found his way beset with obstacles, which he encountered successfully, but not without much loss of time. as evening approached, he was met by a young and sportive damsel, who galley proposed to him a supper."
5291,3436-172162-0023.flac," and they shot at him, and smote his horse so that he fell. then soloncelot left his horse and went on foot, but there lay so many ditches and hedges betwixt the archers and him that he might not meddle with them."
5292,3436-172162-0045.flac," ah, lancelot, my knight, truly have i been told that thou art no longer worthy of me. these words instantly revive the drooping knight. he resumed it once his usual superiority, and soon laid at his feet his haughty adversary."
5293,3436-172162-0046.flac," moved by the entreaties of brett amagas, ordered him to withhold the blow, and he obeyed. the castle and its prisoners were now at his disposal. lonsalot hastened the apartment of the queen, threw himself at her feet,"
5294,3436-172162-0032.flac, neither would the damsels prepare a bed for him. he seized the first he found unoccupied and was left undisturbed. next morning he saw from the turrets of the castle a train accompanying a lady whom he imagined to be the queen.
5295,3436-172162-0036.flac," suddenly, the scene changed, and he was assailed by six furious ruffians whom he dealt with so vigorously that most of them were speedily disabled. when again, there was a change, and he found himself alone with his fair hostess."
5296,3436-172162-0000.flac, the adventure of the cart. it befell in the month of may. queen gwynether called to her nights of the table-round and gave them warning that early upon the morrow she would ride a maying into the woods and fields beside westminster.
5297,3436-172162-0044.flac," and under the eyes of the fair captive. lanzelot was infeebled by his wounds and fought not with his usual spirit, and the contest for a time was doubtful."
5298,3436-172162-0048.flac," for her lovers suddenly started from her, and bitterly lamenting that he had incurred the displeasure of his sovereign lady, rushed out of the castle, through his sword and his shield to the right and left, ran furiously into the woods, and disappeared."
5299,3436-172162-0047.flac," and was about to kiss her hand when she exclaimed, ah, lonesolot, why do i see the again yet feel thee to be no longer worthy of me? after having been disgracefully drawn about the country in a, she had not time to finish the phrase."
5300,3436-172162-0049.flac," it seems that the story of the abominable cart which haunted lanzelot at every step had reached the ears of sir kay, who had told it to the queen as a proof that her knight must have been dishonored."
5301,3436-172162-0038.flac," who all seem to have learned by some means his disgraceful drive in the cart. one, more insulin than the rest, had the audacity to interrupt him during dinner, and even to risk a battle in support of his pleasantry. lancelot"
5302,3436-172162-0051.flac," and that it was his duty to set her right. he therefore returned, compelled maligans to release his prisoners."
5303,3436-172162-0016.flac," and bear this ring unto sir lancelot, and pray him as he loveth me, that he will see me and rescue me, and spare not thy horse,"" said the queen. neither for water nor for land."
5304,3436-172162-0035.flac," at her castle. the knight, who was hungry and weary, accepted the offer, though with no very good grace. he followed the lady to her castle and ate voraciously of her supper, but it was quite impenetrable to all her amorous advances."
5305,3436-172162-0043.flac," offered him his assistance, and informed him that the queen was safe in his castle, but could only be rescued by encountering maligans. lanzelod demanded the battle for the next day, and accordingly it took place at the foot of the tower."
5306,3436-172162-0052.flac, at the satisfaction of meeting him the next day.
5307,3436-172162-0008.flac," in the merry month of may, in a mourned break of day, with a troop of damsels playing, the queen for seuth went forth, a man, old song. so when the queen had made,"
5308,3436-172162-0004.flac," sir dodinas, lusavaj, sir ozanah, sir ladinas, sir percent of ind, sir ironside, and sir pelios. and these ten knights made them ready."
5309,3436-172162-0050.flac," three days elapsed, during which lonsalod wandered without knowing where he went. till at last he began to reflect that his mistress had doubtless been deceived by misrepresentation."
5310,3436-172162-0037.flac," which she told him would buy its changes of color, disclosed to him all enchantments, and enabled him to subdue them. sir lancelot pursued his journey without being much incommoted except by the taunts of travelers."
5311,3436-172162-0003.flac," so they made them ready, and these were the names of the knights. sir kay, the sennishall. sir agravain. sir brandilus. sir sagrimor, ludisiorus."
5312,3436-172162-0005.flac," so upon the moorn they took their horses, with the queen, and rode a man in woods and meadows as it pleased them, in great joy and delight. now there was a knight."
5313,3436-172162-0012.flac," then they lashed together with swords till several were smitten to the earth. so when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully oppressed, and needs must be slain at the last, then for pity and sorrow she cried, surma'legans!"
5314,3436-172162-0028.flac," he drew near to see who it might be. then soloncelot told him how the queen had been carried off, and how, in hastening to her rescue, his horse had been disabled, and he had been compelled to avail himself of the cart rather than give up his enterprise."
5315,3436-172162-0017.flac," and lightly he took his horse with the spurs, and departed as fast as he might. and when sir maligan saw him so flea, he understood that it was by the queen's commandment for to warn sir lancelot."
5316,3436-172162-0011.flac," then the ten knights of the round table threw their swords, and the other party run at them with their spears."
5317,3436-172162-0031.flac," at supper, sir lonselot came near being consigned to the kitchen."
5318,3436-172162-0001.flac," and i warn ye that there be none of you, but he be well-horst, and that ye all be clothed in green, either silk or cloth, and i shall bring with me ten ladies, and every night shall have a lady behind him."
5319,3436-172162-0014.flac," madam,"" said malligan's, for your sake, they shall be led with you into my own castle, if that ye will be ruled and ride with me."" then sir malligan's charge them all, then none should depart from the queen."
5320,3436-172162-0019.flac," then he rode with her and them all to his castle, in all the haste that they might. and by the way, sir maligan's late and ambushed the best archers that he had to wait for sir lancelot."
5321,3436-172162-0041.flac," at length his progress was checked by a wide and rapid torrent, which could only be passed on a narrow bridge, on which a false step would prove his destruction. lads a lot, leading his horse by the bridle and making him swim by his side."
5322,3436-172162-0013.flac," slee not my normal nights, and i will go with you upon this covenant that..."
5323,3436-172162-0009.flac," trater knight said queen whenever. what wilt thou do, wilt thou shame thyself? be think thee how thou art a king's son, and a knight of the table round, and how thou art about to dishonor all knighthood and thyself."
5324,3436-172162-0026.flac," carts were little used except for carrying awful, and for conveying criminals to execution. but sir lancelot took no thought of anything but the necessity of haste for the purpose of rescuing the queen. so he demanded of the carter."
5325,3436-172162-0002.flac," and every night shall have a squire and two ye yeoman, and all well-horced. for thus it chanced one more, when all the court-green-suited but with plumes that mocked the may, had been their want, amaying."
5326,3436-172162-0033.flac," the lady of the castle supplied sir lancelot with a horse, and they traversed the plain at full speed. they learned from some travelers whom they met, that there were two roads which led to the castle of sir maligons. here, therefore, the friends separated."
5327,3436-172162-0010.flac," be it as it may, sitser maligans. know you well, madam, i have loved you many a year, and never till now could i get you to such advantages i do now, and therefore i will take you as i find you."
5328,3436-172162-0022.flac," and men say he took the water at westminster ridge and made his horse swim over thames onto lambeth. then, within a while, he came to a wood where was a narrow way, and there the archers were laid in ambush."
5329,3436-172162-0042.flac," passed over the bridge, and was attacked, as soon as he reached the bank, by a lion, and a leopard, both of which he slew. and then, exhausted and bleeding, seated himself on the grass, and endeavored to bind up his wounds."
5330,3436-172171-0025.flac," that she fell senseless to the ground, then said kay to percival, go after the night who went hence to the meadow, overthrow him and recover the golden goblet and possess thyself of his horse and arms, and thou shalt have nighthood."
5331,3436-172171-0052.flac," and who he was. but percival was so intent upon his thought that he gave him no answer, then the youth thrust at percival with his lands, and percival turned upon him and struck him to the ground."
5332,3436-172171-0064.flac," gladly will i do so answered, percival, so they went together to arthur and saluted him."
5333,3436-172171-0027.flac, did his bow see anyone coming after me from the court?
5334,3436-172171-0018.flac," percival entered the hall upon the bony pie-balled horse, with his uncouth trappings. in the center of the hall stood kay the sennishall. tell me, tall man, said percival, is that arthur yonder?"
5335,3436-172171-0000.flac, where he was brought up in total ignorance of arms and chivalry. he was allowed no weapon.
5336,3436-172171-0023.flac," till she had seen him, who would be the flower of chivalry. now this damsel came up to percival and told him, smiling, that if he lived he would be one of the bravest and best of knights. truly said kay."
5337,3436-172171-0034.flac," sir o'ain unfass on the armor and helped percival to put it on, and taught him how to put his foot in the stirrup and use the spur."
5338,3436-172171-0003.flac," he said to his mother, mother, what are those, yonder? they are angels, my son, said she, my, my faith, i will go and become an angel with them, and, first of all, went to the road and met them."
5339,3436-172171-0037.flac, went back to the court and related all these things to arthur and gwynever and to all the household.
5340,3436-172171-0054.flac," and percival thrust at him with his lance and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade. and while he lay thus stunned, his horse returned back in a wild and prancing pace. then said..."
5341,3436-172171-0047.flac," percival entered a valley and came to a hermit's cell, and the hermit welcomed him gladly, and there he spent the night. and in the morning he arose, and when he went forth, behold, a shower of snow had fallen in the night, and a hawk."
5342,3436-172171-0043.flac," if thou seest ought to cause thy wonder, ask not the meaning of it. if no one has the courtesy to inform thee, the reproach will not fall upon thee but upon me that am thy teacher."
5343,3436-172171-0006.flac," and percival, in return, gave him such information as he had. then percival returned to his mother and said to her, ""'mother, those were not angels, but honorable knights,' then his mother swooned away."
5344,3436-172171-0014.flac," and he gave the maiden his own ring in exchange for hers. then he mounted his horse and rode away. percival journey dawned till he arrived at arthur's court, and it so happened"
5345,3436-172171-0061.flac," and truly he is the night who fought with thee last."" ""'verily,' said percival, ""'i am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the smiling maiden,' then percival told in his name and said,"
5346,3436-172171-0042.flac," footnote. the word means both fisher and sinner. thou shalt remain with me a space, in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries, and courtesy and noble bearing. and this do thou remember?"
5347,3436-172171-0004.flac," tell me good lad said one of them. saust thou night pass this way, either today or yesterday?"
5348,3436-172171-0032.flac," verily, said sirawain, the son of aureon, to kay the sennishal. that was ill advised to send that madman after the night. for he must either be overthrown of flea, and either way it will be a disgrace to arthur and his warriors."
5349,3436-172171-0049.flac," to the hair of the lady that best he loved, which was blacker than jet, and to her skin, which was wider than the snow, and to the two red spots upon her cheeks, which were redder than the blood upon the snow."
5350,3436-172171-0033.flac," therefore, will i go to see what has befallen him?"" so cyril wayne went to the meadow, and he found percival trying in vain to get the dead knight's armor off, in order to close himself with it."
5351,3436-172171-0024.flac," that art ill-talked to remain a year at arthur's court with choice of society, and smile on no one, and now before the face of arthur and all his knights, to call such a man as this the flower of knighthood."
5352,3436-172171-0065.flac," him whom thou hast sought so long. ""'welcome unto thee, chiefden,' said arthur, and here upon there came the queen and her hand-bathens, and the percival saluted them, and they were rejoiced to see him and bade him welcome."
5353,3436-172171-0050.flac," now arthur and his household were in search of percival, and by chance they came that way. no ye, said arthur, who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook of yonder? lord, said one of them."
5354,3436-172171-0048.flac," had killed a wild foul in front of the cell, and the noise of the horse had scared the hawk away, and a raven, allighted on the bird, and percival stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the snow,"
5355,3436-172171-0028.flac," and to take from thee the goblet and thy horse and armor for myself."" ""'silence,' said the knight. ""'go back to the court, until arthur, either to come himself,"
5356,3436-172171-0031.flac," my mother's servants were not used to play with me in this wise, so thus will i play with thee."" and he threw at him one of his sharp-pointed sticks, and it struck him in the eye, and came out at the back of his head, so that he fell down lifeless."
5357,3436-172171-0012.flac," perceiving in one corner of the tent some food, two flasks full of wine and some boars flesh roasted. he said, my mother told me whenever i saw meat and drink to take it."
5358,3436-172171-0013.flac," and he ate greedily for he was very hungry. the maiden said, sir, thou hadest best go quickly from here, for fear that my friends should come and evil should be fall you."" but percival said,"
5359,3436-172171-0017.flac," for it seemed to them that no one would have ventured on so daring an outrage unless he possessed such powers through magic or charms that none could be able to punish him. just then, behold!"
5360,3436-172171-0008.flac," and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses. when he came again to his mother, the countess had recovered from her swoon. my son said she, desirous thou to ride forth."
5361,3436-172171-0057.flac, and percival was resting on the shaft of his spear pondering the same thought.
5362,3436-172171-0026.flac," i will do so, tall man,"" said percival. so he turned his horse's head toward the meadow, and when he came there, the knight was writing up and down, proud of his strength and valor and noble mean. tell me, sir, the knight."
5363,3436-172171-0002.flac," not only the animals of the chase for the table, but even birds on the wing. at length, however, percival was roused to a desire of military renown by seeing in the forest five knights who were in complete armor."
5364,3436-172171-0038.flac," and he came to a lake on the side of which was a fair castle, and on the border of the lake he saw a horrid man sitting upon a velvet cushion, and his attendance were fishing in the lake."
5365,3436-172171-0020.flac, then all the household began to cheer and laugh at him. there was a certain dam so who had been a whole year at arthur's court.
5366,3436-172171-0040.flac," and the horrid headed man received percival courteously and asked him to sit by him on the cushion. when it was time, the tables were set and they went to meet. and when they had finished their meet, the horrid headed man asked percival,"
5367,3436-172171-0045.flac," and when all the companies saw this, they began to weep and lament. but for all that, the man did not break off his discourse with percival. and as he did not tell him the meaning of what he saw, he forebore to ask him concerning it."
5368,3436-172171-0011.flac," for thus shelter thou acquire fame, yet freely give it to another. for thus thou shalt obtain praise. if thou see a fair woman, pay court to her. for thus thou wilt obtain love."
5369,3436-172171-0015.flac," for when her page was serving the queen with a golden goblet, this night struck the arm of the page and dashed the wine in the queen's face and over her stomacher. then he said..."
5370,3436-172171-0046.flac," now, the cup that percival saw was the sangriol, and the spear, the sacred spear, and afterwards, king petr removed with those sacred relics into a far country. one evening."
5371,3436-172171-0029.flac," and unless he do so quickly i will not wait for him."" by my faith, said percival, choose now whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly, for i will have the horse and the arms and the goblet."
5372,3436-172171-0044.flac," while percival and his uncle discussed together, percival will be held to youths enter the hall, bearing a golden cup and a spear of mighty size, with blood dripping from its point to the ground."
5373,3436-172171-0001.flac," which was the only thing of all her lord's fair gear that his mother carried to the wood with her. in the use of this, he became so skillful that he could kill with it."
5374,3436-172171-0059.flac," and two men have been before on this errand. that is true, said percival, and uncurtiously they came. they attacked me, and i was annoyed at their act. then he told him the thought that occupied his mind."
5375,3436-172171-0022.flac," and carried a bell or bobble in his hand. though call the fool, his words were often weighed and remembered as if there were a sort of irregular meaning in them."
5376,3436-172171-0010.flac," and ask of him to bestow knighthood on thee, and whenever thou seeest a church repeat there thy paternoster."
5377,3436-172171-0030.flac," upon this, the knight ran at him furiously, and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear."
5378,3436-172171-0005.flac," ""'such and one as i am,' said the knight. ""'if that will tell me what i ask thee, i will tell thee what thou askest me.' ""'gladly will i do so,' said sir o'ainne. for that was the knight's name.'"
5379,3436-172171-0036.flac," to revenge the injury he did to the maiden, but take thal the goblet, queen gwyneth her, and tell king arthur that wherever i am i will be his vessel, and will do him what prophet and service i can. and sir wayne"
5380,3436-172171-0009.flac," yes, with thy leave, said he, go forward then, she said, to the court of arthur, where there are the best and the noblest and the most bountiful of men. and tell him thou art percival, the son of pellanore."
5381,3436-172171-0007.flac," and percival went to the place where they kept the horses that carried firewood and provisions for the castle. and he took a bony, pieballed horse which seemed to him the strongest of them, and he pressed a pack into the form of a saddle."
5382,3436-172171-0021.flac," and the king's fool, footnote, a fool was a common appendage of the courts of those days when this romance was written. a fool was the ornament held in next estimation to a dwarf. he wore a white dress with a yellow bonnet."
5383,3436-172171-0063.flac," i am right glad to meet thee, said percival, for i have everywhere heard of thy prowess and uprightness, and i solicit thy fellowship. thou shalt have it by my faith, and grant me thine,"" said he."
5384,3436-172171-0039.flac," when the horrid headed man beheld percival approaching, he arose and went into the castle. percival rode to the castle, and the door was open, and he entered the hall."
5385,3436-172171-0058.flac," if i thought it would be as agreeable to thee, as it would be to me, i would converse with thee. i have also a message from arthur unto thee, to pray thee to come and visit him."
5386,3436-172171-0051.flac, i will go and learn who he is.
5387,3436-172171-0016.flac," let him follow me to the meadow. so the night took his horse and rode to the meadow, carrying away the golden goblet, and all the household hung down their heads, and no one offered to follow the night to take vengeance upon him."
5388,3436-172171-0062.flac," who are thou? and he replied,"
5389,3436-172171-0053.flac," and when the youth returned to the king and told how rudely he had been treated, sir kay said, i will go myself."" and when he greeted percival and got no answer, he spoke to him rudely and angrily."
5390,3436-172171-0055.flac, sir named the golden tung because he was the most curt he has night in arthur's court. it is not fitting that any should disturb an honorable night from his thought unadvisedly. for either he is pondering some damage that he has sustained.
5391,3436-172171-0056.flac," or is thinking of the lady whom best he loves. if it seemed well to the lord, i will go and see if this knight has changed from his thought, and if he has, i will ask him courteously to come and visit thee."
5392,3436-172171-0019.flac," what would is thou with arthur?"" asked kay. my mother told me to go to arthur, and receive knighthood from him. my wife faith said he. thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and with arms."
5393,3436-172171-0041.flac," if he knew how to fight with the sword, i do not set percival, but were i to be taught doubtless i should. and the horrid headed man said to him, i am thy uncle, thy mother's brother. i am called king petra."
5394,3436-172171-0060.flac," and gawain said, this was not an ungentle thought, and i should marvel if it were pleasant for thee to be drawn from it. then, said percival, tell me, is sir kay in arthur's court?"
5395,3436-172171-0035.flac," and urged on his horse with a stick. then a wane would have had him return to the court to receive the praise that was his due. but percival said, i will not come to the court till i have encountered the tall man that is there."
5396,8088-284756-0023.flac," you can judge for yourself whether the trip was worthwhile. here she is. with the jestery flung open the door, and i stared, following as glance, down at the great town swimming pool. it is difficult for me to describe the scene."
5397,8088-284756-0044.flac," she managed to claw me just once, mercer resumed, wrapping the robe about him again. then i got out and called on carson for help. i put him into a bathing suit and we both endeavored to corner her."
5398,8088-284756-0020.flac," his eyes, dark and large, smiled easily and shone with interest, but his almost beautiful mouth beneath the long slim mustache, always closely cropped, seldom smiled with his eyes. but it was his present excited speech that amazes me most."
5399,8088-284756-0075.flac," i had not forgotten the livid, jagged furrows in mercher's side. quickly as i shot to the ladder she was there before me, a dim, wavering, white-shaped, waiting. i paused, holding to a run of a ladder with one hand."
5400,8088-284756-0060.flac," so that the elongated electrode pressed against the back of his neck, extending a few inches down his spine. the other three circular electrodes rested on his forehead and either side of his head."
5401,8088-284756-0116.flac," but there is no retracing the way. i nodded, my head bowed on my streaming chest. sorry, mercer, i muttered. something got into me. those big eyes of hers seemed to tug threads of memory buried. i can't describe it."
5402,8088-284756-0029.flac," the great cloud of corn-colored hair floated down about it, falling below the knees. slowly, with a grace of movement comparable only with the slow soaring of a gall, she came toward me, walking on the bottom of the pool through the clear water as though she floated in air."
5403,8088-284756-0002.flac," during a thousand dangers for the sake of the straw pack bottles they carried, sea bronze meant with hard flat muscles and fearless eyes, ready guns slapping their thighs as they..."
5404,8088-284756-0012.flac," with the gravel rattling on my fenders, i turned off the concrete and swept between the two massive, stuccoed pillars that guarded the drive. both of them boarded corroded bronze plates, the billows, the name given the monstrosity by the original owner."
5405,8088-284756-0028.flac," porcelain? i asked porcelain. the thing had an indescribably eerie effect. he laughed wildly. porcelain, watch. look. my eyes followed his pointing finger."
5406,8088-284756-0042.flac," i ran through the french windows out into the patio. for a moment she ran after me, rather awkwardly and heavily, but swiftly, nevertheless, then she saw the pool. apparently forgetting that i existed, she leaped into the water."
5407,8088-284756-0027.flac," even in the soft light i could see her perfectly. through the clear water her pale body outline sharply against the jade green tiles. i tore myself away from the staring, curious eyes of the figure. in god's name, mercer, what is it?"
5408,8088-284756-0119.flac," we can try, old timer, i set a bit shakenly. mercer hurried back to the other side of the pool, and i adjusted my headset again, smiling down at the girl."
5409,8088-284756-0109.flac," the girl was thinking of her suffering, taken out of her native element."
5410,8088-284756-0051.flac," i asked, eagerly, glancing down at the beautiful pale face that glimmered up at me through the clear water of the pool. why try it on her, exclaim mercer with a mounting enthusiasm? don't you see, taylor?"
5411,8088-284756-0001.flac," there was a real romance and adventure. rum runners, seeking out their hidden port with their cargo of contraband from cuba, heading fearlessly through the darkness, fighting the high seas, still running after the storm of a day or so before."
5412,8088-284756-0063.flac," very nice old chap, carson. impressive even in his bathing suit. mercer was mighty lucky to have a man like carson. something seemed to tick suddenly. somewhere deep in my consciousness. yes, that's very true."
5413,8088-284756-0069.flac," she was such a slim, graceful, almost delicate little thing. the thought that three strong men might not be able to control her seemed almost amusing. you haven't seen her in action yet, said mercer grimley."
5414,8088-284756-0006.flac," i had never heard mercer speak in that high, pitched, excited voice before. his usual speech was slow and thoughtful, almost idatic."
5415,8088-284756-0068.flac," i'll lengthen these leads so that we can run them out into the pool, and then we'll be ready. somehow, we must induce her to wear one of these things, even if we have to use force. i'm sure the three of us can handle her. we should be able to, i smiled."
5416,8088-284756-0065.flac," i received your thoughts regarding carson, and then turned the switch so that you received my thought, and you did. rather gingerly, i removed the thing for my head and laid it on the table. it's wizardly, mercer. if it will work as well on her. it will. i know it will."
5417,8088-284756-0083.flac," i pointed upward for i was feeling the need for fresh air again and slowly mounted the ladder. this time she did not grasp me, but watched me intently as though understanding what i did, and the reasons for it."
5418,8088-284756-0112.flac," there was a strange fascination about this girl from the depths of the sea, a subtle appeal that was answered from some deep subterranean cavern of my being. i forgot for the moment who and what i was."
5419,8088-284756-0077.flac," perhaps, i thought quickly this was with her a sign of greeting. i lifted my own arm and returned the salutation, if salutation it were, aware of a strange rising and falling sound, as of a distant humming in my ears."
5420,8088-284756-0053.flac," look, and he held out a thin aristocratic brown hand before my eyes, a hand that shook with nervous excitement. i don't blame you,"" i said quickly."
5421,8088-284756-0058.flac," nothing assembled. put the different antenna plug into these jacks, like this. he picked up a weird hastily built contrivance composed of two semi-circular pieces of spring brass, crossed at right angles."
5422,8088-284756-0074.flac," i headed directly towards the heavy bronze ladder that led to the bottom of the pool. i had two reasons in mind. i would need something to keep me under water with my lungs full of air, and i could get out quickly if it were necessary."
5423,8088-284756-0038.flac," the shore was littered with all sorts of flotsam and jetsam washed up by the big storm, and i was just thinking that i would have to have a man with a truck come and clean up the shore in front of the place, when, in a little sandy pool, i saw her."
5424,8088-284756-0111.flac, adjusted to her own ideas of what a man should be. i flung the instrument from my head and dropped to the bottom of the pool. i gripped both her shoulders gently to express my thanks and friendship. my heart was pounding.
5425,8088-284756-0007.flac," if it weren't urgent, i wouldn't be calling you. you know, will you come? you bet. i said quickly, feeling rather afull for ragging him when he was in such deadly earnest. have the receiver snapped and crackled."
5426,8088-284756-0092.flac," i saw him run up to the pool and lift this slim, pale figure in his arms."
5427,8088-284756-0057.flac," and in the center a switch with four contact points. a heavy, sneaky cable led from this panel to the maze of apparatus further on. this is the control panel, explain mercer. the whole affair, you understand, is in laboratory form."
5428,8088-284756-0049.flac," i think i have what you call my thought telegraph perfected, experimentally. he explained rapidly. i fell asleep working on it at 3 o'clock, or thereabouts this morning, and some tests with cursons seemed to indicate that it is a success."
5429,8088-284756-0082.flac, i smiled back at her and shook my head.
5430,8088-284756-0033.flac, and her bosom rising and falling beneath the veil of pale gold hair. she was breathing water. mercer literally jerked me away from the edge of the pool.
5431,8088-284756-0089.flac," i smiled and nodded and pressed her shoulder in a token of friendly greeting, then, just during toward my own head again and pointing upward. i climbed the ladder. all right, mercer, i shouted, start at once before she grows restless."
5432,8088-284756-0052.flac," if it will work on her and we can direct her thoughts, we can find out her history. the history of her people will add a page to scientific history, a whole big chapter. that will make us famous. man, this is so big it swept me off my feet."
5433,8088-284756-0088.flac, no mean feed on her water. she hesitated a moment and then her eyes fixed on mine.
5434,8088-284756-0059.flac," on all forehands were bright silver electrodes, three of them circular in shape, one of them elongated and slightly curved. with a quick, nervous gesture, mercer fitted the thing to his head."
5435,8088-284756-0005.flac," get in your car and come down here as fast as possible. come just as you are, and... what's the matter? i managed to interrupt him. berglers?"
5436,8088-284756-0022.flac," the other end of the room was nearly all glass, and opened onto the patio and the swimming pool. mercer paused a moment, with his hand on the knob of the door, a strange light in his dark eyes. now you'll see why i called you here, he said, tensely."
5437,8088-284756-0018.flac," mercer, he laughed excitedly. you'll see, you'll see. no, i'm not in love. and i want you to help and not admire. there are only curse in myself here, you know? and the job's too big for the two of us."
5438,8088-284756-0098.flac," the structures vary greatly in size and seem to be a range in some sort of regular order, like houses along the narrow street."
5439,8088-284756-0010.flac," mercer picked the place up for me at a song. the monstrosity was some four miles further out from town, and off the highway perhaps a half mile more."
5440,8088-284756-0024.flac," the patio was not large, but it was beautifully done. flowers and shrubs, even a few small palms, grew in profusion in the enclosure, while above, through the movable glass roof, made in sections to disappear and find weather."
5441,8088-284756-0105.flac," its naked ribs packed with drifted sand. sauntering dreamily, she moved away from the ancient derelict. suddenly a dim shadow swept across the sand at her feet, and she arrowed from the spot like a white slim meteor."
5442,8088-284756-0031.flac," i tried to look away and found myself unable to move. i felt mercher's tense, sudden grip upon my arm, but i did not, could not, look at him. she- she smiling, i heard him exclaim."
5443,8088-284756-0062.flac," he adjusted a second contrivance upon my head, smiling as i shrank from the contact of the cold metal on my skin, and think! he moved the switch from the position marked off to the second contact point, watching me intently, his dark eyes gleaming."
5444,8088-284756-0030.flac," fascinated, i watched her. her eyes, startlingly large, and dark and the strangely white face, were fixed on mine. there was nothing sinister in the gaze, yet i felt my body shaking as though in a grip of a terrible fear."
5445,8088-284756-0061.flac," some 10 feet in length, ending in a simple switchboard plug, which mercer faded into the uppermost of the three jacks. now, he directed, you put on this one."
5446,8088-284756-0014.flac," apparently, every bulb in the place was burning. just a few yards beyond the surf, boomed hollowly on the smooth, shady shore, littered now. i knew by the pitiful spoils of the storm."
5447,8088-284756-0107.flac," the white figure of the girl shot onward through the scarlet flood. blinded, she did not see that the jutting ribs of the ancient ship were in her path. i seemed to see her crash, head on into one of the massive timbers."
5448,8088-284756-0076.flac," she came closer, walking with the airy grace i had noted before. and my heart pounded against my ribs as she raised one long, slim arm towards me."
5449,8088-284756-0013.flac," a newly-rich munitions manufacturer. the structure itself loomed up before me in a few seconds, a rambling affair with square shoulder balconies and a great deal of rot iron work after the most flamboyant spanish pattern. it was ablaze with light."
5450,8088-284756-0118.flac," i asked hesitantly. i believe, reply mercer, that she can give us the history of her people, if we can only make her understand what we wish. god, if we only could."
5451,8088-284756-0039.flac," she was laying face down in the water motionless, her head towards the sea, one arm stretched out before her, and her long hair wrapped around her like a half transparent cloak. i ran up and lifted her from the water, her body was cold and definitely white."
5452,8088-284756-0114.flac," then, strangling, i tore myself from her embrace and shot to the surface. coughing, i cleared my lungs to the water i had inhaled. i was weak in shaking when i finished, but my head was clear. the grip of the strange fantasy that had gripped me was shaken off."
5453,8088-284756-0008.flac, usually the very soul of courtesy and consideration.
5454,8088-284756-0046.flac," we moved out of the room. nothing human could live under water and breathe water as she does. mercer paused a moment staring at me oddly. the human race, he said gravely, came up out of sea. the human race as we know it, some may have gone back."
5455,8088-284756-0102.flac," the clinging trusses were censured at the waist with a sword of cord of twisted orange-colored material, and some of the younger women wore bands of the same material around their brows. nearest of all the figures was the girl who was visualizing all this for us."
5456,8088-284756-0096.flac," and i sensed through the medium of the instrument i wore that she was thinking of me. i saw my own features idealized, glowing with the strange beauty that was certainly none of my own. i realized that i saw myself in short as she saw me."
5457,8088-284756-0073.flac," there was something devilishly fascinating about the girl's great, dark, searching eyes. i'm going in, i said, horse-le."
5458,8088-284756-0093.flac," i visualized them just as i could close my eyes and visualize, for example, the fireplace in the living room of my own home. i looked down at the girl. she was frowning, and her eyes were very wide."
5459,8088-284756-0050.flac," i should have called you tomorrow for further test. nearly five years at damn hard work to a successful conclusion, taylor."
5460,8088-284756-0037.flac, i walked along briskly for perhaps five minutes.
5461,8088-284756-0091.flac," so that my head remained out of water, and smiled down at the girl, touching the instrument on my head, and then pointing to hers. i could sense mercer's thoughts now. he was picturing himself walking along the shore, with the stormy ocean in the background."
5462,8088-284756-0016.flac," he was wearing a bathrobe, hastily flung on over a damp bathing suit, his bare legs terminating in a pair of disreputable slippers. fine, taylor, he greeted me. i suppose you're wondering what it's all about. i don't blame you, but come in, come in."
5463,8088-284756-0103.flac," she was walking slowly away from the cluster of choral structures. once or twice she paused and seemed to hold conversation with others of the strange people, but each time she moved on, the choral structures grew smaller and poorer."
5464,8088-284756-0086.flac," i'll try to impress that honor, understand? i nodded and picked up one of the instruments. fire went ready, gridly. i commented and sank again to the bottom of the pool. i touched the girl's head with one finger, and then pointed to my own head."
5465,8088-284756-0054.flac," let's get busy. what can i do? mercer reached around the door into the laboratory and pressed a button. for carson, he explained, we'll need his help. in the meantime, we'll look over the setup. the apparatus is strewn all over the place."
5466,8088-284756-0100.flac," or at times, shot overhead like fair to bull torpedoes. there were both men and women moving there. the men were broader of shoulder and their hair, which they worked to their knees with somewhat darker and color than that of the women. both sexes were slim."
5467,8088-284756-0064.flac," the words were not spoken. i did not hear them. i knew them. what? i glanced at mercer, and he laughed aloud with pleasure and excitement. it worked, he cried."
5468,8088-284756-0045.flac," carson got two bad scratches and one rather serious bite that i have bandaged. i have a number of lacerations, but i didn't fare so badly as carson because i am faster in the water than he is. the harder we tried, the more determined i became."
5469,8088-284756-0113.flac," her great, weirdly blue eyes seemed to bore into my brain. i could feel them throbbing there. i forgot time and space. i saw only that pale, smiling face in those great dark eyes."
5470,8088-284756-0094.flac," her head was a little on one side, in the attitude of one who listens intently. slowly and carefully, mercer thought out the whole story of his experiences with the girl until she had plunged into the pool. then, i saw again the beach."
5471,8088-284756-0040.flac," and took the liquor in a single draft. she did not seem to drink it, but sucked it out of the glass in a single amazing gulp. that's the only word for it."
5472,8088-284756-0011.flac," i made the four miles in just a shade over that many minutes, and clamped on the brakes as i saw the entrance to the little drive that led towards the sea, and mercer's estate."
5473,8088-284756-0071.flac," it was the first time i had seen her move in this fashion. she seemed to propel herself with a sudden mighty thrust of her feet against the bottom. she darted through the water with the speed of an arrow, yet stopped as gently as though she had merely floated there."
5474,8088-284756-0055.flac," he had not exaggerated. the setup consisted of a whole bank of tubes, each one at its own shielding copper box. on a much drilled horizontal panel, propped up on insulators, were half a score of delicate meters of one kind and another."
5475,8088-284756-0036.flac," late this afternoon i decided to go for a little walk along the beach. mercer began. i had been working like the devil since early in the morning, running some tests on what you call my thought telegraph. i felt the need of some fresh shear."
5476,8088-284756-0078.flac," the sound sees suddenly, honorizing note, as though of inquiry, and it dawned on me that i had heard the speech of the strange creature. before i could think of a course of action, my aching lungs reminded me of the need of air."
5477,8088-284756-0095.flac," i was aware of the soft little tick in the center of my brain that announced that the switch had been moved to another contact point. i glanced down at her. she was staring up at me with her great, curious eyes."
5478,8088-284756-0067.flac," the other two receive. when the switch is on the first contact, number one sends, and number two and three receive. when the switch is on number two, then he sends thoughts, and number one and three receive them, and so on."
5479,8088-284756-0003.flac," absorbed in my mental picture of these modern free-booters, the sudden alarm of the telephone startled me like an unexpected shot fired beside my ear. brushing the cigarette ashes from my smoking jacket, i crossed the room and snatched up the receiver."
5480,8088-284756-0021.flac," mercer, during all the years i had known him, had never been moved before to such tempestuous outbursts of enthusiasm. it was his habit to speak slowly and thoughtfully in his low musical voice, even in the midst of our hottest arguments, and we had had many of them."
5481,8088-284756-0032.flac," he laughed, an excited high-pitched laugh that irritated me in some subtle way. she was smiling and looking up into my eyes. she was very close now, within a few feet of us."
5482,8088-284756-0017.flac, just wait till you see her. i asked startled.
5483,8088-284756-0104.flac," finally, the girl trawled alone on the floor of the ocean, between great growths of kelp and seaweeds, with them looming masses of faintly tinted coral everywhere. once, she passed close to a tilted, ragged hulk of some ancient vessel."
5484,8088-284756-0043.flac," i reminded him, as he paused, apparently lost in thought. i tried to find out more about her. i put on my bathing suit and dived into the pool. well, she came at me like a shark. quick as a flash, her teeth showing, her hands tearing like claws through the water."
5485,8088-284756-0019.flac, he hurried me across the broad concrete porch and into the house. throw the cap anywhere and come on! too much amaze to comment further. i followed my friend. this was a worn-murser i did not know.
5486,8088-284756-0106.flac," but behind her darted a black and swifter shadow, a shark. like a flash, she turned and faced the monster, something she had drawn from her girdle shone paley in her hand. it was a knife of wedded stone or bone."
5487,8088-284756-0080.flac," i looked down, the girl was watching me, and there was no smile on her face now."
5488,8088-284756-0025.flac," was the empty blackness of the sky. none of the lights provided for the illumination of the covered patio was turned on, but all the windows surrounding the patio were a glow, and i can see the pool quite clearly. the pool and its occupant."
5489,8088-284756-0097.flac," a dim bluish light filtered down on the scene such as mortal eyes had never seen. all around were strange structures of jagged coral, roughly circular as to base, and rounded on top, resembling very much the aglues of the eskimos."
5490,8088-284756-0081.flac," as her face came close to my own, i became aware of the humming, cruning sound i had heard before, louder this time."
5491,8088-284756-0090.flac," i've already started, he called back, and i hurriedly don my own instrument."
5492,8088-284756-0115.flac," mercer was bending over me, speaking softly. i was watching, old man, he said gently. i can imagine what happened. a momentary psychic fusing of an ancient, long since broken link, you together with all mankind came up out of the sea."
5493,8088-284756-0099.flac," around many of them grew clusters of strange and colorful seaweeds that waved their banners gently, as though some imperceptible current dallyed with them in passing. here and there are figures move, slim white figures that stroll along the narrow street."
5494,8088-284756-0047.flac," mercer? some may have gone back? i don't get it. mercer shook his head but made no other reply until we stood again on the edge of the pool. the girl was standing where we had left her, and as she looked up into my face she smiled again."
5495,8051-295385-0023.flac," i forbear to dilate upon the war of words which was kept up for some time by these windy commanders. van puffenberg, however, had served under william the testy and was a veteran in this kind of warfare."
5496,8051-295385-0034.flac," for it came to pass that a great cloud of mosquitoes arose out of the marshy borders of the river, and settled upon the fortress of helzenberg, being doubtless attracted by the scent of the fresh blood of the swedish gorman diesers."
5497,8051-295385-0010.flac," reaching from his waistband to his chin. the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners and separating gallantly behind, so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of rimstone colored trunk breaches."
5498,8051-295385-0027.flac," and whichever had the wind in its favor would keep up a continual firing of cannon to taunt its antagonist with the smell of gunpowder. on all these points of windy warfare, the antagonists were well matched."
5499,8051-295385-0003.flac," nor through the live-long lazy summer's day chants forth his love-six-soul in madrigals. to manhood roused, he spurns the amorous flute, doves from his brony back the robe of peace."
5500,8051-295385-0032.flac," and diverted into the ladders of the hostile camps. for some time, this war of the cupboard was carried on to the great festivity and jolification of the swedes, while the warriors of fort kazimir found their hearts or rather their stomachs."
5501,8051-295385-0013.flac," with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in advance in order to strengthen his position. his right hand grasping a gold-headed cane, his left resting upon the pommel of his sword, his head dressing spiritedly to the right."
5502,8051-295385-0000.flac, and his gallant achievements on the delaware.
5503,8051-295385-0035.flac," nay, it is said that the body of jan prince alone."
5504,8051-295385-0012.flac," stuck with a gallant and fiery air over his left eye. such was the chivalric port of peter the headstrong, and when he made a sudden halt, planted himself firmly on his solid supporter."
5505,8051-295385-0037.flac," such was the famous mosquito war on the delaware, of which general van poffenberg would feign have been the hero, but the devout people of the new netherlands always ascribed the discomforture of the swedes."
5506,8051-295385-0016.flac," upon cabbages, sunflowers and pumpkins, for want of better occasion to flesh his sword. now it came to pass that higher up the delaware at his stronghold of tinneconk."
5507,8051-295385-0009.flac," which still hangs in the family mansion of the stoivisans, a raid in all the terrors of a true dutch general. his regimental coat of german blue, gorgeously decorated, with a goodly show of large brass buttons."
5508,8051-295385-0014.flac," with a most appalling and hard-favored frown upon his brow. he presented altogether one of the most commanding, bitter-looking and soldier-like figures that ever strutted upon canvas."
5509,8051-295385-0006.flac," equipping our warriors with booklers, helms, and lances, and such like outlandish and obsolete weapons, the like of which perchance they had never seen or heard of, in the same manner that a cunning statuary, a raise a modern general or an admiral,"
5510,8051-295385-0015.flac," proceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation. in the preceding chapter we have spoken of the founding of fort casimir, and of the merciless warfare waged by its commander,"
5511,8051-295385-0029.flac, governor prince at once took advantage of this circumstance and compelled them to lower their flags as they passed under the guns of his battery. this was a deadly wound to the dutch pride of general van poffenberg.
5512,8051-295385-0036.flac," was sufficient to attract the mosquito from every part of the country. for some time the garrison endeavored to hold out, but it was all in vain the mosquitoes penetrated into every chink and crevice and gave them no rest day nor night."
5513,8051-295385-0005.flac," existed in the city of new amsterdam. this is but a lofty and gigantic mode in which we heroic writers always talk of war, thereby to give it a noble and imposing aspect."
5514,8051-295385-0004.flac," and clothes his pampered limbs in panoply of steel. or his dark brow wear late the myrtle waved, where wanton roses breathed innervate love. he rears the beaming cask and nodding plume, grasps the bright shield."
5515,8051-295385-0008.flac," and prepare himself to undergo those hardy toils of war in which his mighty soul so much delighted. me think, si, at this moment, behold him in my imagination, or rather, i behold his goodly portrait,"
5516,8051-295385-0017.flac," who styled himself governor of new sweden. if history belies not this redoubtable swede, he was arrival worthy of the windy and inflated commander of fort tasmir. for master david pittus and dvree, in his excellent book of voyages,"
5517,8051-295385-0002.flac," and the rude clash of hostile arms speaks fearful prophecies of coming troubles. the gallant warrior starts from soft repose, from golden visions and voluptuous ease, wherein the dulcet piping time of peace."
5518,8051-295385-0007.flac," in the accoutraments of a caesar or an alexander. the simple truth then, of all this oratorical flourish, is this, that the valiant peter stoivacent, all of a sudden found it necessary,"
5519,8051-295385-0033.flac," daily failing them. at length the summer heats and summer showers set in, and now low and behold a great miracle was wrought for the relief of the netherlands."
5520,8051-295385-0019.flac," guzzling, deep drinking swashbucklers, who made the wild woods ring with their carousels. no sooner did this robustious commander hear of the erection of fort kazimir, than he sent a message to van poffenberg."

5648,6880-216547-0086.flac, that is what i said to the institute at the time when i presented my report on your book. i knew that they wished to proceed against you in the courts. you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance i succeeded in preventing them.
5649,6880-216547-0066.flac," i can only beg the reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our academy. while my patrons in the social and political sciences were forminating anathemas against my brochure,"
5650,6880-216547-0067.flac," who did not know me, who might even have regarded himself as personally attacked by the two-shop judgment which i had passed upon the economists, a publicist as learned as he was modest, loved by the people whose sorrows he felt."

5653,6880-216547-0096.flac, and we build henceforth upon the sand instead of on a rock. that i cannot agree to. and for that reason i have criticized your book so full of beautiful pages
5654,6880-216547-0053.flac," and what they ought to fear. the people, incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them, applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas provided that in them they get a taste of flattery."
5655,6880-216547-0098.flac, i desire also the merit of prudence. you know how deep seated is the disease under which the working people are suffering. i know how many noble hearts beat under those rude garments.
5656,6880-216547-0054.flac," to them, the laws of thought are like the confines of the possible. today, they can no more distinguish between a servant and a sophist than formally they could tell a physician from a sorcerer."
5657,6880-216547-0081.flac," do you think that one can be a robber without knowing it, without wishing it, without suspecting it? do you not admit that society in its present state, like every man,"

5663,6880-216547-0090.flac," but see to it, sir, that yearlong they do not come, in spite of you, to seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal, and that your vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some softest of the marketplace."
5664,6880-216547-0057.flac," may you, gentlemen, desire equality as i myself desire it. may you, for the eternal happiness of our country, become its propagators and its heralds."
5665,6880-216547-0077.flac," namely, that all kinds of property get too frequently abused in this world. but i do not reason from the abuse to the abolition, and heroic remedy too much like death."

5671,6880-216547-0076.flac," i cannot accept the partnership which, as far as talent goes, would surely be accredited to me, but which would compromise me in all other respects. i agree with you in one thing only."
5672,6880-216547-0062.flac," in the most formal manner, the work of the sua pensioner, as having been published without its ascent and as attributing to it, opinions diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members."

5675,6880-216547-0100.flac," you have not written directly for them. you have issued two magnificent manifestos, the second more guarded than the first. issue a third more guarded than the second."
5676,6880-216547-0052.flac," it is for you now, gentlemen, whose mission and character are the proclamation of the truth. it is for you to instruct the people and to tell them for what they ought to hope."
5677,6880-216547-0085.flac," as russo, 80 years ago, handled letters, with a magnificent and poetical display of wit and knowledge. such, at least, is my opinion."
5678,6880-216547-0041.flac, it was my duty. this blame results from the facts which i call attention to. why has the church decreed concerning things which it does not understand?
5679,6880-216547-0026.flac," that the principle of equality of conditions not being demonstrated, the ideas of the author were nothing more than hypotheses. finally, gentlemen."

5686,6880-216547-0015.flac, to what causes must we attribute the continually increasing number of suicides and what are the proper means for arresting the effects of this moral contagion?
5687,6880-216547-0006.flac," you changed this formal offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation. thanksforth i understood with how worthy and honorable a society i had to deal. my regard for its enlightenment, my recognition of its benefits,"
5688,6880-216547-0007.flac," my enthusiasm for its glory were unbounded. convinced at once that, in order to break loose from the beaten paths of opinions and systems, it was necessary to proceed in my study of man and society,"

5692,6880-216547-0038.flac," but i should be unjust, did i not distinguish between this pretended science and the man who practiced it devoted to studies both laborious and severe."
5693,6880-216547-0035.flac," has always been misunderstood. if by an infallible method of investigation i established the dogma of equality of conditions, if i determined the principle of civil law, the essence of justice and the form of society,"
5694,6880-216547-0012.flac," has already rewarded my efforts. but gentlemen, of all the masters whom i have followed, to none do i owe so much as to you."
5695,6880-216547-0011.flac," my perception of the fact that these sciences, though badly defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere, are like the natural sciences susceptible of demonstration and certainty,"
5696,6880-216547-0013.flac," your co-operation, your programs, your instructions in agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished hopes have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road. this memoir on property"
5697,6880-216547-0039.flac, entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow citizens by their knowledge and eloquence. our legists deserve but one reproach that of an excessive deference to arbitrary laws.
5698,6880-216547-0017.flac, when your committee reported that the competitors had enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of suicide as well as the means of preventing each of them. but that from this enumeration
5699,6880-216547-0019.flac," your program, always original and varied in its academic expression, became more exact. the investigations of 1838 had pointed out as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social melody"

5702,6880-216547-0037.flac, to the problems of philosophy. every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it. i have spoken lightly of jurisprudence. i had the right.
5703,6880-216547-0046.flac," in a society like ours, to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism. of what use is it to invoke an ancient sible when a muse is on the eve of birth?"
5704,6880-216547-0030.flac," can it not render it equal for all his grandchildren and great-grandchildren? if the law no longer heats the age of any member of the family, can it not by the right of heredity"
5705,6880-216547-0040.flac," and their unwarranted blunders have disgusted me. whoever knowing them, pardons them, may read them. i have severely blamed the learned christian church."
5706,6880-216547-0044.flac, i have too much neglected form and style. in vain should i have tried to do better. literary hope and faith i have none.
5707,6880-216547-0021.flac," the utility of the celebration of sunday as regards hygiene, morality and social and political relation. in a christian tongue you asked gentlemen"
5708,6880-216547-0042.flac," the church has erred in dogma and in morals. physics and mathematics testify against her. it may be wrong for me to say it, but surely it is unfortunate for christianity that it is true."
5709,6880-216547-0020.flac," the neglect of the principles of religion and morality, the desire for wealth, the passion for enjoyment and political disturbances. all these data were embodied by you in a single proposition."
5710,911-130578-0020.flac," i must have been asleep a very long time. then his son explained to him all that had happened, and gave him some food."
5711,911-130578-0000.flac," and for this the village boys with whom he played used to quarrel with him, saying, father this orphan, why do you cheat? so one day he asked his mother why they called him that name and whether his father was really dead."
5712,911-130578-0013.flac," the sight of them frightened him, and he sang. drink your fill, tiger. i shall not shoot you."
5713,911-130578-0012.flac," and climbed up a tall, salt tree. from the tree, he watched the bison go down to the water to drink, and then go back into the jungle. and after them, tigers and bears came down to the water."
5714,911-130578-0016.flac," he put an arrow through it, and it turned a summer salt and fell over dead."
5715,911-130578-0003.flac," granny, granny, open the door. i have no son and no grandchildren to call me granny, grumbled the old woman, and went to open the door to see who was there. and when she opened the door and saw him, she said,"
5716,911-130578-0001.flac," he is alive,"" said she, but a long time ago a rhinoceros carried him off on its horn. then the boy vowed that he would go and search of his father and made his mother put him up provisions for the journey."
5717,911-130578-0009.flac, but this only broke her teeth and made her mouth bleed so that the pain was worse than before then the boy jeered at her and said did you think granny that you could bite my iron bow and arrows? so sang he left her
5718,911-130578-0005.flac," and she and the boy sat up late talking together, and then they lay down to sleep. but in the middle of the night, he heard the old woman crunching away, trying to bite his bow to pieces."
5719,911-130578-0008.flac," and in truth her cheeks were badly swollen. then he told her that a good cure for toothache was to bite on a white stone, and she believed him, and the next morning got a piece of white quartz and began to bite on it."
5720,911-130578-0010.flac, and continue the search for his father.
5721,911-130578-0007.flac," but really, she had none to give. however, she only hurt her jaws biting, so that she began to groan with pain. what are you groaning for, granny?"" said the boy."
5722,911-130578-0002.flac," and he started off taking with him an iron bow and a big bundle of arrows. he journeyed on all day, and at nightfall he came to a village. there he went up to the house of an old woman to ask for a bed."
5723,911-130578-0019.flac," and then whip the body with a myrtle twig and he will come to life. so saying, the stranger suddenly disappeared, and the boy obeyed his instructions, and behold his father sat up alive and rubbing his eyes, said,"
5724,911-130578-0004.flac," you are my grandson. yes, answered he. i am your grandchild. so she called him inside and gave him a bed to sleep on. the old woman was called huti-buddhi."
5725,911-130578-0017.flac," and ran away. then the boy climbed down from the tree and pulled the dead body of his father off the horn of the dead animal and laid it down at the foot of a tree and began to weep over it. as he wept,"
5726,911-130578-0018.flac," a man suddenly stood before him and asked what was the matter, and when he heard, said, cry no more, take a cloth and wet it in the lake, and cover your father's body with it."
5727,911-130578-0011.flac," he came to a lake, and he sat down by it to eat what was left of the provisions he had brought. as he sat, he suddenly saw some cowbice and coming down to the lake. at this he caught up his bow and arrows in a hurry,"
5728,911-130578-0015.flac, and among them was one which had the dried up body of the boy's father stuck on its horn. the boy was rather frightened and sang.
5729,911-130578-0014.flac, and they drank and went away. then various kinds of birds came.
5730,911-130578-0006.flac," he asked her what she was eating. some pulse i got from the village headman. give me a little to try, he begged. i am sorry, my child. i have finished it all."
5731,911-128684-0081.flac," but if, on the contrary, these words are words of sorting. ambiguity is natural. for then, as soon as the relations of a thing are sufficiently various, it can be sorted variously."
5732,911-128684-0050.flac, are not coefficients with which experiences come to us aboriginally stamped. but our rather results of a later classification performed by us for particular needs.
5733,911-128684-0087.flac, its sensorial adjustments are my attention.
5734,911-128684-0041.flac," when clouds float by the moon, it is as if both clouds and moon and we ourselves shared in the motion. in the extraordinary case of amnesia,"
5735,911-128684-0002.flac," in opposition to this dualistic philosophy, i tried in the first essay to show that thoughts and things are absolutely homogenous as to their material, and that their opposition is only one of relation and of function."
5736,911-128684-0057.flac, are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena of our own consciousness. there are no activities or effects in nature for the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation.
5737,911-128684-0077.flac," and the purposes they subserve by their affective values in short, that their constitution in our several conscious streams as thoughts of ours is mainly ruled. desire introduces them. interest holds them."
5738,911-128684-0083.flac," the sun caresses it, and the zephyr woozes it as if it were a bed of roses. so, the disgustingness fails to operate within the realm of sons and breezes."
5739,911-128684-0049.flac," or as rigorously physical facts. so they remain equivocal. and as the world goes, their equivocality is one of their great conveniences."
5740,911-128684-0056.flac," hardness and softness are effects on us of atomic interactions, and the atoms themselves are either hard nor soft nor solid nor liquid. size and shape are deemed subjective by kantians."
5741,911-128684-0040.flac," but not ascribed correctly to the body that really moves. thus, in optical vertigo, caused by unconscious movements of our eyes, both we and the external universe appear to be in a world."
5742,911-128684-0039.flac," and doubtless passes with most readers for all right. psychologists, studying our perceptions of movement, have unearthed experiences in which movement is felt in general."
5743,911-128684-0055.flac," no one ever thought of calling these qualities subjective. when however, galileo, descartes, and others found it best for philosophic purposes to class sound, heat, and light, along with pain and pleasure as purely mental phenomena,"
5744,911-128684-0080.flac," immediately, intuitively and infallibly discernible, and each fixed forever in whatever bit of experience it qualified, one does not see how there could ever have arisen any room for doubt or ambiguity."
5745,911-128684-0012.flac," taken in this group, we call both it and them ideas or sensations. and the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of interrelation."
5746,911-128684-0058.flac," nature exhibits only changes, which habitually coincide with one another."
5747,911-128684-0079.flac," is the most natural thing in the world. it would, however, be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which i cited at the outset were correct. if physical and mental meant two different kinds of intrinsic nature,"
5748,911-128684-0024.flac," in the two cases, their contexts are apt to be different. in the case of our affectional experiences, we have no permanent and steadfast purpose that obliges us to be consistent."
5749,911-128684-0004.flac," can stand alternately for a fact of consciousness or for a physical reality, according as it is taken in one context or in another. for the right understanding of what follows,"
5750,911-128684-0009.flac," any one content such as hard, let us say, can be assigned to either group. in the outer group, it is strong. it acts energetically and aggressively."
5751,911-128684-0033.flac," make out as feelings when we take them singly. but when they combine in a total richness, we call the result the beauty of the object and treat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives."
5752,911-128684-0036.flac, where we forbidden to project words primarily connoting our affections upon the objects by which the affections are aroused. the man is really hateful. the action really mean. the situation really tragic.
5753,911-128684-0019.flac," in such a world, the mental or the physical status of any piece of experience would be unequivocal. when active, it would figure in the physical and when inactive in the mental group."
5754,911-128684-0007.flac," because i had to be so brief. i now return to the subject because i believe that so far from invalidating my general thesis, these phenomena, when properly analyzed, afforded powerful support."
5755,911-128684-0032.flac," and in sections 10 and 11 of his work, the sense of beauty, he treats in a masterly way of this equivocal realm. the various pleasures we receive from an object,"
5756,911-128684-0013.flac," the mutual impenetrability on the one hand, and the lack of physical interference and interaction on the other. that what in itself is one in the same entity should be able to function thus differently in different contexts."
5757,911-128684-0064.flac, nor does it use or significance.
5758,911-128684-0069.flac," they are not inert as regards that part of physical nature which our own skin covers. it is those very appreciative attributes of things. their dangerousness, beauty, rarity, utility, etc."
5759,911-128684-0005.flac," in our pleasures and pains, our loves and fears and anger in the beauty, comicality, importance or preciousness of certain objects and situations. we have, i am told by many critics."
5760,911-128684-0048.flac," we shall probably judge it to have been there for both. with the affectional experiences which we are considering, the relatively pure condition lasts. in practical life, no urgent need has yet arisen for deciding whether to treat them as rigorously mental."
5761,911-128684-0035.flac," an agreeable degree of heat, or an agreeable feeling occasioned by the degree of heat. either will do, and language would lose most of its aesthetic and rhetorical value,"
5762,911-128684-0070.flac," that primarily appeal to our attention. in our commerce with nature, these attributes are what give emphasis to objects. and for an object to be emphatic, whatever spiritual fact it may mean,"
5763,911-128684-0075.flac," for though, in that group, it'd be true that things do not act on one another by their physical properties, do not dent each other or set fire to each other."
5764,911-128684-0018.flac, it is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only alternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or complete inertness.
5765,911-128684-0063.flac, it does not work to assume that physical objects are going to act outwardly by their sympathetic or antipathetic qualities. the beauty of a thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon of compositions.
5766,911-128684-0043.flac, noticed and attended walk across the room. he identified the movement with that of his own. he did not yet discriminate between his own movements and those outside himself.
5767,911-128684-0037.flac," all in themselves and quite apart from our opinion. we even go so far as to talk of a weary road, a giddy height, a jokun demorning, or a sullen sky."
5768,911-128684-0090.flac," it is their way of behaving towards each other, their system of relations, their function, and all these things vary with the context in which we find it opportune to consider them. i think i may conclude then."
5769,911-128684-0000.flac," are as dualistic as it is possible to be. thoughts, we all naturally think, are made of one kind of substance, and things of another. consciousness flowing inside of us in the forms of conception or judgment,"
5770,911-128684-0045.flac," motion originally simply is. only later is it confined to this thing or to that. something like this is true of every experience, however complex."
5771,911-128684-0073.flac," that, however, is enough to save them from being classed as absolutely non-objective. the attempt, if anyone should make it, to sort experiences into two absolutely discrete groups."
5772,911-128684-0021.flac," in the paragraphs that follow, i shall try to show one that the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given as purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous. and two."
5773,911-128684-0029.flac," and we are always free to speak of them in objective, as well as in subjective terms. we can say that we are aware of a painful place, filling a certain bigness in our organism."
5774,911-128684-0042.flac, published by citus and goodheart in their important work on multiple personality. we read that when the patient first recovered consciousness and
5775,911-128684-0076.flac," they yet act on each other in the most energetic way by those very characters which are so inert, extra-corporally. it is by the interest and importance that experiences have for us, by the emotions they excite."
5776,911-128684-0011.flac," in the mind, on the contrary, the hard thing is nowhere in particular. it dents nothing. it suffuses through its mental neighbors, as it were, and interpenetrates them."
5777,911-128684-0091.flac," and i hope that my readers are now ready to conclude with me, that the pretended spirituality of our emotions and of our attributes of value, so far from proving an objection to the philosophy of pure experience, does, when rightly discussed and accounted for,"
5778,911-128684-0010.flac," here, whatever is hard interferes with the space its neighbors occupy. it dense them, is impenetrable by them. and we call the hardness then a physical hardness."
5779,911-128684-0084.flac," it does not function as a physical quality. but the carrion turns our stomach by what seems a direct operation. it does function physically, therefore, in that limited part of physics."
5780,911-128684-0023.flac," classifications depend on our temporary purposes. for certain purposes, it is convenient to take things in one set of relations."
5781,911-128684-0001.flac, or concentrating itself in the shape of passion or emotion can be directly felt as the spiritual activity which it is and known in contrast with the space-filling objective content which it envelops and accompanies.
5782,911-128684-0068.flac," why then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do, and not class them decisively as purely spiritual? the reason would seem to be that, although they are inert as regards the rest of physical nature."
5783,911-128684-0062.flac, turn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us. we soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our interests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another.
5784,911-128684-0061.flac," both rationalism and the usual empiricism claim that they are exclusively the work of the mind, the finite mind or the absolute mind as the case may be."
5785,911-128684-0086.flac," sometimes again, i think of it as mine. i sort it with the me. and then certain local changes and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings. its breathing is my thinking."
5786,911-128684-0014.flac," is a natural consequence of the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come. to her offspring, a tigress is tender, but cruel to every other living thing."
5787,911-128684-0074.flac, with nothing but inertness in one of them and nothing but activities in the other. would thus receive one check. it would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively mental group.
5788,911-128684-0026.flac," thus with these experiences, so far from being an obstacle to the pure experience philosophy, serve as an excellent corroboration of its truth. first of all, then, it is a mistake to say,"
5789,911-128684-0053.flac," into the water, which it sets a boiling. it is the very light of the arc lamp, which displaces the darkness of the midnight street, etc. by engendering and translocating, just these qualities."
5790,911-128684-0016.flac, it is absolutely inert. it is thus both energetic and inert. and the same is true if you vary the associates properly of every other piece of experience.
5791,911-128684-0059.flac," but only a translocation of experiences from one world to another. the grouping of them, with one set or another of associates for definitely practical or intellectual ends."
5792,911-128684-0066.flac," even such things as forces, tensions, and activities can at a pinch be regarded as anthropomorphic projections. so far then, as the physical world means the collection of contents that determine in each other certain regular changes,"
5793,911-128684-0006.flac," a great realm of experience intuitively recognized as spiritual, made and felt to be made of consciousness exclusively, and different in nature from the space-filling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects."
5794,911-128684-0071.flac," means also that it produces immediate bodily effects upon us, alterations of tone and tension, of heartbeat and breathing, of vascular and visceral action."
5795,911-128684-0030.flac, or we can say that we are inwardly in a state of pain. all our adjectives of worth are similarly ambiguous.
5796,911-128684-0044.flac," in which discriminations afterwards needful have not yet been made. a piece of experience of a determinant sort is there, but they're at first as a pure fact."
5797,911-128684-0089.flac, prove how hard it is to decide by bear introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either spiritual or material. it surely can be nothing intrinsic in the individual experience.
5798,911-128684-0003.flac," there is no thought stuff different from thing stuff, i said, but the same identical piece of pure experience, which was the name i gave to the material prima of everything."
5799,911-128684-0067.flac," the whole collection of our appreciative attributes has to be treated as falling outside of it. if we mean by physical nature, whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies,"
5800,911-128684-0052.flac, things act on each other as well as on us by means of their secondary qualities. sound as such goes through the air and can be intercepted.
5801,911-128684-0072.flac," the interesting aspects of things are thus not wholly inert physically, though they be active only in these small corners of physical nature which our bodies occupy."
5802,911-128684-0078.flac, fitness fixes their order and connection. i need only refer for this aspect of our mental life.
5803,911-128684-0054.flac," actively efficacious as they seem to be. we ourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us. and until more purely intellectual, as distinguished from practical, needs hath arisen,"
5804,911-128684-0031.flac," or is it a feeling in our mind? practically, we treat it as both or as either, according to the temporary direction of our thought. beauty, says professor santajana, is pleasure-objectified."
5805,911-128684-0025.flac," so we find it easy to let them float ambiguously. sometimes, classic them with our feelings, sometimes with more physical realities, according to caprice or to the convenience of the moment."
5806,911-128684-0085.flac," and conversely, of course, we must treat it as non-mental or as mental. our body itself is the pulmonary instance of the ambiguous. sometimes i treat my body purely as a part of outer nature."
5807,911-128684-0020.flac, but the universe we live in is more chaotic than this. and there is room in it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences of our emotions and appreciative perceptions.
5808,911-128684-0060.flac," i will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of relations. they are undeniable parts of pure experience, yet while common sense in what i call radical empiricism stand for their being objective."
5809,911-128684-0046.flac, at the moment of its actual presence. let the reader arrest himself in the act of reading this article now.
5810,911-128684-0028.flac, they are simultaneously affections of the body.
5811,911-128684-0034.flac, we discover beauty just as we discover the physical properties of things. training is needed to make us expert in either line. single sensations also may be ambiguous. shall we say...
5812,911-128684-0008.flac," the central point of the pure experience theory is that outer and inner are names for two groups into which we sort experiences, according to the way in which they act upon their neighbors."
5813,911-128684-0082.flac," take a mass of carrion, for example."
5814,911-128684-0047.flac," is there. and whether there for someone's consciousness or there for a physical nature is a question not yet put. at the moment, it is there for neither. later,"
5815,911-128684-0027.flac," with the objectors who might begin by siding, that anger, love, and fear are affections purely of the mind."
5816,911-128684-0017.flac," it is only towards certain specific groups of associates that the physical energies, as we call them, of a content are put forth. in another group, it may be quite inert."
5817,911-128684-0022.flac," that their impuguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that subjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is aboriginally made of, but of its classification."
5818,911-128684-0038.flac," and the term indefinite, while usually applied only to our apprehensions, functions as a fundamental physical qualification of things in spencer's law of evolution."
5819,911-128684-0015.flac," both cruel and tender therefore at once. a mass in movement resists every force that operates contrary wise to its own direction, but to forces that pursue the same direction or come in at right angles."
5820,911-128684-0051.flac," the common-scent stage of thought is a perfectly definite, practical halting place. the place where we ourselves can proceed to act unhesitatingly. on this stage of thought,"
5821,911-128684-0088.flac," it's visceral perturbations, are my emotions. the obstinate controversy is that i've arisen over such statements as these, which sound so paradoxical and which can yet be made so seriously."
5822,911-128684-0065.flac," its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands of physical nature. chemical affinities are a purely verbal metaphor, and, as i just said,"
5823,8580-287363-0031.flac," and then, when all was in readiness, he began to call his home station. he knew that either his father or mr. jackson the engineer could receive the wireless."
5824,8580-287363-0007.flac," that the colored man had had a method in his madness. on his way back through the motorroom, tom looked to the machinery, and adjusted some of the auxiliary oil feeders. the various pieces of apparatus were working well."
5825,8580-287363-0025.flac," and showing that scientist some of the manufactured diamonds, getting our wireless apparatus in shape. answer the lad, i should have done it before, but i had so much to do that i couldn't get at it."
5826,8580-287363-0021.flac," and an alarm bell would sound in his state room when anything went wrong. bless my napkin!"" exclaimed mr. dayman the next morning as they sat down to a breakfast of fruit, ham and eggs, and fragrant coffee."
5827,8580-287363-0015.flac," as he gazed at some weather instruments on the cabin wall. bless my soul, don't say that!"" cried mr. damon. what is it? i think from my observations that we will soon have a hurricane,"" said the scientific man."
5828,8580-287363-0026.flac," dad will want to know how we are doing. as he worked away, he also made up his mind to send another message, in care of his father, for there was a receiving station in the swift home, and to whom this message was addressed, tom did not say."
5829,8580-287363-0010.flac," to where he hoped to discover the secret of phantom mountain. how do you like it?"" asked tom. it's great! reply the diamond man. i've never been in an airship before, and it's different than what i expected, but it's great!"
5830,8580-287363-0027.flac," but we fancy some of our readers can guess. finally, after several hours of work, the wireless was in shape to send and receive messages. tom pulled over the lever and a crackling sound was heard."
5831,8580-287363-0035.flac," there was a look of worry meant. ""'father has just sent me a message,' he said. ""'it's a warning flash through space. he's been trying to get it to me since yesterday.'"
5832,8580-287363-0029.flac," he was ready to serve his guests before he forwarded his own wireless notes. just tell my wife that i'm enjoying myself. requested mr. damon, bless my footstool, but this is great! we're off the earth yet!"
5833,8580-287363-0002.flac, complimented mr. parker. is it always as easy as this? starting always is was the answer. though as the irishman said coming down isn't sometimes quite so comfortable.
5834,8580-287363-0003.flac," cried the eccentric mr. damon. can we all play into earth in the red cloud, tom? yes, but not as easily as in the butterfly. however, i hope we will not have to."
5835,8580-287363-0009.flac," yes, i can't imagine what made rad act that way. but i'll set the automatic steering gear now, mr. damon, and then you will be relieved. mr. janks was gazing off toward the west."
5836,8580-287363-0019.flac," and tom could not help wishing that the scientist would keep his gloomy foreboding to himself. however, the storm had not developed up to noon when tom, with mr. damon's help, served a fine meal in the dining room. in the afternoon, the speed of the ship was increased."
5837,8580-287363-0000.flac," rapidly, the airship ascended, and when it was high over the town of shopton, tom headed the craft due west. looking down, he tried to describe mary nestor in her carriage, but the trees were in the way."
5838,8580-287363-0008.flac," though the engine had not yet been speeded up to its limit. tom wanted it to warm up first. everything all right?"" asked mr. damon as tom rejoined them in the pilot house, which was just forward of the living room in the main cabin."
5839,8580-287363-0017.flac," oh, i think there will be no danger, spoke tom. if it comes on to blow, we will ascend or descend out of the path of the storm. this craft is not like the ill-fated wizard i can more easily handle the red cloud, even in a bad storm."
5840,8580-287363-0012.flac," guided by the automatic rudder so that no one was needed in the pilot house since there was no danger of collisions. airships are not quite numerous enough for that, yet, though they may soon become so."
5841,8580-287363-0016.flac," there is every indication of it, and he seemed quite delighted at the prospect of his prediction coming true. a hurricane!"" cried mr. damon. i hope it isn't like the one the bluest earthquake island!"
5842,8580-287363-0022.flac," and yet we are, how far away above the earth, tom?"" he asked, turning to the young inventor. about two miles now, i just sent her up as i thought i detected that storm mr. parker spoke of. i told you it would come, declared the scientist."
5843,8580-287363-0013.flac," tom and the others devoted several hours to arranging their state rooms and bunks and getting their clothing stowed away. and when this was done, mr. parker and mr. jank said gazing off into space. it's hard to realize that we are really in an airship."
5844,8580-287363-0018.flac," remarked mr. janks. it would be too bad to be wrecked before we got to phantom mountain. well, i predict that we will have a bad storm, insisted mr. parker."
5845,8580-287363-0028.flac," as the electricity leaped from the transmitters into space. then he clamped the receiver on his ear. already, he announced, has anybody any messages they wish sent? for with the courtesy of a true host,"
5846,8580-287363-0023.flac," that morning, but only the lower edge of it caught the red cloud. and when tom center up still higher, she found a comparatively quiet zone, where she slid along at good speed."
5847,8580-287363-0011.flac," it's the only craft that will serve our purpose among the towering mountain peaks where the diamond makers are hidden. i hope we can find them. in a little while, the red cloud was skimming along at faster speed."
5848,8580-287363-0001.flac," their interlocking branches hiding the girl. tom did see crowds of other persons, though, thronging the streets of shopton. for, though the young inventor had made many flights, there was always a novelty about them that brought out the curious."
5849,8580-287363-0014.flac," observed the diamond man. at first i thought i would be frightened, but i'm not a bit. it doesn't seem as if anything could happen."" something is likely to happen soon,"" said mr. parker suddenly."
5850,8580-287363-0030.flac," connected with it! mr. janks had no one to whom he wanted to send any word, but mr. parker wished to wire to a fellow scientist the result of some observations made in the upper air. tom noted all the messages down."
5851,8580-287363-0006.flac," looking from an after window and even going out on a small, open platform, but could discover nothing wrong. i guess rad was just capering about without any special object, mused tom."
5852,8580-287363-0032.flac," but no sooner had the young inventor sent off the first few dots and dashes representing s.i. his home station call. then he started, and a look of surprise came over his face. they're calling us, he exclaimed. who is?"
5853,8580-287363-0020.flac," and by night, they had covered several hundred miles. through the darkness, the red cloud kept on making good time. tom got up occasionally to look to the machinery."
5854,8580-287363-0004.flac," now, mr. damon, if you will just take charge of this steering apparatus for a minute, i want to go aft. what for? i wish to see if everything is alright. i can't imagine why eradicate was making those queer motions."
5855,8580-287363-0024.flac," that afternoon, tom busied himself about some wires and a number of complicated pieces of apparatus, which were in one corner of the main cabin. what are you doing now?"" asked mr. janks, who had been talking with mr. parker."
5856,8580-287363-0034.flac," gasped, mr. damon, somewhat alarmed by tom's manner. the lad did not answer it once. he was intently listening to a series of dots and dashes that clicked in the telephone receiver clamped to his left ear. on his face"
5857,8580-287363-0033.flac," ask mr. janks. my house, my father. he's been trying to get us ever since we started, but i didn't have the wireless and shape to receive messages. oh, i hope it's not too late. too late, bless my soul. too late for what?"
5858,8580-287363-0005.flac," mr. damon, who knew how to operate the red cloud, was soon guiding her on the course, while tom made his way to the rear compartments through the motorroom, with the stores of supplies and food were kept. he made a careful examination."
5859,8580-287363-0036.flac," asked mr. janks rising from his seat, the mysterious man is aboard the airship hidden away, cried tom. that's what a radicate was trying to call to our attention as we started off."
5860,8580-287364-0044.flac," and then go on before you can send any word to your confederates. we'll put you off in the most lonesome spot we can find. and i guess you'll be some time getting back to civilization. by that time, we'll have the secret of the diamonds. you never will!"
5861,8580-287364-0005.flac," he was looking from the rear-store-room window. he's the same man who called on me that time. rad remembers him very well. bless my shoes. what's to be done?"" inquired mr. damon looking around helplessly."
5862,8580-287364-0036.flac," he was in with a diamond-makers,"" said mr. janks. he was one of those who took me to the secret cave, but it will be the last time he ever goes there. how high up are we, tom? about two miles, why?"
5863,8580-287364-0028.flac," then i'll help you get it out. bless my fri in pan, but i am very fond of lobster."" exclaimed mr. damon, and his natural tones as was possible under the circumstances."
5864,8580-287364-0022.flac," the one finally adopted was that tom and mr. damon should enter the storeroom casually, as if in search of food to cook for supper. they would discuss various dishes, and mr. damon was to express a preference for something in the food line."
5865,8580-287364-0048.flac," was dropped off the airship when it was sent down to within a few feet of the earth. ""'it will take you some time to get to a telegraph office,' said mr. janks, as a package of food, and a flask of water was tossed down to the stow away."""
5866,8580-287364-0031.flac," a moment later the young inventor was bowled over as a dark figure leaped over his head. catch him, mr. damon! he cried. bless my hat, bandit! mr. damon's voice ended in a grunt. he too had been knocked down by the fleeing man."
5867,8580-287364-0002.flac, did eradicate see the man? he says he did. answered tom. the man is hidden away on board now. probably among the stores and supplies. bless my tomato sauce. exploded mr. damon.
5868,8580-287364-0047.flac," was considered a good one. three days later, in crossing over a lonely region near the nebraska national forest, farley munson, which was one of the names the spy went by."
5869,8580-287364-0000.flac," chapter 10. dropping the stole way tom's excited announcement startled mr. damon and the others, as much as if the young inventor had informed them that the airship had exploded."
5870,8580-287364-0029.flac, he and tom moved cautiously back among the boxes and barrels. they were glancing about with eager eyes. tom switched on an electric light. in the instant he did so.
5871,8580-287364-0040.flac," hidden the airship. the stores were all in then and i stowed myself away among the boxes. i had food and water so i didn't touch any of yours. and he looked at mr. damon, who seemed much relieved. and what was your object?"
5872,8580-287364-0015.flac," so unless he heard the wireless working and suspects something from that, he probably doesn't know that we are aware of his presence aboard. but why do you think he has remained quiet all this while, tom? ask mr. damon."
5873,8580-287364-0045.flac," declared the man firmly, and he would say nothing more. though by threats and promises mr. janks tried to get from him, something about the man in with him, and where the cave of the diamonds was located."
5874,8580-287364-0004.flac," but he did not answer the scientist just then. another communication was coming to him by wireless. he listened intently. father says, the lad told his companions, that eradicate only had a glimpse of the man at the last moment."
5875,8580-287364-0027.flac," i think i'd like some of that canned lobster with french dressing on,"" spoke the eccentric man. ""'that's a way in the back end of the room,' said tom an allowed voice. it's under a lot of boxes."""
5876,8580-287364-0019.flac," and while we're about it, give him a good scare when we do get him, suggested mr. janks. how, ashton, threaten to drop him overboard. perhaps that will make him tell how he happened to get in our ship."
5877,8580-287364-0049.flac, he shook his fist at those in the airship and shouted after them. you'll never discover the secret of phantom mountain!
5878,8580-287364-0024.flac," said tom. jump before he has a chance to use his gun. mr. janks and mr. parker will be waiting outside the room to catch him if he gets away from us. i'll have some ropes ready and we'll tie him up and, well, we'll decide later what to do with him. all right."
5879,8580-287364-0016.flac," probably, he wants to wait until the ship is farther out west, suggested mr. janks. then, he will be near his friends and can get help if he needs it. and you really believe he would destroy the red cloud? asked mr. parker."
5880,8580-287364-0042.flac," you must keep away from there. and if we refuse, asked tom, then you'll have to take what comes. but not from you."" exclaimed mr. janks. we're going to get rid of you."
5881,8580-287364-0037.flac," i guess that will be far enough to let him fall. when on the diamond seeker. come on, mr. damon, help me throw him overboard. you..."
5882,8580-287364-0034.flac," the cords were produced, and the man who had now ceased to struggle was tightly bound. he uttered not a word, but he smiled grimly when mr. damon remarked, i guess i'll go back in the storeroom, tom, and see how much food he ate."
5883,8580-287364-0001.flac," and was about to dash with them to the earth, the men leaped to their feet and stared at the lad. a stow away on board, cried mr. damon. bless my soul, how did he? are you sure that message is straight? asked mr. janks."
5884,8580-287364-0009.flac," that's so, cried tom. we must try to capture him. i think we had better. the lad paused, and again listened to the wireless message. father says eradicate saw the man have a gun, so we must be careful."
5885,8580-287364-0010.flac," the young inventor translated the dots and dashes. bless my powder horn!"" exploded mr. damon. we shall have to proceed cautiously then, spoke mr. janks."
5886,8580-287364-0007.flac," that man is one of my enemies. he has been sent by the band of diamond makers hidden among the mountains to spy on me, and if possible, prevent me from seeking to discover their secret."
5887,8580-287364-0030.flac," he was aware of a movement in a little space formed by one box which was placed on top of two others. the lad saw a dark figure moving as if to get farther out of sight. i've got him! cry tom, making a die for the shadow."
5888,8580-287364-0017.flac," i think that all he is waiting for is a favorable chance to clear the diamond seeker. he would destroy the craft and us too if he could prevent us from discovering the secret of phantom mountain, i believe."
5889,8580-287364-0003.flac," we must get him out at once."" declared mr. janks. i knew something would happen on this voyage. came from mr. parker. i predicted it from the first. tom thought considerable."
5890,8580-287364-0035.flac," he wasn't there long enough. well, farley munson, so it's you, is it?"" asked mr. janks, as he surveyed the prisoner. do you know him? asked tom in some surprise?"
5891,8580-287364-0006.flac," decided mr. janks with vigor. get him out and drop him overboard. drop him overboard? cryed mr. parker in horror. not exactly, but get rid of him."
5892,8580-287364-0013.flac," because a stray bullet might pierce the gas bag and damage the ship. that's so, agreed, mr. janks. well, i guess if we go at it the right way, we can capture him without any shooting. but we must talk more quietly."
5893,8580-287364-0041.flac," demanded mr. janks. i wanted to prevent you from going to phantom mountain. how? by destroying the airship if need be, but i hope to accomplish it by other means."
5894,8580-287364-0012.flac," he inquired of tom. yes, was the hesitating answer, but i don't want to use them if i can help it. not only because of the danger and the dislike of shedding blood, but..."
5895,8580-287364-0008.flac," he tried to work on tom swiss fears and frighten him from using his airship on this quest. then, when he failed, the man must have sneaked into the shed and hidden himself in the ship. we must get rid of him, or he may wreck the red cloud."
5896,8580-287364-0039.flac, how? you got a board and what your object was in coming. that's easy enough. i had been hanging around the shed for several days watching the chance to get in. finally i saw it. when that colored man went to feed his mule and i slipped in and...
5897,8580-287364-0023.flac," the box containing which was well back in the room, this would give the two a chance to penetrate to the far end of the apartment, without arousing the suspicions of the hidden man, who doubtless would be listening to the conversation. and as soon as we get sight of him,"
5898,8580-287364-0046.flac," heavily bound with ropes, the man was locked in a small closet, to be kept there until a favorable spot was reached for letting him go. mr. janks' plan"
5899,8580-287364-0021.flac," how are you going to capture him?"" asked mr. parker. if he has a gun, it won't be any too easy to go in the storeroom and drag him out. we'll have to use a little strategy decided tom. and then they discussed several plans."
5900,8580-287364-0038.flac," throw me over with the airship two miles high, are you?"" gasped the man. will you tell us what we want to know if we don't? asked mr. janks."
5901,8580-287364-0026.flac," whispered mr. damon, we'll soon find out answer tom. let's go in. they entered and in pursuance of their plan, tom and his friend talked of various foods."
5902,8580-287364-0043.flac," the man's face showed the alarm he felt. oh, don't worry,"" said mr. janks quickly. we're not going to toss you overboard."
5903,8580-287364-0020.flac," and what are the plans of the gang of diamond makers? we make it valuable information that way. i don't believe you can scare such fellows much, was tom's opinion."
5904,8580-287364-0033.flac," while mr. janks held a gun that was still smoking. we caught him, cried the scientist. anybody heard? asked tom anxiously. no, i knocked up as gun as he fired. explained mr. janks. where are the ropes, tom?"
5905,8580-287364-0018.flac," then we must get ahead of him, decided tom quietly. i have just flashed to dad a message, telling him that we will heed his warning. now, to capture the stole away."
5906,8580-287364-0014.flac," he may have heard us. i don't think so,"" replied tom. the store-room is far enough off so that he couldn't hear us. besides, the motor makes such a racket that he couldn't distinguish what we were talking about, even if he heard our voices."
5907,8580-287364-0032.flac," look out, mr. janks!"" cried tom, to warn those on guard at the door of the storeroom. there was a report of a gun, some excited shouts, and when tom could scramble to his feet and rush out, he beheld mr. parker calmly sitting on a struggling man."
5908,8580-287364-0011.flac," if he is like any others in the gang, he is a desperate man. better sneak up on him then if we can, proposed mr. parker. there are enough of us to cope with one man, even if he is armed."
5909,8580-287364-0025.flac," i'm ready as soon as you are, tom."" said the eccentric man. come ahead. they went softly to the storeroom and listened at the door. there was no sound heard, saved that mate by the machinery. i wonder if he's really here."
5910,332-128985-0021.flac," when that bushy bearded pirate was running amuck in the streets. but if he had, it is not probable that this book would have been written. he assures us that when rock was not drunk, he was esteemed, but at the same time feared."
5911,332-128985-0054.flac," and he determined to get rid of him as soon as possible. he felt himself in the position of a man who has stolen a baby bear, and who hears the roar of an approaching parent through the woods."
5912,332-128985-0012.flac," his eyebrows were enormously large and bushy, and from under them he glared at his mundane surroundings. he was not a man whose spirit could be quelled by looking him steadfastly in the eye. it was his custom in the daytime to walk about."
5913,332-128985-0052.flac," and he was very anxious that nothing of the kind should happen again. there was no great spanish force in the harbor at the time, and he did not know how many buccaneering vessels might be able to gather together in the bay,"
5914,332-128985-0039.flac," and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any. rock had plenty of wit and he used it well. there was a slave, probably not a negro, nor a native,"
5915,332-128985-0010.flac," but i do not believe it is an easy thing to frighten a child into going to sleep. if i found it necessary to make a youngster take a nap, i should say nothing of the condition of affairs and cuba, or of the persecutions of the armenians."
5916,332-128985-0087.flac, but which are necessary to make up the true character of a pirate. the historian john seems to have been very much cut up by the manner in which his favorite hero had rounded off his piratical career.
5917,332-128985-0025.flac," then there was nothing for them to do but go onboard their vessels and put out to see in search of some fresh prize. so far, rock's career had been very much like that of many other companions of the coast."
5918,332-128985-0060.flac," by allowing them to associate with such wicked companions as frenchmen. in rockman no suggestion of the kind, knowing very well how greatly astonished the french captain would be if the governor were to communicate with him on the subject."
5919,332-128985-0011.flac," this renowned pirate from brazil must have been a terrible fellow to look at. he was strong and brawny, his face was short and very wide, with high cheekbones, and his expression probably resembled that of a pug dog."
5920,332-128985-0078.flac," and they were, therefore, greatly dismayed when a party of horsemen from the town, who had made a wide detour through the woods, suddenly charged upon their rear."
5921,332-128985-0015.flac," but although he was so strict and exacting during the business sessions of his piratical year, by which i mean when he was cruising around after prizes, he was very much more disagreeable when he was taking a vacation."
5922,332-128985-0017.flac," with his cutless waving high in the air, he would rush out into the street and take a whack at everyone whom he met. as far as was possible, the citizens allowed him to have the street to himself, and it was not at all likely."
5923,332-128985-0020.flac," in his nature there was no alloy, nor moderation, nor forbearance. the appreciative esquamelling, who might be called the boswell of the buckeneers, could never have met his hero rock."
5924,332-128985-0059.flac," there is no doubt that our buccaneers would have much preferred to have been put on board the french vessel, but as the spanish governor had started his prisoners on the road to reform, he did not wish to throw them into the way of temptation."
5925,332-128985-0030.flac," but he chose to go himself, and he came to grief. no sooner did the people on the ships lying in the harbor behold a boat approaching with a big, proud, broad jawed, mariner sitting on the stern."
5926,332-128985-0055.flac," to throw away the cub and walk off us though he had no idea there were any bears in that forest would be the inclination of a man so situated. and to get rid of the great pirate without provoking the vengeance of his friends,"
5927,332-128985-0079.flac," tributor and a great many of the pirates were killed or taken, and rock the brazilian had a terrible fall. this most memorable fall occurred in the estimation of john esquimelling."
5928,332-128985-0033.flac," when the pirate captain and his companions were brought before the governor, he made no pretense of putting them to trial. buckeneers were outlawed by the spanish."
5929,332-128985-0084.flac," but this downfall of the hero simply shows that esquimelling, although he was a member of the piratical body, and was proud to consider himself a buccaneer, did not understand the true nature of a pirate. under the brutality,"
5930,332-128985-0042.flac," and the first thing he did was to bring some writing materials to rock, who there upon began the composition of a letter"
5931,332-128985-0026.flac, differing from them only in respect to intensity and force. but he was a clever man with ideas.
5932,332-128985-0019.flac," from the time he had been able to assert his individuality, he had been a pirate, and there was no reason to suppose that he would ever reform himself into anything else. there were no extenuating circumstances in this case."
5933,332-128985-0063.flac," that the captain allowed him to serve as one of the crew. rock knew how to do great many things. not only could he murder and rob, but he knew how to turn an honest penny when there was no other way of filling his purse. he had learned, among the indians,"
5934,332-128985-0043.flac," when he was coming into the bay, rocket noticed a large french vessel that was lying at some distance from the town."
5935,332-128985-0000.flac," we will pass the consideration of a regular, out-and-out pirate, one from whose mast head would have floated the black flag with its skull and crossbones if that emblematic piece of bunting had been in use by the pirates of the period."
5936,332-128985-0027.flac," he was cruising about campichi, without seeing any craft that was worth capturing."
5937,332-128985-0009.flac," this story, however, i regard with a great deal of doubt."
5938,332-128985-0023.flac," but in all the instances of ferocious enmity toward the spaniards, there has been nothing to equal the feelings of rock the brazilian upon that subject. his dislike to everything spanish arose, he declared."
5939,332-128985-0040.flac," who came in to bring him food and drink, and by the means of this man, the pirate hoped to play a trick upon the governor. he promised the slave that if he would help him, and he told him it would be very easy to do so,"
5940,332-128985-0077.flac," in a marine combat, it is seldom that a party of borders is attacked in the rear by the enemy. although on land, such methods of warfare may always be expected."
5941,332-128985-0086.flac, under certain circumstances he showed himself to have all those brave and savage qualities which esquamelling esteemed and revered. and under other circumstances he showed those other qualities which esquamelling despised.
5942,332-128985-0046.flac," or upon the town of campichi, should be taken as soon as possible after he should hear of any injury that might be inflicted upon the unfortunate man who were then lying imprisoned in the fortress. when the slave came back to rock,"
5943,332-128985-0032.flac," rock must have had a great deal of confidence in his own powers, or perhaps he relied somewhat upon the fear which his very presence evoked. but he made a mistake this time. he had run into the lion's jaw, and the lion had closed his teeth upon him."
5944,332-128985-0003.flac, that he was destined to become a most remarkable seeropper. he was offered the command of a ship with a well-armed crew of marine savages.
5945,332-128985-0066.flac," in every way, rock behaved so well that for his sake all his men were treated kindly and allowed many privileges. but when this party of reformed pirates reached spain and were allowed to go where they pleased,"
5946,332-128985-0074.flac," if they could do this, it would be an easy matter to rush upon the unsuspecting garrison, and having annihilated these, make themselves masters of the town. both their plans did not work very well. they were discovered by some indians,"
5947,332-128985-0081.flac," by agnonymously running away. the loyal chronicler had as firm a belief in the absolute inability of his hero to fly from danger as was shown by the scottish douglas. when he stood,"
5948,332-128985-0073.flac," in yucatan. and although this was a bold and rash undertaking, the two pirates were bold and rash enough for anything. rock had been a prisoner in marida, and on account of his knowledge of the town, he believed that he and his followers could land upon the coast"
5949,332-128985-0016.flac," on his return to jamaica, after one of his expeditions, it was his habit to give himself some relaxation after the hardships and dangers through which he had passed. and on such occasions, it was a great comfort to rock to get himself thoroughly drunk."
5950,332-128985-0024.flac, seems to have been that there was nothing too bad for a spaniard. the object of his life was to wage bitter war against spanish ships and spanish settlements. he seldom gave any quarter to his prisoners.
5951,332-128985-0014.flac," would probably have felt the edge of that cutlass descending rapidly through his physical organism. he was a man who insisted upon being obeyed, and if any one of his crew behaved improperly, or was even found idle,"
5952,332-128985-0028.flac," and find out whether or not there were any spanish vessels in the bay, which were well-laden, and which were likely soon to come out. so, with a small boat filled with some of his trusty men, he rode quietly into the port to see what he could discover."
5953,332-128985-0008.flac," that rock now became famous. the better he became known, the more general was the fear and respect felt for him, and we are told that the mothers of the islands used to put their children to sleep by threatening them with the terrible rock if they did not close their eyes."
5954,332-128985-0035.flac," during the time that preparations were going on for making examples of these impertinent pirates,"
5955,332-128985-0061.flac," on the voyage to spain, rock was on his good behavior, and he was a man who knew how to behave very well when it was absolutely necessary. no doubt there must have been many dull days on board ship."
5956,332-128985-0037.flac," or jumping overboard with a couple of wine jars for a life preserver, or of doing any of those ordinary things which pirates were in the habit of doing when escaping from their captors."
5957,332-128985-0002.flac," he never had an intention of being anything else. as soon as he grew to be a man, he became a bloody-buckeneer. and at the first opportunity he joined a pirate crew, and had made but a few voyages when it was perceived by his companions"
5958,332-128985-0056.flac," was the natural inclination of the governor. now rock and his men were treated well, and having been brought before the governor, were told that in consequence of their having committed no overt act of disorder, they would be set at liberty and shipped to england."
5959,332-128985-0007.flac," he could not have been more enthusiastic in his praises. and as in the arabian nights, the rock is described as the greatest of birds, so in the eyes of the bucknear biographer, this rock was the greatest of pirates."
5960,332-128985-0069.flac," not only did rock cast from him every thought of reformation and her respectable life, but he determined to begin the business of piracy on a grander scale than ever before. he made a compact, with an old french buccaneer,"
5961,332-128985-0038.flac," inside of a fortress. and if they escaped from this, they would find themselves unarmed in the midst of a body of spanish soldiers. their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them now."
5962,332-128985-0018.flac," that his visits to jamaica were looked forward to with any eager anticipation. rock, it may be said, was not only a bloody pirate, but a blooded one. he was a thoroughbred."
5963,332-128985-0075.flac," after they had landed, who hurried to morita and gave notice of the approach of the buccaneers. consequently, when rock and his companions reached the town, they found the garrison prepared for them, cannons loaded, and all the approaches guarded."
5964,332-128985-0068.flac," but as soon as they could manage it, they sailed back to the west indies, and eventually found themselves in jamaica."
5965,332-128985-0034.flac," and were considered as wild beasts to be killed without mercy whenever caught. consequently, rock in his man were thrown into a dungeon and condemned to be executed. if, however, the spanish governor had known what was good for himself,"
5966,332-128985-0076.flac," still, the pirates did not hesitate. they advanced fiercely to the attack, just as they were accustomed to do when they were boarding a spanish vessel. but they soon found that fighting on land was very different from fighting at sea."
5967,332-128985-0053.flac," it should become known that the great pirate rock had been put to death in campichi. it was an unusual thing for a prisoner to have such powerful friends so nearby, and the governor took rock's case into most earnest consideration."
5968,332-128985-0048.flac," and early in the morning he was to return as if he had been walking along the shore of the harbor. when he was to state that he had been put on shore from the french vessel in the offing, with a letter which he was to present to the governor. the slave performed his part of the business very well."
5969,332-128985-0029.flac, and had sent that mild-mannered observer into the harbor to investigate into the state of affairs.
5970,332-128985-0082.flac," come one, come all. the bushy, browed pirate of the drawn cutlass."
5971,332-128985-0070.flac," and with a large company of buccaneers, he actually set out to take a town. having lost everything he possessed, and having passed such a long time without any employment more profitable than that of shooting fish with a bow and arrows,"
5972,332-128985-0072.flac, from the active practice of this profession.
5973,332-128985-0047.flac," the letter was given to him with very particular directions as to what he was to do with it. he was to disguise himself as much as possible, so that he should not be recognized by the people of the place, and then in the night he was to make his way out of the town."
5974,332-128985-0049.flac," the next day, wet and be dragiled from making his way through the weeds and mud of the coast, he presented himself at the fortress with his letter, and when he was allowed to take it to the governor, no one suspected that he was a person employed about the place."
5975,332-128985-0041.flac," he would give him money enough to buy his freedom and to return to his friends, and this, of course, was a great inducement to the poor fellow, who may have been an englishman or a frenchman in good circumstances at home. the slave agreed to the proposals."
5976,332-128985-0006.flac," who had no sympathy with pirates, and as for esquamelling, he simply worshiped the great brazilian desparado. if he had been riding the life and times of alexander the great, julius caesar, or mr. gladstone,"
5977,332-128985-0044.flac," by the hand of rock. went on to say that if any harm should come to these brave men, who had been taken and imprisoned when they were doing no harm to anybody, he would swear in his most solemn manner that never"
5978,332-128985-0045.flac," for the rest of his life would he give quarter to any spaniard who might fall into his hands. and he, moreover, threatened that any kind of vengeance which should become possible for the buccaneers and the french united to inflict upon the spanish ships."
5979,332-128985-0036.flac," this was a branch of the business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient. if he could not get himself out of scrapes, he could not expect to be successful. in this case, there was no chance of cutting down sentinels."
5980,332-128985-0005.flac," his talents for the conduct of great pyrrhatical operations soon became apparent, and he was generally acknowledged as the head pirate of the west indies. he was now looked upon as a hero, even by those colonists,"
5981,332-128985-0071.flac," our doubty pirate now desired to make a grand strike. and if he could take his town and pillage it of everything valuable it contained, he would make a very good fortune in a very short time. and might retire if he chose."
5982,332-128985-0013.flac," carrying a drawn cutlass, resting easily upon his arm. edge up, very much as a fine gentleman, carries his high silk hat. and anyone who should impertently stare or endeavour to quell his high spirits in any other way,"
5983,332-128985-0062.flac," when he would have been delighted to gamble, to get drunk, and to run amuck up and down the deck. but he carefully abstained from all these recreations, and showed himself to be such an able-bodied and willing sailor,"
5984,332-128985-0001.flac," and his own was unknown, and the brazilian, because he was born in brazil, though of dutch parents. unlike most of his fellow practitioners, he did not gradually become a pirate. from his early youth, he was a very young and talented man."
5985,332-128985-0022.flac," but there are various ways of gaining a steam, and rock's method certainly succeeded very well in the case of his literary associate. as we have seen, the hatred of the spaniards by the buccaneers began very early in the settlement of the west indies."
5986,332-128985-0064.flac," how to shoot fish with bow and arrows. and on this voyage across the atlantic, he occupied all his spare time in sitting in the rigging and shooting the fish which disported themselves about the vessel."
5987,332-128985-0057.flac," upon the single condition that they would abandon piracy and agree to become quiet citizens in whatever respectable vocation they might select. to these terms, rock and his men agreed without argument."
5988,332-128985-0058.flac," they declared that they would retire from the buckeneering business, and that nothing would suit them better than to return to the ways of civilization and virtue. there was a ship about to depart for spain, and on this the governor gave rock and his man free passage to the other side of the ocean."
5989,332-128985-0031.flac," and with that good many more, broad-backed, hairy mariners than were necessary, pulling at the oars, then they gave the alarm."
5990,332-128985-0050.flac," having fulfilled his mission, he departed, and when seen again he was the same servant whose business it was to carry food to the prisoners. the governor read the letter with a disquieted mind."
5991,332-128985-0083.flac," who would even surrender to say nothing of running away. that esquimelling could scarcely believe that rock had retreated from his enemies, deserted his friends, and turned his back upon the principles which he had always so truce and lently proclaimed."
5992,332-128985-0004.flac," he fell in with a spanish ship loaded with silver bullion. having captured this, he sailed with his prize to jamaica, which was one of the great resorts of the english buccaneers. their his success delighted the community."
5993,332-128985-0051.flac," he knew that the french ship, which was lying outside the harbor, was a powerful vessel, and he did not like french ships anyway. the town had once been taken and very badly treated by a little fleet of french and english buckeneers."
5994,332-128985-0088.flac," and after that, he entirely dropped rock from his chronicles."
5995,332-128985-0065.flac," these fish he sold to the officers, and we are told that in this way he earned no less than 500 crowns. perhaps that many dollars. if this account is true, fish must have been very costly in those days."
5996,332-128985-0085.flac," the cruelty, the dishonesty, and the recklessness of the sea-robers of those days, there was nearly always meanness and cowardice. rock, as we have said in the beginning of this sketch, was a typical pirate."
5997,332-128985-0080.flac," who knew all about the attack on marita, and who wrote the count of it. but he had never expected to be called upon to record that his great hero, rock, the resilion, saved his life after the utter defeat of himself and his companions,"
5998,332-128985-0067.flac," they thought no more of the o's they had taken to a man in piracy, then they thought of the o's which they had been in the habit of throwing right and left"
5999,1355-39947-0057.flac, ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere. it must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce
6000,1355-39947-0097.flac," there is too much or too little of a certain mental process, and just for that reason, there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal."
6001,1355-39947-0008.flac, is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain. it is indeed a frequent symptom in paranoia and other insanities that the patient who feels abnormal organics sensations and abnormal unaccountable impulses interprets them as influences of a distant enemy.
6002,1355-39947-0017.flac," belonging therefore entirely to the purpose of view of the mind. but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purpose of view, too. as long as we discuss the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician,"
6003,1355-39947-0086.flac," yes, the artificial reinforcement of such special features would deprive education of that, which is the most essential, namely the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy."
6004,1355-39947-0068.flac," criminal. on some other objections which interests the community as such, we had to touch before, and there is no need of returning to them with any fullness of argument. we spoke of the danger, which the mental cures carry with them when they're based on any particular creed"
6005,1355-39947-0069.flac," what is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief? if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again, to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism."
6006,1355-39947-0050.flac," and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital. and yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist. we do not eliminate the moral will, but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path."
6007,1355-39947-0078.flac," the fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered, that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life, the particular church task may be pushed to the background, and that thus the church is a part of the church."
6008,1355-39947-0075.flac," even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudo-philosophy stands behind the therapeutic work, the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior."
6009,1355-39947-0011.flac," but if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life, we should give up social life itself suggestion is given wherever men come in contact in itself. it is neither good nor bad the good resolution and the bad one can be suggested"
6010,1355-39947-0036.flac," morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task. in our discussion of the mental symptoms, i reported as an illustration of the suggestive treatment of the drug passion"
6011,1355-39947-0066.flac," if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself. science has the right to make hypnotic experiments, or experiments with abnormal mental states, only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health."
6012,1355-39947-0030.flac," it is quite true that if i hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awakening the book which lies on my table, he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom. he feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and"
6013,1355-39947-0081.flac," society does not only ask where cyclical treatment can be dangerous, but asks, with not less right, whether the scheme and the method might not be fructified, for other social ends, besides the mere healing of the sick. if psychotherapy demonstrates that, for instance,"
6014,1355-39947-0000.flac," psychotherapy and the community. both the physician and the patient find their place in the community, the life interest of which are superior to the interest of the individual."
6015,1355-39947-0047.flac," these reductions of the dose were made a week apart and sometimes only two days. the worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each, which was about january 10th."
6016,1355-39947-0060.flac," the possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment, or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions, or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs, or of creating unintentionally by suggestion"
6017,1355-39947-0024.flac," profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create. more than this, they have to acknowledge it to gain a basis for their attack. just because the hypnotizer can entirely change the desires and passions, the habits and perversities of the suffering victim"
6018,1355-39947-0035.flac, is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments. to make a man fight where despair is inevitable and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers can certainly not be the moral demand.
6019,1355-39947-0090.flac," and now that, under the influence of hypnotic suggestions, but you would remain entirely untrained from mastering the next lesson. in the same way, some naughty traits might be artificially removed, but the child would not gain anything towards the much more important power"
6020,1355-39947-0058.flac, ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skillful use. to hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous if it is done by the unfit.
6021,1355-39947-0020.flac," this opposition argues as follows. hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom. whatever the patient may reach in the altered states is reached without his own effort, while he is the passive receiver"
6022,1355-39947-0053.flac," if it were really a moral demand that the will be left to its own resources and that no outside influence come to strengthen its power or remove its hindrance or smooth its path, then we ought to let the children grow up as nature created them."
6023,1355-39947-0064.flac," all that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist, as such, is not prepared to enter into medical treatment and a psychological clinic, managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine,"
6024,1355-39947-0051.flac," we have no mystic power by which our will simply takes hold of the other man's will, but we inhibit and suppress by influence on the imagination those abnormal impulses which resist the sound desires. if that were immoral,"
6025,1355-39947-0055.flac, to patriotism and religion increases the degree of suggestibility. that is the glory of life. that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures. but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion.
6026,1355-39947-0084.flac," there can be no doubt that the possibility of such remodeling activity is given, but as far as education is concerned, certainly grave misgivings ought to be felt. when we spoke of the treatment of the sick,"
6027,1355-39947-0071.flac, any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion. the intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering
6028,1355-39947-0041.flac, i finally went to the sanitarium of doctor.
6029,1355-39947-0082.flac," hypnotism makes possible the reshaping of a pathological mind. it is a natural thought to use the same power for remodeling, perhaps the lazy, or the intemperate, the careless, or the inattentive, the dishonest, or the criminal mind."
6030,1355-39947-0095.flac, but the conception of the born criminal is also only a label which is superficially used for a great variety of minds. that men are born with a brain which necessarily produces criminal actions is not indicated by any facts.
6031,1355-39947-0037.flac," the case of a morphinist. to make clear this purpose of side of the case as against the causal one, which alone and interested the physician, i may add a few features to the short report, as a typical example."
6032,1355-39947-0003.flac," one which is perhaps most often heard in popular circles results from an entire misunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed study of the process is involved. it is claimed that suggestive power, especially in the form of"
6033,1355-39947-0070.flac," that is indeed one of the central dangers of all non-medical suggestive cures, that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing, the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth."
6034,1355-39947-0043.flac," three doses of three grains a day. i took my hypodermic as directed, but on the following day i lay on the bed to exhaust it to get up even to get around the room and i could not eat."
6035,1355-39947-0032.flac," but after a long experience, i have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patient's own moral efforts. on the contrary,"
6036,1355-39947-0042.flac," when i first went to see the professor in the harvard psychological laboratory, i was using between 32 and 38 grains of morphine daily. he put me under his treatment october 6th, and that day, cut me down by hypnotic treatment to 9 grains a day, or"
6037,1355-39947-0087.flac," wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence, there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided. everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits."
6038,1355-39947-0046.flac, i was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again.
6039,1355-39947-0044.flac," the desire for the drug was something terrible. but in about four days, i got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week, seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment, and then returning to my room where i spent 22 hours of the 24 on the bed."
6040,1355-39947-0045.flac, but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day.
6041,1355-39947-0048.flac," at this time i had the worst two days of my life. i sure had whiskey, but it gave relief only for about half an hour, and then the desire was worse than ever."
6042,1355-39947-0025.flac, he seems to them a moral wrongdoer who negates the principle of human freedom. a forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist the great psychological crime. it says to the hypnotist
6043,1355-39947-0001.flac, it is an unavoidable question of how far from the higher point of view of the social mind the psychotherapeutic efforts should be encouraged or suppressed. are there any conditions which suggest suspicion of or direct opposition to such curative work?
6044,1355-39947-0009.flac," whole pamphlets have been written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations, and requests to legislatures have been made in that spirit, but the physician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the well-known phenomena of the mental disease."
6045,1355-39947-0033.flac," every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself, and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight. his own will is a presupposition for being hypnotized,"
6046,1355-39947-0077.flac," still more that is true of the healing of the sick. whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself, is indeed a problem for the whole community."
6047,1355-39947-0076.flac, the community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non-religious work. social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit
6048,1355-39947-0096.flac, the varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions. we recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new element but is characterized only by a change of proportion.
6049,1355-39947-0056.flac," and he, who by suggestion, helps the weak mind to overcome obstacles which the strong mind can overthrow from its inborn resources, works for the good of the individual and of the community in the spirit of truest morality. much more justified than such,"
6050,1355-39947-0054.flac," and not to try to suppress from without by discipline and training, by love and encouragement, the willful impulses and the ugly habits. even every good model for imitation is such a suggestive influence from without, and every solemn appeal to loyalty and friendship."
6051,1355-39947-0023.flac," no one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom, and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only. those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the"
6052,1355-39947-0034.flac," if again and again i hesitate to undertake new cases, it is just because i have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses. the joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients"
6053,1355-39947-0039.flac," in truth, it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling. he had been, for years, a slave to his passion. to quote from his little autobiography, when i realized that i was addicted to morphine"
6054,1355-39947-0092.flac," psychotherapy has its right. the feeble-minded and the retarded child, the perverse child and the emotionally unstable child belong under the care of the physician."
6055,1355-39947-0085.flac," we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms, but not diseases. in the same way, hypnotic suggestion might reinforce a single trait, but it would not reform the personality of the child."
6056,1355-39947-0072.flac," had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of mrs. eddie's science and health. from a cultural viewpoint too, suggestive therapeutics must stand the higher, the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines."
6057,1355-39947-0029.flac, but because it is an error as to the facts. such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached. they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy.
6058,1355-39947-0021.flac," his achievement has therefore no moral value. and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies, he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent. it would be better"
6059,1355-39947-0005.flac," the hypnotist is believed to have mystic power to bring any person in a distant region under his mental control, and thus to be able to carry out any sinister plans by the help of his innocent victim. all hypnotizing, therefore, ought to be interdicted by the state."
6060,1355-39947-0019.flac," draw the practical consequences of a naturalistic view of the mind, without inquiring whether or not serious interests in the purpose of sphere are injured. if there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy, it is the duty of the community to consider it."
6061,1355-39947-0027.flac," you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend. in proportion, as you deprive him of the free control and exercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend,"
6062,1355-39947-0022.flac," if there were more suffering in the world, then that the existence of the moral will should be undermined. no one ought to take such arguments lightly. the spirit which directs them is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for superficial goods."
6063,1355-39947-0059.flac," we have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister, but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology."
6064,1355-39947-0091.flac," of suppressing an ugly tendency by his own effort. all that finds its limits, where the inhibitions or obstacles in the brain of the child are too strong, possibly, to be overcome by the own good will. but in that case,"
6065,1355-39947-0015.flac, any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions. what he needs is training in firmness. the application of reinforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctor's office is even for him.
6066,1355-39947-0013.flac," their expression awakens confidence, their voice, and their words reach deeper layers of the mind. their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the antagonistic ideas."
6067,1355-39947-0016.flac," no possible source of danger. on a higher level, our objections which come from serious quarters, and which are not without sympathy with true science. in recent times, this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression. it is an objection from the standpoint of morality."
6068,1355-39947-0080.flac," that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work, but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one. but the interest of the community is not only a negative one."
6069,1355-39947-0014.flac," but the chief difference lies, after all, in the different degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such impressions. the easily-suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict. he may catch suggestions everywhere."
6070,1355-39947-0038.flac," when that man left my laboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness, you might well have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and pleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the dangerous desire for morphine."
6071,1355-39947-0093.flac," which are at his disposal. still more complex is the criminological problem. it sounds like an easy remedy for the greatest social calamity, if it is proposed simply to hypnotize the criminal and to supplant his anti-social will by a moral one."
6072,1355-39947-0065.flac, is certainly not better than a church clinic. i cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiments sake. nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind
6073,1355-39947-0052.flac, we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements. every sound respect for authority which makes a child willing to accept the advice and maxims of his elders is just such an influence.
6074,1355-39947-0073.flac, no theory of the world and of god ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effect. freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician.
6075,1355-39947-0083.flac," both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions, and social reformers have not seldom seen their wide perspectives for social movements in future times."
6076,1355-39947-0062.flac," would also be a rather poor agent of psychotherapeutic methods. but the probability is that such a physician would simply abstain by principle from all psychotherapeutic methods. his mistake only begins if, from his lack of acquaintance with the subject,"
6077,1355-39947-0007.flac," the imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency. thus, no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will. the story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public"
6078,1355-39947-0026.flac," by your own testimony, you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self-control. in proportion, as you deprive him of the power of self-control,"
6079,1355-39947-0049.flac, he was thus at every moment during the day and night in full possession of the deadly poison with which he could have fully satisfied his craving. it was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine.
6080,1355-39947-0010.flac," to be sure, well no one can be hypnotized against his will, many a person is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out the wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without willing that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own motives."
6081,1355-39947-0089.flac, i have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits such as the habit of biting the nails. a child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this.
6082,1355-39947-0067.flac," and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies. needless to say, that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as"
6083,1355-39947-0088.flac," in the form of good example and persuasions, authority and discipline, love and sympathy. that holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure. for instance,"
6084,1355-39947-0063.flac," he draws the conclusion that the method itself is undesirable, that his real preparation ought to include psychological studies we have pointed out before, and the time seems ripe for the community to urge such a reform of the studies."
6085,1355-39947-0002.flac," of course, society has to be sure that no possible misuse and damage are to result from such practice. fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly, but from very different standpoints."
6086,1355-39947-0074.flac, who does not need the strong religious reinforcement of the suggestion because he reinforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses.
6087,1355-39947-0079.flac," in imitating that which others can do just as well or better, loses the power to do that which the church alone can do. the final outcome is therefore practically in every way the same. from whatever starting point we may come, we are led to the conviction"
6088,1355-39947-0031.flac, as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way. he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book.
6089,1355-39947-0040.flac," that is coming to anyone who's a user of opium or any of its alkaloids. for the first few months, i found great relief after every injection of morphine, but soon i could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little in what sleep i got was in the daytime."
6090,1355-39947-0061.flac," injurious effects are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work. certainly, there is no physician who is not liable to make mistakes, and a physician who has never given any attention to psychology and psychiatry,"
6091,1355-39947-0094.flac," and if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized, it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion, at least in the case of the born criminal, even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached."
6092,1355-39947-0004.flac," hypnotisation. maybe secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will, a passive instrument of the hypnotist's intent. often this is coupled with telepathic fancies."
6093,1355-39947-0018.flac," no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question. as soon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community, it becomes our duty to bring the causal and the purpose of view into harmony. and it would be narrow and shortsighted simply to..."
6094,1355-39947-0006.flac," the presuppositions of such a view are, as we know now, entirely absurd. we know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer. there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism."
6095,1355-39947-0028.flac," you thereby rob him of those powers upon which he must depend for the achievement of individual immortality. but this censure, too, is entirely mistaken. not because it urges the purpose of views against the causal,"
6096,1355-39947-0012.flac," the good example and the bad can be effective. both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique. certainly, there are some persons who have a stronger influence than others on the imagination of those with whom they come in contact."
6097,3807-4923-0004.flac," frightened as she was, the prison-bred child was as much astonished at hearing convict's cheer as a fashionable lady would be to hear her footman quote poetry. bates, however, practical and calm, took quite another view of the case."
6098,3807-4923-0009.flac," leslie and another burst into a laugh at this wild proposition, but rex, who had weighed his chances well beforehand, felt the force of the pilot's speech and answered seriously. it's no use talking, he said, shaking his still handsome head."
6099,3807-4923-0030.flac," and the glimmering water was visible a white speck which gradually neared them. come alongside with ye, hildo voice, or it will be the worst for ye. they want to murder us, as fair. give way, men."
6100,3807-4923-0026.flac," and a dozen such as ye. the brig's hours can't ye see and where your master's now. fair, stifling an exclamation of rage, cried to the bow to hook on, but the bow had driven the boat backward, and she was already beyond arm's length of the brig."
6101,3807-4923-0051.flac," which is it to be. we'll go with you,"" says the man who had pulled the stroke in the whaleboat, spitting into the water with averted face. upon which utterance the convict spursed into joyous oaths and the pair were received with much handshaking."
6102,3807-4923-0038.flac," he had feared that the child was injured. by the direction of rex, the whale boat was brought alongside the jolly boat, and cheshire and leslie boarded her."
6103,3807-4923-0039.flac," flair attempted to resist this indignity, but cheshire clapping his musket to his ear, so he would blow out his brains if he uttered another syllable. flair, catching the malignant eye of john rex."
6104,3807-4923-0033.flac," but a few minutes before, would have risked his life to obey orders of his officer, did more than an hour's reasoning to convince mauree's fray of the hopelessness of resistance. his authority"
6105,3807-4923-0020.flac," that john rex was a greater man at that moment than john bates. as mrs. vickers descended the hatchway, the boat with fray and the soldiers came within musket range, and leslie, according to orders, fired his musket over their heads."
6106,3807-4923-0037.flac, and a loaded musket across his knees. the white object which had been seen by the men in the whaleboat was a large white shawl which wrapped mrs. vickers and sylvia.
6107,3807-4923-0024.flac," and poised it on the rail. their intention was but too evident, and honest bates, like a faithful watchdog, barked to warn his master. bloodthirsty cheshire caught him by the throat, and fray her unheeding."
6108,3807-4923-0027.flac," looking up, he saw cheshire's savage face and heard the click of the lock as he cocked his piece. the two soldiers, exhausted by their long pull, made no effort to stay the progress of the boat."
6109,3807-4923-0001.flac," clung to her mother with one hand, and with the other pressed close to her little bosom, the english history. in her all-absorbing fear, she had forgotten to lay it down."
6110,3807-4923-0010.flac," we have got the brig and we mean to keep her. i can navigate her though i am no semen, so you needn't talk further about it mr. bates. it's liberty we require. what are you going to do with us, hust bates? leave you behind. bates face blanched."
6111,3807-4923-0011.flac," what, here? yes, it don't look a picture-esque spot, does it? and yet i've lived here for some years, any grand. bates was silent. the logic of that grand was unanswerable. come cried the dandy, shaking off his momentary milling-colleys."
6112,3807-4923-0049.flac," and revived in the minds of the pair already disposed to break the oak that sat so heavily upon them, a train of dismal memories. the life of a soldier on a convict station was at that time a hard one. he was often stinted in rations,"
6113,3807-4923-0041.flac," fell, pinion as he was, he could not rise without assistance, and russen pulled him roughly to his feet with the coarse laugh. in his present frame of mind, that laugh called him worse than his bonds."
6114,3807-4923-0028.flac," the deck of the osprey had become invisible in the darkness. ferris stuck his fist upon the fort in sheer impotence of rage. the scoundrels, he said, between his teeth, they've mastered us. what does it mean to do next?"
6115,3807-4923-0015.flac," frightened, let me pass, prisoner. the whole deck burst into a great laugh at this, and poor mrs. vickers paused, trembling for the consequences of the child's temerity. to thus taunt the desperate convict who held their lives in his hands seemed sheer madness."
6116,3807-4923-0008.flac," fools, he cried. do you know what you are about to do? you will never escape. give up the brig and i will declare before my god upon the bible that i will say nothing, but give all good characters."
6117,3807-4923-0019.flac," your daughter has her father's spirit, madame, said he to mrs. vickers with a bow. bates opened his mouth to listen. his ears were not large enough to take in the words of this complimentary convict. he began to think that he was the victim of a nightmare. he absolutely felt."
6118,3807-4923-0002.flac," and shuddering shook her head. the men above swore impatiently at the delay, and the three hastened on deck. who's to command the brig now, asked undonted baits as they came up? i am, said john rex."
6119,3807-4923-0005.flac," the bold project, so boldly avowed, seemed to him a sheer absurdity, the dandy and a crew of nine convicts navigate a brig around the world, preposterous, why not a man aboard could work a reckoning."
6120,3807-4923-0052.flac," then rex, with lion and riley as a guard, got into the whaleboat, and having lost the two prisoners from their bonds, ordered them to take the place of russan and fair. the whaleboat was manned by the seven mutant nears."
6121,3807-4923-0018.flac," and rex dared not vent his passion on so hopeless an object. as men do in such cases, he veiled his anger beneath an affectation of amusement. in order to show that he was not moved by the taunt, he smiled upon the taunter more graciously than ever."
6122,3807-4923-0000.flac," mrs. vickers, pale and sick with terror, yet sustained by that strange courage of which we have before spoken, passed rapidly under the open skylight and prepared to ascend. sylvia, her romance crushed by two dreadful reality,"
6123,3807-4923-0035.flac," it seemed to him that virtue had gone out of it. when they reached the brig, they found that the jollyboat had been lowered and laid alongside. in her were eleven persons, baits with forehead gashed and hands bound, the stunned grimes,"
6124,3807-4923-0029.flac," the answer came pat to the question. from the dark hull of the brig broke a flash and a report, and a musket ball cut the water beside them with a chirping noise. between the black, indistinct mass which represented the brig,"
6125,3807-4923-0014.flac," run down with your mama, and don't be frightened. sylvia flashed burning red at this indignity. frightened."
6126,3807-4923-0036.flac," russan and fair pulling, lion, riley, cheshire, and leslie with muskets, and john rex in the sternsheets."
6127,3807-4923-0017.flac," the generic name of convix, made him bite his lips with rage. had he had his will, he would have struck the little creature to the deck, but the horse laugh of his companions warned him to forebear. there is public opinion even among convix."
6128,3807-4923-0054.flac," keep your distance, shouted cheshire, as fair and bates, in obedience to orders, began to pull the jolly boat towards the shore, and in this fashion was the dismal little party conveyed to the mainland. it was night when they reached it."
6129,3807-4923-0045.flac," mr. flair, purple, clumsy, and bound, was not at all heroic. now my dad says rex, who seemed to have endured the cast-off authority of flair, we give you your choice. stay at hell's gates or come with us."
6130,3807-4923-0016.flac," in the boldness of the speech, however, lay its safeguard. rex, whose politeness was mere bravado, was stung to the quick by the reflection upon his courage, and the bitter accent with which the child had pronounced the word prisoner."
6131,3807-4923-0003.flac," and with these brave fellows, i'll take her round the world. the touch of bomb-bast was not out of place. it jumped so far with the humor of the convicts that they set up a feeble cheer, at which sylvia frowned."
6132,3807-4923-0012.flac," look alive there. lower away the jolly boat. mrs. vickers, go down to your cabin and get anything you want."
6133,3807-4923-0006.flac," his nautical fancy pictured the osprey, helplessly rolling on aswell of the southern ocean, or hopelessly locked in the ice of the antarctic seas, and he dimly guessed at the fate of the diluted tin."
6134,3807-4923-0050.flac," and of necessity deprived of all rational recreation, while punishment for offenses was prompt and severe. the companies drafted to the penal settlements were not composed of the best material, and the pair had good precedent for the course they were about to take."
6135,3807-4923-0048.flac," go with him, you beggars,"" said he, and leave us honest men. oh, you'll get a tie-in up for this."" the phrase tying up brought with it recollection of the worst portion of military discipline, a cat."
6136,3807-4923-0032.flac," come, come, sir, return to soldier, sockly, this ain't the time to bully, and as for mutiny, why, when man's about as good as another just now. this speech from the lips of the man who,"
6137,3807-4923-0058.flac," great god, cried bates, running up to his knees and water after the departing boats. would you leave us here to starve?"
6138,3807-4923-0031.flac," it's no use, mr. flair, so the man nearest him. we can do no good now, and they won't hurt us, i dare say. you dogs, you are in league with them, burst out flair, purple with indignation. do you mutiny?"
6139,3807-4923-0042.flac," poor mrs. vickers, with a woman's quick instinct, saw this, and even amid her own trouble, found leisure to console him. the wretch is, she said, under her breath, as friar was flung down beside her, to subject you to such indignity."
6140,3807-4923-0044.flac," and clad in dazzling male, or, at the very least, as a muscular hero, who would settle affairs out of hand by sheer personal prowess. if she had entertained any such notion, the reality must have struck coldly upon her senses."
6141,3807-4923-0007.flac," even if they got safe to port, the chances of final escape were all against them. for what account could they give of themselves? overpowered by these reflections, the honest fellow made one last effort to charm his captors back to their pristine bondage."
6142,3807-4923-0013.flac, but i have no wish to leave you without clothes. bates listened in a sort of dismal admiration at this courtly convict. he could not have spoken like that how life depended on it. now my little lady continued rex.
6143,3807-4923-0040.flac," remembered how easily a twitch of the finger would pay off old scores and was silent. step in here, sir, if you please, said rex with polite irony. i am sorry to be compelled to tie you, but i must consult my own safety as well as your convenience."
6144,3807-4923-0021.flac," shouting to them to lay two. but frayer, boiling with rage at the manner in which the tables had been turned on him, had determined not to resign his lost authority without a struggle. disregarding the summons, he came straight on, with his eyes fixed on the vessel."
6145,3807-4923-0053.flac," rex steering, fair, russen, and the two recruits pulling, and the other four standing up with their muskets leveled at the jolly boat. their long slavery had begotten such a dread of authority in these men that they feared it even when it was bound and menaced by four muskets."
6146,3807-4923-0022.flac," it was now nearly dark, and the figures on the deck were indistinguishable. the indignant lieutenant could but guess at the condition of affairs. suddenly, from out of the darkness, a voice hailed him. hold water. back water."
6147,3807-4923-0047.flac, dimly caught the meaning of the sentence.
6148,3807-4923-0043.flac, sylvia said nothing and seemed to shrink from the lieutenant. perhaps in her childish fancy she had pictured him as coming to her rescue.
6149,3807-4923-0056.flac," this being done under the mussels of the muskets, rex commanded that baits and frair should push the jolly boat as far as they could from the shore, and riley catching her by a boat hook as she came towards them, she was taken in tow."
6150,3807-4923-0046.flac," the soldiers paused, it was a loot, to join the mutineers meant a certainty of hard work with a chance of ultimate hanging. yet to stay with the prisoners was, as far as they could see, to incur the inevitable fate of starvation on a barren coast."
6151,3807-4923-0025.flac," ran the boat alongside, under the very nose of the revengeful rex. the massive iron fell half in board upon the now-stayed boat, and gave her sternway with the splinter plank. villains cried, frere, would you swamp us?"
6152,3807-4923-0023.flac," it cried, and was then seemingly choked in its owner's throat. the voice was the property of mr. bates. standing near the side, he had observed rex and fair bringing up a great pig of iron, erstused as a part of the ballast of the brig."
6153,3807-4923-0034.flac," he was now no more than anyone else. indeed, he was less than many. for those who held the firearms were the ruling powers. with the groan, he resided himself to his fate. and looking at the sleeve of the undressed uniform he wore,"
6154,3807-4923-0055.flac," but the clear sky began to thrill with the light moon as yet unrizen, and the waves breaking gently upon the beach, glimmered with the radiant sporn of their own motion. fair and bates jumping ashore helped out mrs. vickers, sylvia, and the wounded grimes."
6155,3807-4923-0057.flac," three of chuse for old england and liberty, upon which a great shout went up echoed by the grim hills which had witnessed so many miseries. to the wretched five, this exultant mirth sounded like the nell of death."
6156,3807-4955-0010.flac," shouted to put the boat about, but he might with as much reason have shouted at an avalanche. the wind blew his voice away and emptied it violently into the air. a snarling billow jerked the orr from his hand."
6157,3807-4955-0032.flac," blent had not chosen men who were likely to betray him, though. for that matter, rex had suggested a precaution, which rendered betrayal almost impossible."
6158,3807-4955-0027.flac," blunt rubbed his eyes and stared. he looked at the man at the helm. do you see anything yonder, jim? jim, a sydney man who had never been round that coast before, briefly remarked lighthouse."
6159,3807-4955-0019.flac," being a strong and vigorous villain, however, he clung to nationlessly to his ore, and even unbuckling his leather belt, passed it round the slip of wood that was his salvation, girding himself to it as firmly as he was able."
6160,3807-4955-0017.flac," and passed over his sprawling body to the shore. cox, grasping at anything to save himself, clutched an ore, and the next moment found himself born out with the overturned whale boat by the undertow. he was drifted past his only hope of rescue, the guardboat."
6161,3807-4955-0030.flac," and then said, in tones trembling with greed, it's a fire, lie to, and lower away the jolly boat. old man, that's our bird for a thousand pounds. the pretty mary, short and sail, and bluntton staples got into the jolly boat."
6162,3807-4955-0036.flac," and this isthmus of the guarded neck was hidden by the outlying cliff. in the southwestern angle of this cliff, about midway between the summit and the sea, was an arch, which vomited a red and flickering light that faintly shone upon the sea in the track of the boat."
6163,3807-4955-0012.flac," by the recoil of the waves towards them. for an instant, all thought that they must share the fate which had overtaken the unlucky convicts, but burgess succeeded in trimming the boat, and, odd by the peril he had so narrowly escaped, gave the order to return."
6164,3807-4955-0016.flac," reached the upper portion of the shore in safety. of all this number, only cox was lost. he was pulling strocore, and being something of a laggard, stood in the way of the crow, who, seeing the importance of haste in preserving his own skin, plucked the man backwards by the collar."
6165,3807-4955-0006.flac," saw a wild waste of raging seas scooped into abysmal troughs, in which the bulk of aliviethen might wallow. at the bottom of one of these valleys of water lay the mutant years boat, looking with its outspread ores, like some six-legged in-sinked."
6166,3807-4955-0023.flac," he further said that it pricked him to breathe, cursed jimmy vetch, the settlement, and the sea, and so impenetently died. blunt smoked three pipes, and then altered the course of the pretty marry, two poisons to the eastward, and ran for the coast."
6167,3807-4955-0003.flac," and setting his teeth as he seized the ore that served as a rudder. he put the boat's head straight for the huge rock that forms a northern horn of pirates bay. save for the faint phosphorescent radiance of the foaming waves, the darkness was intense."
6168,3807-4955-0014.flac," and they knew that it was one of the shattered boat's crew clinging to an ore. he was the only one of them alive, said burgess, bandaging his sprained wrist two hours afterwards at the neck, and he's food for the fishes by this time. he was mistaken, however."
6169,3807-4955-0013.flac," as the men set the boats head to the welcome line of lights that marked the neck, a black spot balanced upon a black line was swept under their stern and carried out to sea. as it passed them, this black spot emitted a cry."
6170,3807-4955-0002.flac," knew that on the southern point of the promontory was a strip of beach, upon which the company might, by good fortune, land in safety. with something of the decision of his leader, rex, the crow determined at once that in their desperate plight this was the only measure."
6171,3807-4955-0007.flac," floating in a pool of ink. the great cliff, whose every scar and crag was as distinct as though its huge bulk was but a yard distant, seemed to shoot out from its base toward the struggling insect, a broad flat straw that was a strip of dry land."
6172,3807-4955-0008.flac," the next instant, the rushing water, carrying the 6-legged atom with it, creamed up over this strip of beach."
6173,3807-4955-0015.flac," fate had been reserved for the crew of villains a less merciful death than out of drowning. aided by the lightning and that wonderful good luck which urges villainy to its destruction, vets beached the boat and the party bruised and bleeding."
6174,3807-4955-0038.flac, stooping and rising as though feeding the fire. one might have imagined that a door in vulcan smithy
6175,3807-4955-0011.flac," despite the desperate efforts of the soldiers, the boat was world up the mountain of water, like a leaf on a water spout. and a second flash of lightning showed them what seemed a group of dolls juggling in the surf. and a walnut shell bottom upwards was driven."
6176,3807-4955-0021.flac," lower it a boat and picked him up. nearly bisected by the belt, gorge with salt water, frozen with cold and having two ribs broken. the victim of vetch's murderous quickness retained sufficient life to survive blunt remedies for nearly two hours."
6177,3807-4955-0001.flac," that nothing but the desperate nature of the attempt could have justified so desperate a measure. the perpendicular cliffs seemed to render such an attempt certain destruction, but vetch, who had been employed in building the pier at the knack,"
6178,3807-4955-0005.flac," and apparently about to be flung against the wall of rockwich, magnified in the flash, seemed frightfully near to them. the next instant, burgess himself, his boat lifted by the swiftly advancing billow,"
6179,3807-4955-0034.flac," the matter is oddly bound, i. she's a knowing one. and the sinister laughter of the pair floated across the violet water. go easy man, said blunt, as they neared the shore. they're all awake at eagle hawk. and if those cursed dogs give tongue,"
6180,3807-4955-0024.flac," it was possible that the man for whom he was searching had not been retaken, and was even now awaiting his arrival. it was clearly his duty, hearing of the planned escape having been actually attempted, not to give up the expedition while hope remained."
6181,3807-4955-0035.flac, there will be a boat out in a twinkling. it's lucky the winds off shore. staples lay on his ore and listened. the night was moonless and the ship had already disappeared from view. they were approaching the promontory from the southeast.
6182,3807-4955-0022.flac," dirling that time, he stated that his name was cox, that he had escaped from port arthur with eight others, that john rex with the leader of the expedition, that the others were all drowned, and that he believed john rex had been retaken. having placed blunt in possession of these particulars,"
6183,3807-4955-0004.flac, and burgess for some minutes pulled almost at random in pursuit. the same tremendous flash of lightning which had saved the life of mcnabb by causing rex to miss his aim showed to the commandant the whale boat balanced on the summit of an enormous wave.
6184,3807-4955-0000.flac," chapter 25. the flight. gabit, guided by the crow, had determined to beech the captured boat on the southern point of cape servile. it will be seen by those who have followed the description of the topography of colonel arthur's penitentiary."
6185,3807-4955-0031.flac," go on a hoister in, sir, said one of the crew with a grin, as blunt through a bundle into the stern sheets. staples thrust his tongue into his cheek. the object of the voyage was now pretty well understood among the carefully picked crew."
6186,3807-4955-0026.flac," stood off a little across the mouth of pirates bay. he was walking the deck, groaning at the folly of the expedition, when a strange appearance on the southern horn of the bay made him come to a sudden halt. there was a furnace blazing in the bowels of the mountain."
6187,3807-4955-0028.flac," blunt stumped into the cabin and got out his charts. no lighthouse was laid down there, only a mark like an anchor and a note. remarkable hole at this point. a remarkable hole indeed."
6188,3807-4955-0020.flac," in this condition, plus a swoon from exhaustion, he was described by the helmsman of the pretty mary, a few miles from cape serville, at daylight next morning."
6189,3807-4955-0039.flac," and that the old hero was forging arms for a demigod. blunt turned pale. it's no mortal, he whispered. let's go back. and what will madame say, returned daredevil will staples, who had have plunged into mount urbis, had he been paid for it?"
6190,3807-4955-0029.flac," a remarkable lime kiln would have been more to the purpose. blunt called up his mate, william staples, a fellow whom sarah perfoy's gold had bought body and soul. william staples looked at the waxing and waning glow for a while."
6191,3807-4955-0018.flac," with the velocity that forbade all attempts at rescue. and almost before the poor scoundrel had time to realize his condition, he was in the best possible way of escaping the hanging that his comrades had so often humorously prophesied for him."
6192,3807-4955-0009.flac," appeared to stoop down over the ocean, and as it stooped, the billow rolled onwards, the boat glided down into the depths, and the whole phantasmagoria was swallowed up in the tumultuous darkness of the tempest. burgess, his hair bristling with terror,"
6193,3807-4955-0025.flac," the pretty mary, hugging the coast as closely as she dared, crawled in the thin brigies all day and saw nothing. it would be madness to land at cape surville, for the whole station would be on the alert, so blunt as night was falling."
6194,3807-4955-0033.flac," clothes returned blunt. we can't bring him off if it is him in his canneries. he puts on these duds, you see, sinks her majesty's livery and comes aboard a shipwrecked mariner. that's well thought of, who's no since that?"
6195,3807-4955-0037.flac," the light was lambed and uncertain, now sinking almost into insignificance, and now leaping up with a fierceness that caused a deep glow to throb in the very heart of the mountain. sometimes a black figure would pass across this gigantic furnace mount."
6196,7859-102519-0031.flac," the boat weathered the storm and justinian survived to carry out his cruel oath. he came ashore in the land of the bulgarians, and soon won favour with their king terrible, who wanted a good excuse for invading the empire."
6197,7859-102519-0016.flac," and banished him to cherson. the adotus and stefanas, he handed over to the mob, who dragged them round the city and burnt them alive."
6198,7859-102519-0039.flac, and put out the eyes of the patriarch who had crowned him. then he set to work to hunt out meaner victims. many prominent citizens of constantinople were sewn up in sacks and drowned in the boss for us. soldiers were picked out by the dozen and beheaded.
6199,7859-102519-0040.flac," a special expedition was sent by sea to sack charsen, the city of the emperor's exile, because he had a grudge against its citizens. the chief men were caught and sent to the capital, where justinian had them bound to spits and roasted."
6200,7859-102519-0054.flac," with every expectation of success, when at last they appeared the man, who was destined to save the east roman empire from a premature dismemberment."
6201,7859-102519-0028.flac," and then calling on the second cazar served him in the same fashion, before the cons orders had been divulged to anyone. this gave him time to escape, and he fled in a fishing boat out into the yook scene, with a few friends and servants who had followed him into exile."
6202,7859-102519-0032.flac," and founded in the pretense of supporting the exiled monarch. with a bulgarian army at his back, just indian appeared before constantinople."
6203,7859-102519-0019.flac, where the romans had still maintained themselves by hard fighting.
6204,7859-102519-0014.flac, and rushing to the state prison at the head of a few friends broke it open and liberated some hundreds of political prisoners. a mob joined him. he seized the cathedral of saint sophia.
6205,7859-102519-0034.flac," so justinian recovered his throne without fighting, for the people had by this time half forgotten his tyranny, and regretted the rule of the house of heraklius. but they were soon to find out that they had erred in submitting to the exile."
6206,7859-102519-0033.flac," there was no fighting for the adherence of tiberius, whereas unready to strike a blow for their master."
6207,7859-102519-0050.flac," after compelling him to take holy orders. meanwhile, the organization of the empire was visibly breaking up. the affairs both of the realm and the city were neglected and decaying. civil education was disappearing and military discipline dissolved."
6208,7859-102519-0015.flac, no one would fight for justinian who was caught and brought before the rebel leader in company with his two odious ministers.
6209,7859-102519-0027.flac," the emperor learned of the plot through his wife, and saved himself by the bold expedient of going at once to one of the two kazar chiefs, and asking for a secret interview. when they were alone he fell on him and strangled him."
6210,7859-102519-0013.flac," and bade him save himself by a bold stroke. if he would aim a blow at justinian, he would find the people and the army ready to follow him."
6211,7859-102519-0052.flac, with the express purpose of laying siege to constantinople. no one hindered him for the army raised to serve against him.
6212,7859-102519-0044.flac, the six years which followed were purely an article. justinian's wild and wicked freaks had completed the demoralization which had already set in before his restoration. everything in the army in the state was completely disorganized in out of gear.
6213,7859-102519-0022.flac," the people and army were out of hand. the ephemeral emperor could count on no loyalty, and any shock was sufficient to upset his precarious throne. we must now turn to the banish justinian."
6214,7859-102519-0018.flac," the azeatic frontier was ravaged by the armies of abd al-malik, and at the same time a great disaster befell the western half of the empire."
6215,7859-102519-0056.flac," to raise the siege of amorium, leo disowned his allegiance to the incapable theodotus and marched toward the bosphorus. the unfortunate emperor, who had not coveted the throne he occupied, nor much desired to retain it,"
6216,7859-102519-0036.flac," as he tried to flee into asia. just indian had them led round the city in chains, and then bound them side by side before his throne in the kathisma, the imperial box at the hippodrome."
6217,7859-102519-0020.flac, his troops gained several victories over the serisans.
6218,7859-102519-0007.flac," the accountant general, and ex-abbat who had deserted his monastery, and the unix-de-phonus, the keeper of the privy purse. these men were to justinian what ralph flambard was to william rufus,"
6219,7859-102519-0029.flac," while they were out at sea, a storm arose, and the boat began to fill. one of his companions cried to justinian to make his peace with god, and pardon his enemies, heir he died. but the emperor's stern soul was not bent by the tempest."
6220,7859-102519-0047.flac," in less than two years, he was upset by a conspiracy."
6221,7859-102519-0023.flac," who had been sent into exile with his nose mutilated. he had been transported to chersen, the greek town in the crimea, close to the modern sebastopol, which formed the northernmost outpost of civilization."
6222,7859-102519-0051.flac, and every year their ravages penetrated further inland.
6223,7859-102519-0009.flac," staphonus, thrashed and stoned everyone who fell into his hands. he is reported to have actually administered a whipping to the empress dowager during the absence of her son, and justinian did not punish him when he returned."

6341,2836-5355-0042.flac," don't i know it? have i not said so?"" she sharply interrupted, and then she sat, striving to calm herself, clasping together her shaking hands. well, if you will persist in this perverse resolution, i cannot mend it."
6342,2836-5355-0046.flac," i wish you a good day. so you will not even shake hands with me, isabelle. i would prefer not. and thus they parted. sir francis left the room, but not immediately the house. he went into a distant apartment."
6343,2836-5355-0018.flac," whose fits of ill-temper were under no control, and who never, when in them, cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another. the temptation to sin, as you call it, lay not in my persuasions half so much, as in your jealous anger toward your husband."
6344,2836-5355-0010.flac," well, isabelle, you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman. the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks, but her voice sounded calm as before."
6345,2836-5355-0003.flac," then i found myself overwhelmed with business, and away from it i could not get. even now i can only remain with you a couple of days, for i must hasten back to town."" she said, after hearing him calmly to the end."
6346,2836-5355-0012.flac, and saw an infant's cradle by the side of the bed. he did not take the trouble to look at it. i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronet see resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words.
6347,2836-5355-0002.flac," when you left in july, you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage. you know what i mean when i say in time, but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise. he interrupted, but no sooner had i set my foot in london."
6348,2836-5355-0022.flac," her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone. her face was more flush than it had been throughout the interview. he spoke quietly now, quite in an equal tone of reasoning. it was his way when the ill-temper was upon him."
6349,2836-5355-0030.flac," outwardly into calmness again. what else? reported sir francis, you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel, and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me"
6350,2836-5355-0009.flac," would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason. her heart beat a little quicker, but she still did. you deemed that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison? he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time."
6351,2836-5355-0015.flac," if you have taken this aversion to me, it cannot be helped."" he coldly said, inwardly congratulating himself, let us not doubt, at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated. you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation."
6352,2836-5355-0021.flac," and i say i think you are on the wrong scent. i do not believe mr. carlisle ever thought of the girl in that way. what do you mean, she gasped? they had a secret between them, not of love, a secret of business, and those interviews they had together"
6353,2836-5355-0020.flac," i do not understand what you would imply,"" she said, drawing her shawl around her with a fresh shiver. how on the wrong scent? with regard to your husband and that hair girl, you were blindly outrageously jealous of him. go on."
6354,2836-5355-0028.flac," was her icy answer. let's see, how old is he now? he was born on the last day of august. sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him, then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes."
6355,2836-5355-0016.flac," she shook her head. all the reparation in your power to make, all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin. it and the effects must lie upon me forever. oh, sin was the derisive exclamation."
6356,2836-5355-0000.flac," settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction. to speak and act, let there be plain truth between us at this interview if there never has been before. i don't understand you. naked truth, unglossed over."
6357,2836-5355-0007.flac," he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask. but he was an ill-tempered man, and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now. lady isabel continued."
6358,2836-5355-0013.flac," and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay interrupted lady isabel. you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses. had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife, were you to propose to do so this day?"
6359,2836-5355-0001.flac," she pursued, bending her eyes, determinedly upon him. it must be. with all my heart, rejoin sir francis, it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind."
6360,2836-5354-0031.flac," you may drop that odious title, isabelle, which has stuck to me too long. i own a better now. what won, pray? you can look and see. lady isabelle took up the letter and read it. her friends swallowed down his coffee and rang the haze."
6361,2836-5354-0029.flac," on your favoring us with instructions, and we remain, sir, most faithful yours, moss and grab. sir francis levison barked. the outside of the letter was superscribed as the other, f. levison s. quire."
6362,2836-5354-0011.flac," it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings, and she knew that her whole future existence, whether spent with that manner without him, would be a dark course of knowing retribution. nearly a year went by, saved some six or eight weeks,"
6363,2836-5354-0042.flac," scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and the tray once her francis levisin appeared equipped for traveling. good-bye isabel said he, without further circumlocution or ceremony."
6364,2836-5354-0022.flac," last out a whole ten months, your egregious error complements the very opposite to honey and sweetness have generally superveined long before. try it if you don't believe me. two letters she continued."
6365,2836-5354-0001.flac," taking one absence with the other, he had been away from her, chiefly in paris, pursuing his own course and his own pleasure. how fair did it with lady isabel? just as it must be expected to fare and does fare, we're going to be able to see her in the future."
6366,2836-5354-0014.flac, misery marks the countenance worse than sickness. her face was white and worn. her hands were thin. her eyes were sunken and surrounded by a black circle. care was digging caves for them.
6367,2836-5354-0053.flac," the girl departed, closing the door, and lady isabelle sat looking at it, schooling her patients. another moment, and it was flung open. sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in. she waved him off, begging him,"
6368,2836-5354-0047.flac," and white and sleedy and sloppy. the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets were unusually black and the people crept along especially dismal. close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom,"
6369,2836-5354-0004.flac," she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror, from which there was never more any escape, never more, never more. the very instant, the very night of her departure, she awoke to what she had done, the guilt,"
6370,2836-5354-0041.flac, where is pierre? malady asks.
6371,2836-5354-0006.flac," lady, wife, mother, should you ever be tempted to abandon your home, so will you awake. whatever trials may be the lot of your married life, though they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature"
6372,2836-5354-0038.flac," nothing can repair the injury. if you want to suffer it to come upon him, he will be a byword amidst men throughout his life. you had better have written to the law, lords, to urge on the divorce. he returned. i cannot help the delay."
6373,2836-5354-0003.flac," when instead of the garden of roses, it had been her persuaders' pleasure to promise her she would fall in, too. but which in truth she had barely glanced at, for that had not been her moving motive?"
6374,2836-5354-0000.flac," nearly a year went by, lady isabel carlisle had spent it on the continent, that refuge for such fugitives. now moving about from place to place with her companion, now stationary and alone. quite half the time."
6375,2836-5354-0012.flac," furnished in the vicinity of the plask grenette. a windy old house it was, full of doors and windows, chimneys and cupboards, and he said he should remain there. lady isabel remonstrated."
6376,2836-5354-0046.flac," you will wait. i cannot wait,"" he replied, his tone changing to one of determination. it is useless to urge it. he broke from her and left the room, and in another minute had left the house, pierre attending him. a feeling, a mounting to a conviction,"
6377,2836-5354-0007.flac," the endurance of woman to bear, resolve to bear them, fall down upon your knees, and pray to be enabled to bear them. pray for patience. pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape. bear until death."
6378,2836-5354-0045.flac, you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us the instant news of the divorce shall arrive.
6379,2836-5354-0013.flac," she wished to go farther on, where they might get quicker news from england. but her will now was as nothing. she was looking like the ghost of her former self. talk of her having looked ill when she took the voyage over the water with mr. carlisle. you should have seen her now."
6380,2836-5354-0008.flac," rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience, for be assured that the alternative, if you do rush on to it, will be found worse than death. poor thing. poor lady isabel. she had sacrificed husband, children,"
6381,2836-5354-0032.flac," table-hand bell, the only bell you generally meet within france. pierre answered it. put me up a change of things, said he and french, i start for england in an hour. it is very well, pierre responded and departed to do it."
6382,2836-5354-0019.flac," in seeking a divorce, and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected. she was anxious for it. anxious that captain levison should render her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child."
6383,2836-5354-0020.flac," little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation, any more than he had made it to others who had gone before her. she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man, for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself,"
6384,2836-5354-0030.flac," at last, thank the pigs, was the gentleman's euphonious expression as he tossed the letter open on the breakfast table. the divorce is granted, feverishly uttered lady isabel. he may no reply but seated himself to breakfast."
6385,2836-5354-0033.flac," lady isabel waited till the man was gone and then spoke, a faint flush of emotion in her cheeks. you do not mean what you say. you will not leave me yet. i cannot do otherwise, he answered. there's a mountain of business to be attended to."
6386,2836-5354-0015.flac," a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health. she knew better, knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart. it was very late for breakfast, but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day?"
6387,2836-5354-0039.flac," there has been no delay quite the contrary, but it may be expected hourly now. you are worrying yourself for nothing, isabel, i shall be back in time."" he quitted the room as he spoke, and lady isabel remained in it, the image of despair."
6388,2836-5354-0035.flac," you might not be back in time. in time for what? oh, how can you ask? she rejoined in a sharp tone of reproach. you know too well. in time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear. i shall chance it."
6389,2836-5354-0027.flac," sir, after sending off our last dated today, we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison, your grand uncle. he expired this afternoon in town where he had come for the benefit of medical advice."
6390,2836-5354-0016.flac," langwadly, she took her seat at the table, just as captain levison's servant, a frenchman, whom he had engaged in paris, into the room with two letters. point de gazette pierre?"
6391,2836-5354-0023.flac," and they are both in the same handwriting, your solicitors, i believe. up went his hand at the last word, and he made a sort of grab at the letters, stuck to the farthest window, opened it, and glanced over its contents. sir."
6392,2836-5354-0037.flac," now, don't put yourself in a fever, isabelle. how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you? it does no good. is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england? have you no pity for your child? she urged an agitation."
6393,2836-5354-0017.flac," and all the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket, but he was only obeying the orders of his master. it had been captain levison's recent pleasure that the newspaper should not be seen by lady isabel until he had overlooked them."
6394,2836-5354-0051.flac, that my lady would soon get about if she would only rouse herself. she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it.
6395,2836-5354-0021.flac," the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest lovins in domestic privacy. he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy, and she as apathetically answered to it. piers' there are some letters, he began."
6396,2836-5354-0034.flac," besides, i should not choose for the old man's funeral to take place without me."
6397,2836-5354-0028.flac, we have much pleasure in congratulating you upon your accession to the title and a states and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present. we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you.
6398,2836-5354-0049.flac," and she shook and shivered perpetually, though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting. and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and the crackling logs."
6399,2836-5354-0050.flac," she had had a long illness, terminating in a low fever."
6400,2836-5354-0054.flac," in a subdued, quiet tone not to draw too near, as any little excitement made her faint now. he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot, as he explained that he really could not get away from town before."
6401,2836-5354-0036.flac," coolly observed surferences. chancet, chance the legitimacy of the child? you must assure that before all things."
6402,2836-5354-0040.flac, nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed.
6403,2836-5354-0005.flac," whose aspect had been shunned in the perspective, assumed at once its true frightful color, the blackness of darkness, and a lively remorse, a never-dying anguish, took position of her soul forever. o, reader, believe me!"
6404,2836-5354-0052.flac," had he come? who is it? she asked of the nurse. malady it is misha, and pierre is with him. i have beg malady often and often not to fret, from his sure would surely come, malady. see, i am right."
6405,2836-5354-0009.flac," reputation, home, all that makes life a value to woman. she had forfeited her duty to god and deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison."
6406,2836-5354-0048.flac," full of windows and doors and drafts, with its wide hearth and its wide chimney, into which we could put four or five of our english ones, shivered lady isabelle vane. she had an invalid cap on, and a thick woolen invalid shell,"
6407,2836-5354-0026.flac, news of the divorce i mean. tush was the response of captain levison. as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a far off affair.
6408,2836-5354-0044.flac," how can you be so alarmed, isabelle? of course i have. he continued in a pee-vish-tho-kind tone as he took hold of her hands to razor. no, not yet. i will remain here until you say you will wait another day or two."
6409,2836-5354-0025.flac," it was over then, and all claimed to the name of carlisle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabelle forever. captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket. is there any news? she asks."
6410,2836-5354-0010.flac," but the instant the step was irrevocable, the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance sit in. even in the first days of her departure, in the fleeting moments of abandonment, when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience."
6411,2836-5354-0024.flac," we beg to inform you that the suit carlisle versus carlisle is at an end. the divorce was pronounced without opposition. according to your request, we hasten to forge you the earliest intimation of the fact. we are sir, faithfully yours, moss and grab."
6412,2836-5354-0043.flac," lady isabelle, excited beyond all self-control, slip the boat to the door and half-leaning against it, half-leaning at his feet, held up her hand in supplication. francis, have you any consideration left for me, any in the world?"
6413,2836-5354-0002.flac," when a high principal general woman falls from her pedestal, never had she experienced a moment's calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home. she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion."
6414,2836-5354-0018.flac," you will speedily gather his motive. pierre departed through captain levison's room, and lady isabel took up the letters and examined their superscription with interest. it was known to her that mr. carlisle had not lost a moment."
6415,625-132112-0015.flac," i says, look up. if you don't look up, you can't get up."" remarch jackson philosophically, and he's gotten up. dark carter's neat barns would do credit to new england. his master helped him to get a start."
6416,625-132112-0013.flac, the planters are in debt to the merchants. the tenants owe the planters and laborers bow and bend beneath the burden of it all. here and there a man has raised his head above these murky waters.
6417,625-132112-0052.flac," we passed the months in place, where a plucky white widow is renting and struggling, and the eleven hundred acres of the senate plantation, with its negro overseer."
6418,625-132112-0018.flac," so he moved here, where the rent is higher, the land poorer, and the owner inflexible. he rents a $40 mule for $20 a year, poor lad, a slave at $22. this plantation owned now by a foreigner"
6419,625-132112-0024.flac," 20 years, yonder's sunken-cheeked old black man has labored under that system, and now turned day-laborer is supporting his wife and boarding himself on his wages of $1.5 a week. received only part of the year."
6420,625-132112-0049.flac," for paa willis was the tall and powerful black moses who led the negroes for a generation and led them well. he was a baptist preacher, and when he died, 2,000 black people followed him to the grave. and now they preach his funeral sermon each year."
6421,625-132112-0039.flac," that the concern soon landed in an extricable bankruptcy. nobody lives in the old house now, but a man comes each winter out of the north and collects his high rents. i know not which are the more touching, such old empty houses."
6422,625-132112-0014.flac, we passed one fenced stock farm with grass and grazing cattle that looked very home-like after endless corn and cotton. here in there are black freeholders. there is the gaunt dull black jackson with his hundred acres.
6423,625-132112-0023.flac," should bind her own to sloth and misfortune as ruthlessly as ever england did. the poor land groans with its birth pains, and brings forth scarcely a hundred pounds of cotton to the acre, where fifty years ago,"
6424,625-132112-0045.flac," then, too, there are fewer signs of a romantic past and more of systematic modern land grabbing and money-gidding. white people are more in evidence here."
6425,625-132112-0040.flac," or the homes of the master's sons. sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those white doors. tales of poverty, of struggle, of disappointment, a revolution such as that of sixty-three is a terrible thing."
6426,625-132112-0056.flac," it was one of those scenes one cannot soon forget. a wide, low little house whose motherly roof reached over and sheltered a snug little porch. there we sat, after the long, hot drive, drinking cool water."
6427,625-132112-0010.flac," we see on all sides within the circle of dark forest a land of canaan. here and there are tales of projects for money-gidding, born in the swift days of reconstruction."
6428,625-132112-0034.flac," here and there we meet distinct characters quite out of the ordinary. one came out of a piece of newly cleared ground, making a wide detour to avoid the snakes. he was an old, hollow, cheeked man, with a drawn,"
6429,625-132112-0031.flac, and we passed on. now sears
6430,625-132112-0005.flac," five miles below here is a town owned and controlled by one white new englander. he owns almost a rhode island county, with thousands of acres and hundreds of black laborers."
6431,625-132112-0048.flac," but the owner will not sell off a few acres. two children, a boy and a girl, are hoeing sturdily in the fields on the farm where corlus works. he is smooth-faced and brown and is fencing up his pigs."
6432,625-132112-0043.flac," but the window-pains were gone, the pillars were warm-eaten, and the moss-growing roof was falling in. half curiously, i peered through the unhinged door and saw where, on the wall, across the hall."
6433,625-132112-0016.flac," but when the black man died last fall, the master's sons immediately laid claim to the estate. and then white folks will get it too,"" says my yellow gossip. i turn from these well-tended acres with a comfortable feeling that the negro is rising."
6434,625-132112-0028.flac," and still having nothing. to be sure, he had given four children a common school training, and perhaps if the new fence law had not allowed unfenced crops in west dirty, he might have raised a little stock and kept ahead."
6435,625-132112-0012.flac," the solemn pines have disappeared, and this is the oaky woods, with its wealth of hickories, beaches, oaks and polmetos. but a pall of debt hangs over the beautiful land. the merchants are in debt to the wholesalers."
6436,625-132112-0021.flac," but not until one of the fairest regions of the okie woods had been ruined and ravished into a red waste, out of which only a yankee or an immigrant could squeeze more blood from dead cursed tenants. no wonder that luke black"
6437,625-132112-0047.flac," the returns of the farmer are too small to allow much for wages, and yet he will not sell off small farms. there is the negro, sanford. he has worked fourteen years as overseer on the ladsen place, and..."
6438,625-132112-0004.flac, there is a store conducted by his black son.
6439,625-132112-0037.flac," but a white man loaned me another, then he added, eyeing us."
6440,625-132112-0011.flac," improvement companies, wine companies, mills and factories, most failed and foreigners fell air. it is a beautiful land this d'arty west of the flint. the forests are wonderful."
6441,625-132112-0009.flac," and they, not because they are guilty, but because the state needs criminals to eke out its income by their forced labor. immigrants are heirs of the slave barren in doherty, and as we ride westward by wide stretching cornfields and stubby orchards of peach and pear,"
6442,625-132112-0042.flac," i remember wheeling around a bend in the road. beside a graceful bit of forest and a singing brook, a long low house faced us, with porch and flying pillars, great oak and door, and a broad lawn shining in the evening sun."
6443,625-132112-0003.flac," and yonder in the field is her dark, young husband, hoeing to support her at thirty cents a day without bored. across the way is gatesby, brown and tall, lord of two thousand acres, shrewdly one and hild."
6444,625-132112-0006.flac," their cabins look better than most, and the farm with machinery and fertilizers is much more business like than any in the county, although the manager drives hard bargains in wages. when now we turn and look five miles above,"
6445,625-132112-0033.flac," couldn't afford books and clothes, and couldn't spare their work. there go part of them to the fields now. three big boys astride mules and a strapping girl with bare brown legs."
6446,625-132112-0019.flac," was a part of the famous bolton estate. after the war, it was for many years worked by gangs of negro convicts, and black convicts then were even more plentiful than now. it was a way of making negro's work, and the question of guilt was a minor one."
6447,625-132112-0046.flac," and there were fences and meadows here and there. most of this land was poor, and beneath the notice of the slave-barren before the war, since then his poor relations and foreign immigrants have seized it."
6448,625-132112-0020.flac," hard tales of cruelty and mistreatment of the chained freemen are told, but the county authorities were deaf until the free labor market was nearly ruined by wholesale migration. then they took the convicts from the plantations."
6449,625-132112-0007.flac," there on the edge of town, or five houses of prostitutes, two of blacks and three of whites. and in one of the houses of the whites, a worthless black boy was harbored two openly two years ago. so he was hanged for rape."
6450,625-132112-0051.flac," a great broad-shouldered handsome black man, intelligent and jovial, 650 acres he owns and has eleven black tenants, a neat and tidy home nestled in a flower garden, and a little store stands beside it."
6451,625-132112-0000.flac," this was indeed the egypt of the confederacy. the rich granary once potatoes and corn and cotton poured out to the famished and ragged confederate troops, as they battled for a cause lost long before 1861."

6577,7278-104730-0038.flac, february 14th in the same year was a field day in the petition campaign. he presented then no less than 350 petitions. obit 3 or 4 of which bore more or less

6579,7278-104730-0020.flac," mr. adams had a support among the people at large, fastly greater than he could have enjoyed as the opponent of slavery. as his adversaries had shaped the issue, he was pretty destined to victory in a free country."

6582,7278-104730-0013.flac," mr. adams again presented two petitions for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia. but without giving rise to much excitement, the..."
6583,7278-104730-0030.flac," i have gone, he said, as far upon this article, the abolition of slavery, as the public opinion of the free portion of the union will bear."
6584,7278-104730-0021.flac," having constituted a vote. mr. adams called attention to the omission. the clerk, by direction of the speaker, thereupon called his name."
6585,7278-104730-0031.flac," and so far that scarcely a slave holding member of the house dares to vote with me upon any question. i have, as yet been thoroughly sustained by my own state, but one step further, and i hazard my own standing and influence there."
6586,7278-104730-0032.flac," my own final overthrow and the cause of liberty itself for an indefinite time, certainly for more than my remain of life. were there in the house one member capable of taking the lead in this cause of universal emancipation?"
6587,7278-104730-0042.flac, and presented another petition. he did not dare tell me.
6588,7278-104730-0037.flac," all laid on the table. january 15th he presented 50 more. january 28th he received 31 petitions and spent that day and the next in assorting and filing these and others which he previously had, amounting in all to 120."
6589,7278-104730-0011.flac," when his fellow representatives, almost to a man, deserved him, he was sustained by many a token of sympathy and admiration coming from among the people at large."

6591,7278-104730-0036.flac," in december 1837, still at this same work, he made a hard but fruitless effort."
6592,7278-104730-0040.flac, i waited till it subsets dotted and then resumed that if they could catch him they would hang him. i said this so as to be distinctly heard throughout the hall. the renewed

6597,7278-104730-0027.flac, 1837 would be my irredeemable ruin in this world. and both the ruling political parties are watching with intense anxiety for some over-act by-may to set the whole pack of their harrowing presses upon me.
6598,7278-104730-0029.flac," urging him to action, which would only have destroyed him further in political life. would have stripped him of his influence. exiled him from the position in congress where he could render the most efficient service that was in him."
6599,7278-104730-0016.flac, declaring that the house would not entertain any petitions for the abolition.
6600,7278-104730-0000.flac, were before him. it was a part of his destiny to become the champion of the antoslavary cause and the national legislature.
6601,7278-104730-0015.flac," but in a moment, mr. glasscock of georgia moved that the petition be not received. the base bring up on a point of order and two days later, before the question of reception was determined, a resolution was offered by mr. jarvis of maine."
6602,7278-104730-0009.flac," having a natural distaste for disquieting agitation and influence by class feeling, the gentleman of the north. sympathizing with the aristocracy of the south could not make common cause with anti-slavery people. fortunately,"

6604,7278-104730-0035.flac," no. return to my request from the several side of the house. the next day he presented 51 more like documents and notes, having previously presented 150 more."
6605,7278-104730-0012.flac," quite in the wrong and predestined to well, married to defeat."
6606,7278-104730-0023.flac," he brought up the matter again. one of his opponents made a fall step, and mr. adams bantered him. upon it until he was otherwise provoked into saying that, if the question ever came to the issue of war, the southern people"
6607,7278-104730-0002.flac, that he had always cherished an abhorrence of slavery and a bitter antipathy to slave holders as a class is sufficiently indicated by many chance remarks scattered.
6608,7278-104730-0039.flac," i said that in another part of the capital, it had been threatened that if a northern abolitionist should go to north carolina, another principal of the declaration of independence. here a loud cry of order, order, burst forth in which the speaker yelled the loudest"
6609,7278-104730-0007.flac," overall him, nor loneliness dispeared him. he was probably the most formidable fighter in debate of whom parliamentary records preserved the memory."
6610,7278-246956-0003.flac, of the advantages he took. for he knew that he had known them such as shrunk from the light not coming.

6616,7278-246956-0020.flac," for the time at least, then when oceanslay betwixt their birth and their meeting. and he found himself looking back with vague longing, even to the terrible old house of glaston."
6617,7278-246956-0001.flac," mr. drew's head was down, as i have always said certain things he had been taught in his youth and had practiced in his manhood. certain mean ways counted honest enough in the trade had become to him."

6619,7278-246956-0035.flac," i will tell you all about it in the garden after dinner. aunt has the good sense never to interrupt us there. he added, i'll just run and show myself to leopold. he must not suspect that i am of your party and"
6620,7278-246956-0008.flac," then all the rest. leopold was ever present to him, and while he strove to avoid absorption in a personal interest, however, justifiable, it was of necessity."
6621,7278-246956-0009.flac," of his utterance. at times, indeed, he felt as if he were speaking to him immediately, and to him only, at others, although then he saw her no more than him."
6622,7278-246956-0011.flac," and the firm mouth had forgotten itself into a tremulous form, which the stillness of absorption had there for the moment fixed. but even already, although he could not yet read it upon her,"

6625,7278-246956-0017.flac," she was a free woman, and as leopold had chosen other counselors, had thus declared her unworthy of confidence. and after all that, she had suffered and done for love of him."
6626,7278-246956-0024.flac," that they would but strengthen him in his determination to do whatever the teacher of them might have proved. as she repast him to go to the drawing room, she did indeed say a word of kindness, but it was in a forced tone."
6627,7278-246956-0022.flac," had been filled with wave upon wave of wishing that poldy could hear this, could hear that, could have such a thought to comfort him, such a lovely word to drive the whore from the soul."
6628,7278-246956-0013.flac," when the world was without form and void, and the snake said, why then did he not speak like that to my leopold? why did he not comfort him? with such a good hope."
6629,7278-246956-0005.flac, from them by the indwelling presence of the god of all living man and true merchants was a blessedness unspeakable. small was the suspicion in the abbey church of alliston that morning.
6630,7278-246956-0007.flac," with wheels that might become free as his own. while wingfold had been speaking in general terms with the race in his minds and the congregation in his body's eye, he had yet thought more of one soul with its one crime and its intolerable burden."

6633,7278-246956-0023.flac," now cast on him a chili glance and said never a word of the things to which she had listened with such heavings of the spirit ocean, for she felt with an instinct more righteous than her will."
6634,7278-246956-0018.flac," had she not done enough, would even her father require more of her than she had already done and endured."
6635,7278-246956-0010.flac," that he was comforting the sister individually, and holding out to her brother the mighty hope of a restored purity, and when once more his mind could receive the messages"
6636,7278-246956-0006.flac," battery of sin sprung suffering, with standing and enduring and stealing the recoil of the awful force, wherewith his father had launched the worlds and give birth to human souls."
6637,7278-246956-0012.flac," contnance, a snake had begun to lift its head from the chaotic swamp which runs a creek at least into every soul. the rudimentary disillation, a remnant of the time,"
6638,7278-246956-0000.flac," after the sermon. as the sermon drew to a close and the mist of his emotion began to disperse, individual faces of his audience again dawned out on the preacher's kin."
6639,7278-246956-0004.flac, he was now doing his best to banish them from his business. and yet they were a painful presence to his spirit. so grievous to be born.
6640,7278-246956-0016.flac," a grey, winery mist had settled down upon her spirit, and she said to herself that if this last hope in george should fail her, she would not allow the matter to trouble her any further."
6641,7278-246956-0031.flac," plentiful material for misinterpretation. let a man have truth in the inward parts and out of the abundance of his heart, let his mouth speak. if then he should have ground to fear honest misunderstanding"

6643,7278-246956-0015.flac," he imagined it came from his own spirit and must therefore be obeyed as the will of god. so said the snake, and by the time helen had walked home with her aunt, the glow had sunk from her soul and"
6644,7278-246956-0032.flac," let him preach again to enforce the truth for which he is jealous, and if it should seem to any that the two utterances need reconciling, let those who would have them consistent reconcile them for themselves."

6646,1594-135914-0021.flac," you know the natural goodness of my disposition, and that i love to do justice. by these words,"

6648,1594-135914-0106.flac," and there is no question, but that he will load your family with favors."
6649,1594-135914-0007.flac," but they hoped, because they wished it, their affection for him, increasing instead of diminishing with their misfortunes. their conversation was generally about him, and they inquired for him of all they met. but let us leave, jalib al-kalub and her mother."
6650,1594-135914-0024.flac," i must own that from the first moment he saw me, he perhaps designed to devote himself to me, and conceived hopes of engaging me to admit his love. i guess at this, by the eagerness which he showed in entertaining me,"
6651,1594-135914-0064.flac," and, doubt not, he will do you as much good as he has done you injury. you are no longer his enemies. he waits for ghanam to require the service he has done me by uniting our fortunes. he gives me to him for his consort."
6652,1594-135914-0029.flac," he perceived it, but far from availing himself of my frailty, and notwithstanding the flame which consumed him, he still remained steady in his duty, and all that his passion could force from him, were the words i have already repeated to your majesty."
6653,1594-135914-0075.flac," whose eyes were closed, his countenance pale, disfigured, and bathed in tears. she gazed earnestly on him, her heart beat, and she fancyed she'd be held gone, but yet she would not believe her eyes."
6654,1594-135914-0092.flac," and she satisfied his inquiries, saying so many things in commendation of ganam's mother and sister, he desired to see them as well as the young merchant. though haroon al-rushid was passionate, and in his heat sometimes guilty of cruel actions,"
6655,1594-135914-0077.flac," ghanam said she, with a trembling voice. is it you, i behold? having spoken these words, she stopped to give the young man time to answer, but observing that he seemed insensible. alas, ghanam added she."
6656,1594-135914-0056.flac," said to ghanam's mother, be so kind as to tell us your misfortunes and recount your story, you cannot make the relation to any person's better disposed to use all possible means to comfort you."
6657,1594-135914-0042.flac," the next day she took another purse of the same value, and in like equipage's the day before, went to the square of the jeweler's shops, and stopping at the gateway without alighting, sent one of her black unix for the syndic or chief of them."
6658,1594-135914-0115.flac," the siddiqu, who was a man of a good taste, chose such as were very handsome and had them made up with all expedition. they were finished in three days, and ghanam finding himself strong enough prepared to go abroad."
6659,1594-135914-0019.flac," she prostrated herself before him, and so continued, her face bathed in tears."
6660,1594-135914-0096.flac," who told her that ghanam had rested well that night, and that his disorder proceeding altogether from melancholy, the cause being removed, he would soon recover his health."
6661,1594-135914-0102.flac," he has doubtless listened to you. you have dispelled his jealousy, and he has restored you to his favor."" yes, my dear ghanam answered, fetna. i have cleared myself before the commander of the true believers, who, to make amends for the wrong he has done you,"
6662,1594-135914-0095.flac," go back to that young merchant, and as soon as he has recovered his health, you shall bring him to me with his mother and sister. the next morning, early fetna repaired to the syndic of the jewelers, being impatient to hear of ghanam's health, and tell the mother and daughter the good news she had for them."
6663,1594-135914-0119.flac," which he managed very gracefully. the mother and daughter were mounted on mules belonging to the palace, and whilst fetna, on another mule, led them by a byway to the princess court, jaffir conducted ghanam and brought him into the hall of audience."
6664,1594-135914-0053.flac," madam, answer the syndix wife, they lie in those beds you see by each other."
6665,1594-135914-0084.flac," in favor of whom the commander of the true believers has caused a proclamation to be made in baghdad, declaring that he forgives him what is past, be satisfied for the present, with knowing so much."
6666,1594-135914-0083.flac," but you shall see her again as soon as you are in a condition to bear the interview. you now stand in need of rest and nothing ought to obstruct your taking it. the situation of your affairs is altered since you are, as i suppose, that ghanam."
6667,1594-135914-0118.flac, ganam return no other answer to the vizier's compliment than by profoundly bowing his head.
6668,1594-135914-0017.flac," he was overjoyed at the thought, for he respected vetna, and had been much concerned at her disgrace. therefore, flying instantly to the tower, madame said he to the favorite, with such an air as expressed a satisfaction, be pleased to follow me."
6669,1594-135914-0108.flac," he appeared so impatient to see them that the favorite could no longer defer, giving him the satisfaction, and accordingly called them in. they were at the door waiting for that moment. they entered, went up to ghanam, and embracing him in their turns."
6670,1594-135914-0100.flac," you have again found your fetna, whom you thought you had lost forever."
6671,1594-135914-0088.flac," fatna then said, let us bless heaven for having brought us all together."
6672,1594-135914-0103.flac, beautiful fetna. may i give credit to what you tell me?
6673,1594-135914-0105.flac," who before caused search to be made for you to take away your life, and who in his fury caused your mother and your sister to suffer a thousand indignities, desires now to see you, that he may reward the respect you had for him."
6674,1594-135914-0087.flac," there was no occasion for the syndic saying any more to ghanam's mother. as soon as she was told that she could not converse with her son without hazarding his life, she ceased insisting to go and see him."
6675,1594-135914-0116.flac," while he was making ready with his mother and sister, the grand vizier, jaffiiler came to the sindex house. he had come on horseback, attended by a great number of officers. sir,"" said hita ganam, as soon as he entered."
6676,1594-135914-0070.flac," he was bound with cords on a camel, because he had not strengthened enough to sit. they had already unbound him, and were carrying him into the hospital when i happened to pass by. i went up to the young man, viewed him attentively."
6677,1594-135914-0046.flac, and will be pleased to step to my house.
6678,1594-135914-0047.flac," i met them yesterday as they were coming into the city. they were in a deplorable condition, and it moved me the more because i thought they were persons of rank. through all the rags that covered them, notwithstanding the impression the sun has made on their faces,"
6679,1594-135914-0110.flac," when they had dried up their tears, ganam drew them afresh by the recital of what he had suffered from the day he left fetna, till the moment the sindic brought him to his house. he told them that having taken refuge in a small village, he there fell sick."
6680,1594-135914-0098.flac," because there was ground to fear that not knowing his mother and sister were at baghdad, the sight of them might occasion too great a surprise and joy. it was therefore resolved that fetna should first go alone into ghanam's chamber."
6681,1594-135914-0123.flac," and assigned him a considerable pension. he then descended from his throne, and causing only ghanam and the grand vizier follow him, retired into his own apartment."
6682,1594-135914-0020.flac, i think you charge me with violence and injustice. who is he that notwithstanding the regard and respect he had for me is in a miserable condition? speak freely.
6683,1594-135914-0076.flac," though she found something of ghanam in the objects she beheld, yet, in other respects, he appeared so different that she dursed not imagine it was he that lay before her. unable, however, to withstand the earnest desire of being satisfied."
6684,1594-135914-0068.flac," but why should we despair of seeing him again? we shall find him. the happiness of meeting with you makes me conceive fresh hopes. perhaps this is the last day of your sufferings, and the beginning of a greater felicity than you enjoyed in damascus."
6685,1594-135914-0040.flac, she then withdrew into the apartment she had occupied before her melancholy adventure.
6686,1594-135914-0049.flac," because we wish to let them take some rest before we trouble them with our questions. fetna, without knowing why, felt a curiosity to see them. the syndic would have conducted her to his house,"
6687,1594-135914-0043.flac," the sindic, who was a most charitable man and spent above two-thirds of his income in relieving poor strangers, sick or in distress, did not make fetna wait, knowing by her dress that she was a lady belonging to the palace. i apply myself to you,"" said she."
6688,1594-135914-0062.flac," no doubt of it,"" said fetna, interrupting her there, he is no more guilty than you are. i can assure you of his innocence. for i am that very fetna you so much complain of, who through some fatality in my stars"
6689,1594-135914-0022.flac," commander of the true believers said she, if i have let fall any word that is not agreeable to your majesty, i most humbly beseech you to forgive me. but he, whose innocence and wretched state you desire to be informed of,"
6690,1594-135914-0085.flac," the lady, who just now spoke to you, will acquaint you with the rest. therefore think of nothing but recovering your health. i will contribute all in my power towards it."" having spoke these words, he left god him to take his rest."
6691,1594-135914-0127.flac," i give you to jaffir, and you, fetna, to ganam. let a cosy and witnesses be called, and the three contracts be drawn up and signed immediately."
6692,1594-135914-0099.flac," when she thought it was proper. matters being so ordered, the cindic announced fetness coming to the sick man, who was so transported to see her that he was again near fainting away. well-gannum said she, drawing near to his bed."
6693,1594-135914-0091.flac," commander of the true believers said she, i have been so successful that i have found him, and also his mother and sister."
6694,1594-135914-0015.flac," will not prevent you're being condemned and punished for your violent and unjust proceedings. here fetness ceased her complaints, her size and tears putting a stop to her utterance."
6695,1594-135914-0114.flac," but i will go and make some provision for them. this said, she went to the palace, and soon returned with a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold, which she delivered to the sindic, desiring him to buy a peril for the mother and daughter."
6696,1594-135914-0117.flac," i am come from the commander of the true believers, my master and yours. the orders i have differ much from those which i do not wish to revive in your memory. i am to bear you company."
6697,1594-135914-0086.flac, exhausted by a hard living and toil.
6698,1594-135914-0059.flac," i had a son called ghanam, who coming to trade a baghdad has been accused of carrying off fetna."
6699,1594-135914-0033.flac," i believe all you have told me. but why was it so long before you let me hear from you? was there any need of staying a whole month after my return before you sent me word where you were? commander of the true believers, answered fetna."
6700,1594-135914-0026.flac," i owe this justice to his virtue to declare his behavior was always suitable to his words. you, commander of the true believers, well know with what rigor you have treated him, and you will answer for it before the tribunal of god."""
6701,1594-135914-0101.flac, what miracle has restored you to my sight?
6702,1594-135914-0069.flac," when ganam was with you. fetna would have proceeded, but the syndic of the jewelers coming in interrupted her. madame said he to her, i come from seeing a very moving object. it is a young man whom a camel driver had just carried to a hospital."
6703,1594-135914-0048.flac, while she herself led them to our warm bath and gave them clean linen.
6704,1594-135914-0009.flac, the uncertainty of whose fate was a killing affliction. there was scarcely a moment in which she did not lament him.
6705,1594-135914-0023.flac," is ganam, the unhappy son of abua yub, late a rich merchant of damascus. he saved my life from a grave and afforded me a sanctuary in his house."
6706,1594-135914-0089.flac," and tomorrow morning i will return to you. this said, she embraced the mother and the daughter and went away. as soon as she came to the palace,"
6707,1594-135914-0011.flac," stopped, and drawing near the door to listen, distinctly heard these words which fetna, whose thoughts were always anganam, uttered with a loud voice. o ganam, two unfortunate ganam, where are you at this time?"
6708,1594-135914-0016.flac," he plainly perceived that if what he had heard was true, his favorite must be innocent, and that he had been too hasty in giving such orders against ghanaman and his family."
6709,1594-135914-0054.flac," good woman,"" said she, ""'i come to offer you my assistance. i have considerable interest in this city, and may be of service to you and your companion.' madam, answer ghanam's mother,"
6710,1594-135914-0052.flac," fetna raised her up and said, my good lady."
6711,1594-135914-0067.flac, the wealth ghanam had in this city is not lost. it is in my apartment in the palace. but i know all the treasure in the world cannot comfort you without ghanam if i may judge a view by myself. blood is no less powerful than loving great minds.
6712,1594-135914-0104.flac," nothing is more certain, answered the lady."
6713,1594-135914-0073.flac," i have caused him to be brought to my own house, by my slaves, and they are now in a private room where i placed him, putting on some of my own linen, and treating him as they would do myself. fetness heart beat at these words of the jeweler."
6714,1594-135914-0126.flac," who shall become the first cause of your good fortune, as she was of your past sufferings. this is not all,"" added he, turning toward ganam's mother. ""'you are still young. i believe you will not disdain to be a lie to my grand-vizier.'"
6715,1594-135914-0032.flac, when she had done speaking.
6716,1594-135914-0000.flac," in this miserable state, they came to the first village. the peasants' wives flocked about them, and, as it appeared through their disguise, that they were people of some condition, asked them what was the occasion of their traveling in a habit that did not seem to belong to them."
6717,1594-135914-0055.flac, that fetna and the cindex wife could not for bear letting fall some tears.
6718,1594-135914-0063.flac," have occasioned you so many misfortunes. to me you must impute the loss of your son if he is no more. but if i have occasioned your misfortun, i can in some measure relieve it."
6719,1594-135914-0128.flac, but he was resolved to marry her. harun thought this such an extraordinary story that he ordered his story agrafer to commit it to writing with all its circumstances.
6720,1594-135914-0071.flac," and fancied his countenance was not altogether unknown to me. i asked him some questions concerning his family and his country, but all the answers i could get were size and tears. i took pity on him."
6721,1594-135914-0031.flac," and enlarging on the application she owed to ganem. but above all, she highly extolled his discretion."
6722,1594-135914-0122.flac," after which he said to him, ""'gonim, i will have you live in my court.' commander of the true believers answered the young merchant, a slave has no will but his masters on whom his life and fortune depend."
6723,1594-135914-0078.flac, it is not you that i address. my imagination being overcharged with your image has given to a stranger a deceitful resemblance.
6724,1594-135914-0038.flac," i must do more,"" rejoined the prince, in requital for having saved your life, and the respect he has strewn for me to make amends for the loss of his fortune. in short, to repair the wrong i have done to himself and his family, i have done to"
6725,1594-135914-0050.flac," for they were the persons the syndic had been speaking of to fetna. the syndic's wife being informed by the slave that a lady from the palace was in her house was hastening to meet her. but fetna, who had followed the slave, did not give her time."
6726,1594-135914-0039.flac, i give him to you for a husband.
6727,1594-135914-0109.flac," the cindic himself and his wife were so moved at the spectacle that they could not forbear weeping, nor sufficiently admire the secret workings of providence, which had brought together into their house four persons whom fortune had so cruelly persecuted."
6728,1594-135914-0124.flac," not questioning, but that fetna was in waiting, with a bua yub's widow and daughter, he caused them to be called in. they prostrated themselves before him. he made them rise, and was so chombed by jalli about kallub's beauty."
6729,1594-135914-0014.flac," how can you excopate yourself when you shall appear with ganon before the tribunal of the supreme judge and the angel shall testify the truth before your face? all the power you are now invested with and which makes almost the whole world tremble,"
6730,1594-135914-0113.flac," as soon as ganem has recovered his health,"
6731,1594-135914-0058.flac," but suppressing her agitation and concern, she suffered ghanam's mother to proceed in the following manner."
6732,1594-135914-0036.flac," i acknowledge my fault and would willingly make amends for it, by heaping favors on the young merchant of damascus. consider therefore what i can do for him. ask what you think fit, and i will grant it."""
6733,1594-135914-0120.flac," arabs, persians, egyptians, africans, and syrians of his own domains not to mention strangers. when the vizier had conducted gondom to the foot of the throne,"
6734,1594-135914-0012.flac," wither has thy cruel fate led thee. alas, it is i that have made you wretched. why did you not let me perish miserably rather than afford me your generous relief? what melancholy return have you received for your care and respect?"
6735,1594-135914-0001.flac," instead of answering the question, they fell to weeping, which only served to heighten the curiosity of the peasants, and to move their compassion. ghanam's mother told them what she and her daughter had endured, at which the good country women were sensibly afflicted."
6736,1594-135914-0094.flac," that your search has proved so successful. it is a real satisfaction to me, not so much for your sake as for my own. i will keep the promise i have made you. you shall marry ghanam, and i hear declare you are no longer my slave. you are free."
6737,1594-135914-0080.flac," ah, madam, said he, by what miracle? he could say no more, such a sudden transport of joy seized him that he fainted away. fetna and the sintic did all they could to bring him to himself."
6738,1594-135914-0027.flac," i must make a confession, which perhaps may displease you, but i beg pardon of your majesty beforehand."" speak, daughter, said harun aldrochid. i forgive you all. provided you can seal nothing from me. well then, replied fetna."
6739,1594-135914-0034.flac," ganam went abroad so very seldom that you need not wonder we were not the first that heard of your return. besides, ganam, who took upon him to deliver the letter i wrote to nuran nihar,"
6740,1594-135914-0045.flac," i am also sad aside that you prevent their wants, and that nothing is more grateful to you than to have an opportunity of relieving their misery. madam answered the syndic, i shall obey your commands with pleasure, but if you desire to exercise your charity in person,"
6741,1594-135914-0013.flac," the commander of the faithful, who ought to have rewarded, persecutes you, and in requital for having always regarded me as a person reserved for his bed, you lose your fortune, and are obliged to seek for safety and flight."
6742,1594-135914-0006.flac," thence, notwithstanding all they had endured, they proceeded to baghdad. that was the place they had fixed their thoughts upon."
6743,1594-135914-0030.flac, that which belongs to the master is forbidden to the slave. this ingenuous confession
6744,1594-135914-0044.flac," putting the person to his hands, as a person whose piety is celebrated throughout the city. i desire you to distribute that gold among the poor strangers you relieve, for i know you make it your business to assist those who apply to your charity."
6745,3607-135982-0050.flac," he knew that he would regret in the morning, but at present he was glad of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly. he leaned his elbows on the table, and rested his head between his hands, counting the beats of his temples."
6746,3607-135982-0030.flac," they talked voluably and with little reserve. jimmy, whose imagination was kindling, conceived the lively youth of the frenchman twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the englishman's manner. at graceful image of this, he thought, and adjust one."
6747,3607-135982-0046.flac," jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience. the wit was flashing. play ran very high and paper began to pass. jimmy did not know exactly who was winning, but he knew that he was losing. but it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards."
6748,3607-135982-0010.flac," and had afterwards sent him to dublin university to study law. jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a while. he had money, and he was popular, and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles."
6749,3607-135982-0019.flac," but jimmy, who in spite of temporary errors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts, knew well with what difficulty it had been got together. this knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness."
6750,3607-135982-0047.flac," they were devils of fellows, but he wished they would stop. it was getting late. someone gave the toast of the yacht, the bell of newport, and then someone proposed one great game for a finish. the piano had stopped. velona must have gone up on deck."
6751,3607-135982-0026.flac," in a haze of summer evening. in jimmy's house, this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. a certain pride mingled with his parents' trepidation, a certain eagerness also to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue."
6752,3607-135982-0043.flac," a man brought in a light supper and the young men sat down to it for forms sake. they drank, however, it was bohemian. they drank ireland, england, france, hungary, the united states of america. jimmy made a speech, a long speech."
6753,3607-135982-0032.flac," varevier, not holy ingeniously, undertook to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french mechanicians. the resident voice of the hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters."
6754,3607-135982-0000.flac," the cars came scutting in towards dublin, running evenly like pellets in the groove of the nass road."
6755,3607-135982-0045.flac," the table was cleared. vellona returned quietly to his piano and played volunteers for them. the other men played game after game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. they drank the health of the queen of hearts and of the queen of diamonds."
6756,3607-135982-0036.flac," at the corner of grafton street, a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party. andre, it's farley!"
6757,3607-135982-0027.flac," and as he stood in the hall, giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie, his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchasable. his father, therefore, was unusually friendly with valona."
6758,3607-135982-0021.flac," jimmy had a respect for his father's shrewdness in business matters, and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment, money to be made in the motor business, pots of money. moreover, segwa had the unmistakable heir of wealth."
6759,3607-135982-0018.flac," it was pleasant after that honor to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks. then as to money, he really had a great sum under his control."
6760,3607-135982-0017.flac," at the control, saguayah had presented him to one of the french competitors, and in answer to his confused murmur of complement, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth."
6761,3607-135982-0002.flac," the cars of their friends, the french. the french, moreover, were virtual victors. their team had finished solidly. they had been placed second and third, and the driver of the winning german car was reported a belgian."
6762,3607-135982-0014.flac," decidedly, valona was in excellent spirits. he kept up a deep, bass hum of melody for miles of the road. the frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders, and often jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase."
6763,3607-135982-0001.flac," careering homeward, and through this channel of poverty and inaction, the continent sped its wealth and industry. now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the great filial pressed. their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars."
6764,3607-135982-0011.flac," his father, remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had paid his bills and brought him home."
6765,3607-135982-0009.flac," he had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts, and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the dublin newspapers as a merchant prince. he had sent his son to england to be educated in a big catholic college."
6766,3607-135982-0034.flac," the room grew doubly hot, and següën's task grew harder each moment. there was even danger of personal spite. the alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to humanity, and when the toast had been drunk, he threw up in a window significantly."
6767,3607-135982-0041.flac," vlona said with conviction, it is delightful. there was a yacht piano on the cabin. vlona played a waltz for farley and riviera. farley acting as cavalier and riviera's lady."
6768,3607-135982-0025.flac," where to go home to dress. the car steered out slowly for grafton street while the two young men pushed their way through the gaysers. they walked northward with the curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise. while the city hung its pale globes of light above them,"
6769,3607-135982-0013.flac," velona was entertaining also, a brilliant pianist, but unfortunately very poor. the car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. the two cousins sat on the front seat, jimmy and his hungarian friend set behind."
6770,3607-135982-0023.flac," and, gallantly, the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal. they drove down dame street. the street was busy with unusual traffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram drivers."
6771,3607-135982-0044.flac," vellona saying, here, here, whenever there was a pause. there was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. it must have been a good speech. farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. what jovial fellows, what good company they were. cards, cards!"
6772,3607-135982-0012.flac," who had seen so much of the world, and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in france. such a person, as his father agreed, was well worth knowing, even if he had not been the charming companion he was."
6773,3607-135982-0039.flac," they were walking out of king's town station. the ticket collector saluted jimmy. he was an old man. fine night, sora. it was a serene summer night, the harbor lay like a darkened mirror at their feet."
6774,3607-135982-0042.flac," then in impromptu squared ants the men devising original figures. what mariment! jimmy took his part with a will. this was seeing life at least. then farley got out of breath and cried, stop!"
6775,3607-135982-0048.flac," it was a terrible game. they stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck. jimmy understood that the game lay between ralph and siguin. what excitement! jimmy was excited too. he would lose, of course. i'm much had he written away."
6776,3607-135982-0004.flac," in fact, these four young men were almost hilarious. they were charles següa, the owner of the car. andré rivière, a young electrician of canadian birth. a huge hungarian named vilona."
6777,3607-135982-0031.flac," he admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation. the five young men had various tastes, and their tongues had been loosened. vilona, with immense respect, began to discover to the mildly surprised englishmen the beauties of the english madrigal."
6778,3607-135982-0037.flac," a torrent of talk followed. farley was an american. no one knew very well what the talk was about. faloana and noreviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. they got up on a car, squeezing themselves together, amid much laughter."
6779,3607-135982-0024.flac," near the bank, siguan drew up, and jimin is friend-delighted. a little not of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor. the party was to dine together that evening in siguan's hotel, and meanwhile, jimin is friend who was staying with him."
6780,3607-135982-0020.flac," and if he had been so conscious of the labor latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance? it was a serious thing for him."
6781,3607-135982-0028.flac," in his manner, expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments, but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the hungarian, who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner. the dinner was excellent, exquisite."
6782,3607-135982-0022.flac, jimmy set out to translate into today's work that lordly carr in which he sat. how smoothly it ran. in what style they had come careering along the country roads. the journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life.
6783,3607-135982-0040.flac," they proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing cadet russell in a chorus, stamping their feet at every, ho ho ho hey vremo! they got into a robot at the slip and made out for the americans yacht. there was to be supper, music, cards."
6784,3607-135982-0007.flac, besides he was an optimist by nature. the fourth member of the party however was too excited to be genuinely happy. he was about 26 years of age with a soft light brown mustache and rather innocent looking grey eyes.
6785,3607-135982-0008.flac," his father, who had begun life as an advanced nationalist, had modified his views early. he had made his money as a butcher in king's town, and by opening shops in dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over."
6786,3607-135982-0051.flac, the cabin door opened and he saw the hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light.
6787,3607-135982-0035.flac, that night the city wore the mask of a capital. the five young men strolled along steven's green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. they talked loudly and galley and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. the people made way for them.
6788,3607-135982-0038.flac, to a music of mary bells.
6789,3607-135982-0049.flac," the men rose to their feet to play the last tricks, talking and gesticulating. ralph won. the cabins shook with the young men's cheering, and the cards were bundled together. they began then to gather in what they had won. farley and jimmy were the heaviest losers."
6790,3607-135982-0033.flac," when segua shepherded his party into politics. here was congenial ground for all. jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father awake to life within him. he aroused the torpit routh at last."
6791,3607-135982-0015.flac," this was not altogether pleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning, and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind. besides vlona's humming would confuse anybody the noise of the car, too."
6792,3607-135982-0016.flac," rapid motion through space elates one, so does notoriety, so does the possession of money. these were three good reasons for jimmy's excitement. he had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these continentals."
6793,3607-135982-0005.flac, and a neatly groomed young man named doyle. segguin was in a good humor because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance. he was about to start a motor establishment in paris.
6794,3607-135982-0006.flac, riviere was in good humor because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment. these two young men who were cousins were also in good humor because of the success of the french cars. the loaner was in good humor because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon.
6795,3607-135982-0029.flac," siguan, jimmy decided, had a very refined taste. the party was increased by a young englishman named ralph, whom jimmy had seen with siguan at cambridge. the young men sucked in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps."
6796,3607-135982-0003.flac," each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill, and each chair of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car. in one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present."
6797,3607-29116-0045.flac," haven't protect me from such a charge. that is what dilwurthy said. and yet when you come to look at it, you cannot deny that we would have to go without the services of some of our ableist men, sir. if the country were opposed to to bribery, it is a harsh term. i do not like to use it."
6798,3607-29116-0026.flac, uncle dilworthy. uncle balloon tells very amusing stories when ladies are not present. i should think so. mmm. mmm. 85. there. i must find that chairman. queer. bucks don't x.
6799,3607-29116-0032.flac," and then hicks went on with a serious error. colonel, if you register a letter, it means that it is a value, doesn't it? and if you pay 15 cents for registering it, the government will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it is lost. isn't that so?"
6800,3607-29116-0031.flac," and perhaps that didn't lessen the relish of the conversation to the correspondence. it seems that they had got hold of the drywoods box packing story about balloon one day, and we're talking it over when the colonel came in. the colonel wanted to know all about it, and hicks told him."
6801,3607-29116-0021.flac," i suppose he will paint pub docks on them and frank them home. that's good economy, isn't it? yes, yes, but child all congressmen do that. it may not be strictly honest. indeed, it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in with the clothes."
6802,3607-29116-0041.flac," we have many truly noble statesmen in our country service like balloon. the senate is full of them. don't you think so, colonel? well, i don't know. i honor my country's public servants as much as anyone can. i meet them, sir, every day, and the more i see of them,"
6803,3607-29116-0023.flac," erasing, figuring, and talking to herself. free. i wonder what dilworthy does think of me anyway. 1, 2, 8, 17,"
6804,3607-29116-0029.flac, and more than she thought proper to tell him. she was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young fellows of newspaper row and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual advantage.
6805,3607-29116-0024.flac, wouldn't delward the open his eyes if he knew some of the things balloon did say to me there hoppersons influence out to count 20 the sanctimonious old carmudge in sun and law cinecure in the negro institution that about gauges him the three committee men
6806,3607-29116-0034.flac," it was an ingenious thing, and it had a genuine touch of humor about it, too. i think there's more real talent among our public men of today than there was among those of old times. a far more fertile fancy, a much happier ingenuity."
6807,3607-29116-0020.flac," but he is right at heart, his term expires next year, and i fear we shall lose him."" he seemed to be packing the day i was there. his rooms were full of dry goods, boxes, into which his servant was crowding all manner of old clothes and stuff."
6808,3607-29116-0033.flac," yes, i suppose it so. well, senator balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those seven huge boxes of old clothes, and ship that ton of second-hand rubbish, old boots and pantaloons, and what not through the males, as registered matter."
6809,3607-29116-0028.flac," but as he lodged near the bookstore, she would drop in there and keep a lookout for him. while laura is on her errand to find mr. bucksdown, it may not be out of the way to remark that she knew quite as much of washington life as senator dilworthy gave her credit for."
6810,3607-29116-0025.flac," suns and law. nothing like a sun and law here in washington or a brother-in-law. and everybody has them. let's see. 61 with places. 25. persuaded. it is getting on. we'll have two-thirds of congress in time. still, we're the must-surely no, i understand him."
6811,3607-29116-0036.flac," i have a much greater admiration for senator balloon. yes, balloon is a man of parts, there's no denying it. i think so. he is spoken of for the post of minister to china, or austria, and i hope will be appointed."
6812,3607-29116-0027.flac," seemed to be in love, i was sure of it. he promised to come here, and he hasn't. strange. very strange. i must chance to meet him today."" laura dressed and went out, thinking she was perhaps too early for mr. buckstone to come from the house."
6813,3607-29116-0035.flac," now, colonel, can you picture jefferson or washington or john adams franking their wardrobes through the males and adding the facetious idea of making the government responsible for the cargo for the sum of $1.5 statesman were dull creatures in those days."
6814,3607-29116-0022.flac," it's a funny world. goodbye, uncle. i'm going to see that chairman. and humming a cherry opera air, she departed to her room to dress for going out. before she did that, however, she took out her notebook and was soon deep in its contents, marking, dashing,"
6815,3607-29116-0042.flac," of securing their services. few lands are so blessed. that is true, colonel. to be sure you can buy now and then a senator or a representative, but they do not know it is wrong, and so they are not ashamed of it. they are gentle and confiding in childlike."
6816,3607-29116-0040.flac," that is to say he charged nothing more than the lumber would bring. but the poor engines, not that i care much for engines, what did he do for them? gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with. governor balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor indians, but balloon is not alone."
6817,3607-29116-0043.flac," and in my opinion, these are qualities that enable them far more than any amount of"
6818,3607-29116-0030.flac," they were always talking in the row, ever-lastingly gossiping, bantering, and sarcastically praising things, and going on in a style which was a curious commingling of earnest and purseflage. colonel sellers liked this talk amazingly, though he was sometimes a little at sea in it."
6819,3607-29116-0039.flac, who's landed been taken from them by the white man in the interests of civilization. but balloon knew their needs better. he built a government sawmill on the reservation with the money and the lumber sold for enormous prices. a relative of his did all the work free of charge.
6820,3607-29116-0044.flac," i quite agree with you, colonel sellers. well, has it dated the colonel? i am afraid some of them do by their seats. yes, i am afraid they do, but as senator dilworthy himself said to me, it is sinful. it is very wrong. it is shameful."
6821,3607-29116-0037.flac," what we want to brought as good examples of the national character. john j. and benjamin franklin were well enough in their day, but the nation has made progress since then. balloon is a man we know and can depend on to be true to himself."
6822,3607-29116-0038.flac," yes, and balloon has had a good deal of public experience. he is an old friend of mine. he was governor of one of the territories a while and was very satisfactory. indeed, he was. he was ex-efficio an indian agent, too."
6823,3607-29116-0010.flac," if it was not to aid in the salvation of his fellow men. the senator spoke with feeling, and then added, i hope you showed hopperson that our motives were pure. yes, and he seemed to have a new light on the measure, i think, will vote for it."
6824,3607-29116-0002.flac," and the senator beamed with his own congressional wit. in the committee of the whole, things are working very well. we have made ever so much progress in a week. i believe that you and i together could run this government beautifully, uncle. the senator beamed again."
6825,3607-29116-0011.flac," i hope so. his name will give tone and strength to it. i knew you would only have to show him that it was just and pure, in order to secure his cordial support. i think i convinced him. yes. i'm perfectly sure he will vote right now."
6826,3607-29116-0008.flac," and for the good of the colored race. much as i am interested in the heirs of this property, and would like to have them succeed. laura looked a little incredulous, and the senator proceeded. don't misunderstand me. i don't deny that it is for the interest of all of us that this bill should go through, and it will."
6827,3607-29116-0004.flac," i don't know any man in congress, i'd sooner go to for help in any christian work. what did he say? oh, he beat around a little. he said he should help the negro. his heart went out to the negro and all that. plenty of them say that, but he was a little afraid of the tennessee land bill."
6828,3607-29116-0013.flac, running his eye down the list. that's encouraging. what is the c before some of the names? and the bb? those are my private marks. that c stands for convinced with argument.
6829,3607-29116-0003.flac," he liked to be called uncle by this beautiful woman. did you see hopperson last night after the congressional prayer meeting? yes, he came. he's a kind of... eh? he is one of my friends, laura. he's a fine man. a very fine man."
6830,3607-29116-0015.flac," but he has charitable impulses. if we secure him, we shall have a favorable report by the committee."
6831,3607-29116-0006.flac, i have been with him a great deal on conference committees. he wants reasons. good ones. didn't you show him he was an error about the bill? i did. i went over the whole thing. i had to tell him some of the side arrangements. some of the—you didn't mention me.
6832,3607-29116-0016.flac," oh, i saw senator balloon. he will help us, i suppose. balloon is a wholehearted fellow. i can't help loving that man for all his drullery and waggishness. he puts on an heir of levity sometimes, but the rena man in the senate knows the scriptures as he does."
6833,3607-29116-0009.flac," i have no concealments from you, but i have one principle in my public life, which i should like you to keep in mind. it has always been my guide. i never push a private interest if it is not justified and enabled by some larger public good."
6834,3607-29116-0019.flac," my daughter said the senator with a grave look. i trust there was nothing free in his manner. free repeated lara with indignation in her face. with me. there there child, i meant nothing. balloon talks a little freely sometimes with men."
6835,3607-29116-0014.flac," i expect to see the chairman of the committee today, mr. bucksdon."
6836,3607-29116-0012.flac," that's good. that's good, said the senator, smiling and rubbing his hands. is there anything more? you'll find some changes in that, i guess, handing the senator a printed list of names. those checked off are all right. ah!"
6837,3607-29116-0000.flac," laura went downstairs, knocked at the study door and entered, scarcely waiting for the response. senator dilworthy was alone, with an open bible in his hand, upside down. laura smiled and said, forgetting her acquired correctness of speech, it is only me."
6838,3607-29116-0017.flac," he did not make any objections? not exactly. he said, shall i tell you what he said? ask laura glancing furtively at him? certainly. he said he had no doubt it was a good thing. if senator dilworthy was in it, it would pay to look into it."
6839,3607-29116-0007.flac," oh no, i told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy part of it as you are. daft is a little strong, laura, but you know that i wouldn't touch this bill."
6840,3607-29116-0005.flac," if senator dilworthy wasn't in it, he should suspect there was a fraud on the government. he said that, did he? yes, and he said he felt he couldn't vote for it. he was shy. not shy, child. cautious. he's a very cautious man."
6841,3607-29116-0001.flac," ah, come in, sit down, and the senator closed the book and laid it down. i wanted to see you."
6842,3607-29116-0018.flac," the senator laughed, but rather feebly, and said, balloon is always full of his jokes. i explained it to him. he said it was all right. he only wanted a word with you, continued lara. he is a handsome old gentleman, and he is gallant for an old man."
6843,412-126975-0021.flac," he took no notice of the girl's alarmed aduration, but left like a grasshopper to the ground beside her, where he might very well have broken his legs. i think i was meant to be a burglar."
6844,412-126975-0005.flac," if i make myself clear, in the green lawns and gray towers of some cathedral town. similarly, in france, when i had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant,"
6845,412-126975-0087.flac," like all true christian benefactors, anonymous. the harlequin, already clad in silver paper out of cigar boxes, was with difficulty"
6846,412-126975-0082.flac," you see an english interior, open, a moonlit garden. it all goes by magic. and snatching a chance piece of billiard chalk from his pocket, he ran it across the hall floor."
6847,412-126975-0049.flac," i won't have you talking like that, cried the girl, who was in a curious glow. you've only talked like that since you became a horrid whats his name. you know what i mean?"
6848,412-126975-0028.flac," oh, that's my godfather, sir leopold fisher. he always comes on boxing day. then after an innocent pause, which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm,"
6849,412-126975-0027.flac," and stood throbbing. ""'hello, hello,' said the young man with the red tie. here's somebody born on the right side anyhow. i didn't know, miss adams, that your santa claus was so modern as this."""
6850,412-126975-0029.flac," ruby adams added. he is very kind. john crook, journalist, had heard of that eminent city magnate, and it was not his fault if the city magnate."
6851,412-126975-0019.flac," was a tall, angular young man, with dark hair sticking up like a hairbrush, intelligent and even distinguished linaments, but a salo and almost alien complexion."
6852,412-126975-0018.flac," oh, don't jump, mr. crook. she called out in some alarm. it's much too high. the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse."
6853,412-126975-0023.flac," how can you say such things?"" she demonstrated. well, said the young man. if you're born on the wrong side of the wall, i can't see that it's wrong to climb over it."
6854,412-126975-0001.flac," was also by a singular coincidence my last. it was committed at christmas. as an artist,"
6855,412-126975-0086.flac," that strangely resembled the large lampshade in the drawing room. the clown and pantaloon made themselves white with flour from the cook, and red with rouge from some other domestic, who remained."
6856,412-126975-0043.flac," with an unaffected vein glory that had something disarming about it, he held out the case before them all. it flew open at a touch and half blinded them."
6857,412-126975-0004.flac," among the lights and screens of the cafe-reach. thus, in england, if i wished to relieve a deen of his riches, which is not so easy as you might suppose, i wished to frame him,"
6858,412-126975-0092.flac," why is he so wild?"" he is harlequin to your columbine,"" said crook. i am only the clown who makes the old jokes. i wish you were the harlequin."
6859,412-126975-0022.flac," he said placidly. and i have no doubt i should have been, if i hadn't happened to be born in that nice house next door. i can't see any harm in it anyhow."
6860,412-126975-0083.flac, halfway between the front door and the staircase to mark the line of the footlights. how even such a banquet of bosch was got ready in the time remained a riddle.
6861,412-126975-0032.flac," and began to unpack him, like some very carefully protected parcel. rugs enough to stock up a czar, furs of all the beasts of the forest, and scarves of all the colors of the rainbow,"
6862,412-126975-0091.flac," to the coattails of sir leopold fisher. this, however, was frowned down. uncle is too absurd, cried ruby to crook, round whose shoulders she had seriously placed the string of sausages."
6863,412-126975-0010.flac," i repented the same evening. flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside, and even from the inside it was odd. seen from the outside,"
6864,412-126975-0066.flac," led fisher to say, in his most sarcastic, magisterial manner. no doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat. what is it, prey?"
6865,412-126975-0052.flac, does a socialist mean a man who desires a social evening with the chimney sweep? a socialist means a man who wants all the chimney swept and all the chimney sweeps paid for it. but who won't allow you?
6866,412-126975-0014.flac," the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening, and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds, filling them, as it were, with the ghosts of the dead roses."
6867,412-126975-0038.flac," everything seemed undistinguished about the priest, even down to his name, which was brown. yet the colonel had always found something comparable about him, and frequently asked him to such family gatherings."
6868,412-126975-0020.flac," this showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie, the only part of his costume of what he seemed to take any care. perhaps it was a symbol."
6869,412-126975-0041.flac," over which hung the kernels soared, the process was completed and the company, including the saturnian crook, presented to sir leopold fisher. that venerable finance here, however,"
6870,412-126975-0045.flac," fisher stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl. the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the colonel, the wonder of the whole group."
6871,412-126975-0057.flac," now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset. the scene thus framed was so colored in quaint, like a backscene in a play, that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the door."
6872,412-126975-0090.flac," he put a paper donkey's head unexpectedly on father brown, who bore it patiently, and even found some private manner of moving his ears. he even assayed to put the paper donkey's tail."
6873,412-126975-0089.flac," she had worn at a fancy dress party as the queen of diamonds. indeed, her uncle, james blount, was getting almost out of hand in his excitement. he was like a schoolboy."
6874,412-126975-0062.flac," of course, of course, replied the colonel carelessly. my dear chap, any friend of yours. no doubt he will prove an acquisition."
6875,412-126975-0071.flac," or something. blue beards more in my line, and him i like best when he turned into the pantaloon. i'm all for making a policeman into sausages,"" said john crook."
6876,412-126975-0037.flac," with him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighboring roman church. for the colonel's late wife had been a catholic, and the children, as is common in such cases, had been trained to follow her."
6877,412-126975-0093.flac," she said, and left the string of sausages swinging. father brown, though he knew every detailed done behind the scenes, and had even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime baby,"
6878,412-126975-0044.flac," it was just as if a crystal fountain had spurred in their eyes. in a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs, three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all around them."
6879,412-126975-0084.flac," but they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry that lives when youth is in a house. and youth was in that house that night, though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from which it flamed."
6880,412-126975-0042.flac," still seemed struggling with portions of his well-lined attire, and at length produced from a very interior tale-coat pocket, a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his christmas present for his goddaughter."
6881,412-126975-0054.flac," with speculation in his eye. i've heard that gardeners use it. and i once made six children happy at christmas when the conjurer didn't come, entirely with soot, applied externally."
6882,412-126975-0000.flac," the flying stars. the most beautiful crime i ever committed, flambeau would say, in his highly moral old age."
6883,412-126975-0007.flac," well, my last crime was a christmas crime. a cheery, cozy, english middle-class crime. a crime of charles dickens."
6884,412-126975-0006.flac," which is almost impossible. it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a gray line of clipped poplars, and though solemn planes of gall over which broods the mighty spirit of melee."
6885,412-126975-0033.flac," were unwrapped one by one, till they revealed something resembling the human form. the form of a friendly, but foreign-looking old gentleman, with a grey goat-like beard and a beaming smile."
6886,412-126975-0039.flac," in the large entrance hall of the house, there was ample room even for sir leopold and the removal of his wraps. ports and vestibule, indeed,"
6887,412-126975-0059.flac," mr. blount started and stopped in his shout of ascent. ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it. his face clouded a little and then cleared, and he turned to his brother-in-law in host."
6888,412-126975-0015.flac," on one side of the house stood the stable. on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind. the young lady, having scattered bread for the birds,"
6889,412-126975-0079.flac," you ought to have a statue, cried the canadian, as he came back radiant from the telephone. there, we are all fitted. mr. crook shall be clowned."
6890,412-126975-0056.flac," and the astonished financier his in some considerable deprecation. when a knock sounded at the double front doors, the priest opened them and they showed again the front garden of evergreens, monkey tree and all."
6891,412-126975-0009.flac, a house with a monkey tree. enough. you know the species. i really think my imitation of dickens' style was dexterous and literary. it seems almost a pity.
6892,412-126975-0048.flac," grout the man in the red tie. i shouldn't blame him if they had taken him. when they ask for bread, and you don't even give him a stone, i think they might take the stone for themselves."
6893,412-126975-0002.flac," i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself. choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe, as if for a statuary group."
6894,412-126975-0094.flac," went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. the spectators were few, relations, one or two local friends,"
6895,412-126975-0040.flac," were unduly large in proportion to the house, and formed, as it were, a big room with the front door at one end, and the bottom of the staircase at the other. in front of the large hall-fire,"
6896,412-126975-0017.flac," here, she gave an exclamation of wonder, real or ritual, and looking up at the high garden wall above her, beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure."
6897,412-126975-0016.flac," for the fourth or fifth time that day, because the dog ate it. past unobtrusively down the lane of laurels, and into a glittering plantation of ever-greens behind."
6898,412-126975-0068.flac," what i say is, let's do something for the company tonight. not blacking faces are sitting on hats if you don't like those. but something of the sort. why couldn't we have a proper old english pantomime?"
6899,412-126975-0034.flac," who rubbed his big fur gloves together. long before this revelation was complete, the two big doors of the porch had opened in the middle, and colonel adams, father of the furry young lady,"
6900,412-126975-0063.flac," he'll black his face if that's what you mean, cried blount laughing. i don't doubt he'd black everyone else's eyes. i don't care. i'm not refined."
6901,412-126975-0080.flac," he's a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes. i can be harley-kin. that only wants long legs and jumping about. my friend florian phones, he's bringing the police costume. he's changing on the way."
6902,412-126975-0025.flac," and which is the right side of the wall, ask the young lady smiling. whichever side you are on, said the young man named crook."
6903,412-126975-0011.flac," it was perfectly incomprehensible, and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it. from this standpoint, the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable"
6904,412-126975-0053.flac," put in the priest in a low voice, to own your own suit. crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect. does one want to own suit, he asked. one might."
6905,412-126975-0024.flac," i never know what you will say or do next,"" she said. ""'i don't often know myself,' replied mr. crook. but then i am on the right side of the wall now."""
6906,412-126975-0081.flac," we can act it in this very hall. the audience sitting on those broad stairs opposite, one row above another. these front doors can be the back scene, either open or shut. shut?"
6907,412-126975-0050.flac," a saint said father brown. i think,"" said sir leopold, with a supercellius smile, that ruby means a socialist."
6908,412-126975-0047.flac," but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them. i might have lost them on the road here. it was quite possible. quite natural, i should say."
6909,412-126975-0031.flac," which was rather a long process. a large, neat chauffeur in green got out from the front, and a small, neat man-servent in gray got out from the back. and between them, they deposited sir leopold on the doorstep,"
6910,412-126975-0008.flac," i did it in a good old middle-class house near putney, a house with a crescent of carriage drive, a house with a stable by the side of it, a house with the name on the two outer gates."
6911,412-126975-0013.flac," but her figure was beyond conjecture, for she was so wrapped up in brown fur as it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur. but for the attractive face, she might have been a small toddler bear."
6912,412-126975-0051.flac," a radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes, remarked crook, with some impatience. and a conservative does not mean a man who preserves jam. neither, i assure you."
6913,412-126975-0060.flac," i'm sick at being such a nuisance, colonel,"" he said, with the cheery colonial conventions. but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here tonight on business? in point of fact it's florian."
6914,412-126975-0070.flac," and i find the things extinct. nothing but a lot of sniveling fairy plays. i want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages. and they give me princesses moralizing by moonlight, bluebirds,"
6915,412-126975-0055.flac," oh, splendid, cried ruby. oh, i wish you'd do it to this company. the boisterous canadian, mr. blount, was lifting his loud voice and applause."
6916,412-126975-0075.flac," haven't killed a policeman lately. blount frowned thoughtfully a space, and then smote his thigh. yes, we can, he cried. i've got florian's address here."
6917,412-126975-0078.flac," you must get someone else for pantalune. i will be pantalune, if you like,"" said colonel adams, taking his cigar out of his mouth, and speaking for the first and last time."
6918,412-126975-0069.flac," clown, columbine, and so on. i saw one when i left england at twelve years old, and it's blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since. i came back to the old country only last year."
6919,412-126975-0065.flac," don't let's quarrel. there are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat. dislike of the red-tied youth, born of his predatory opinions and evident intimacy with the pretty godchild,"
6920,412-126975-0064.flac," i like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat. not on mine, please,"" said sir leopold fisher, with dignity. well, well, observed crook, airily."
6921,412-126975-0058.flac," he was dusty looking and in afraid coat, evidently a common messenger. and if you gentlemen mr. blount, he asked, and held forward a letter doubtfully."
6922,412-126975-0072.flac," it's a better definition of socialism than some recently given. but surely the get-up would be too big a business. not a scrap, cried blound, quite carried away."
6923,412-126975-0073.flac," a harlequin aids the quickest thing we can do for two reasons. first, one can gag to any degree, and second, all the objects are household things."
6924,412-126975-0077.flac," almost dancing. i'll be columbine, and you shall be pantaloon."" the millionaire held himself stiff, with a sort of heath and solemnity. i think, my dear, he said."
6925,412-126975-0088.flac," prevented from smashing the old victorian luster chandeliers that he might cover himself with resplendent crystals. in fact, he would certainly have done so, had not ruby unearthed some old pantomime paste jewels."
6926,412-126975-0030.flac," had not heard of him. for in certain articles in the clarian, or the new age, sir leopold had been dealt with austerely. but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motorcar."
6927,412-126975-0067.flac," letting a top hat sit on you, for instance, said the socialist. now, now, now, cried the canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence. don't let spoil a jolly evening."
6928,412-126975-0085.flac," as always happens, the invention grew wilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had to create. the columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt."
6929,412-126975-0046.flac," i had to be careful of them coming down. they are the three great african diamonds called the flying stars, because they have been stolen so often. all the big criminals are on the track."
6930,412-126975-0003.flac," thus, squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak. while jews, on the other hand, should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless,"
6931,412-126975-0012.flac," opened on the garden with the monkey tree, and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day. she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes."
6932,412-126975-0026.flac," as they went together through the laurels toward the front garden, a motorhorn sounded thrice, coming nearer and nearer, and a car of splendid speed, great elegance."
6933,412-126975-0036.flac," or pasha's in egypt. with him was his brother-in-law, lately come from canada, a big and rather boisterous young gentleman farmer with a yellow beard by name james blount."
6934,412-126975-0035.flac," had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside. he was a tall, sunburned, and very silent man, who wore a red smoking cap like a fuzz, making him look like one of the english serders."
6935,412-126975-0074.flac," tables and towel horses and washing baskets and things like that. that's true, admitted crook, nodding eagerly and walking about. but i'm afraid i can't have my policemen's uniform."
6936,412-126975-0061.flac," that famous french acrobat and comic actor. i knew him years ago out west. he was a french canadian by birth. and he seems to have business for me, though i hardly guess what."
6937,412-126975-0076.flac," and he knows every costumeier in london. i'll phone him to bring a police dress when he comes, and he went bounding away to the telephone. oh, it's glorious, godfather!"
6938,6064-300880-0030.flac," he observed to mr. harmon. what is he making all the fuss about? inquired that gentleman, as the visitor again, applied himself forcefully to the bell. wants to see mr. remson."
6939,6064-300880-0005.flac," what's the matter with an old man makeup at the front door? just this. friend murphy on watch hauls out his little paper, and on the chance of it being me, slaps the wrist of anybody who appears on those steps."
6940,6064-300880-0031.flac," but the old bulldog of a butler won't let him put his nose inside the door. says his name is cartier, and he's come all the way from england to see him. england? not roddy cateray."
6941,6064-300880-0010.flac," plum in the dead center of nowhere, 13 miles from a railroad, fishing and hunting on the premises. reads like a real estate man's prospectus observed remson. this year, pursued harman."
6942,6064-300880-0015.flac, get yourself a car from the garage and motor to the bungalow. that's at the third corner of my little triangular piece of mountain and forest.
6943,6064-300880-0035.flac, decided the collar. argument followed while the chauffeur burled into the mechanism of his car. it ended by the englishman bestowing two dollars upon mr. murphy to get a message to mr. rimson containing a protest and an address.
6944,6064-300880-0028.flac," when he was restored to his feet and his breath, and the taxi had ceased to imitate fairfner the dragon, a tall figure in an extremely english ulster, which had hastily emerged from the rimsen front door, rushed down ten steps,"
6945,6064-300880-0036.flac, the two gentlemen then moved away in the extinguished taxi. tickets had been provided by the four thoughtful harmin. the fugitive was the first man in the parlor car.
6946,6064-300880-0013.flac," they won't thank you when they meet across the dinner table. oh, it isn't as bad as that. there'll be a mile apart. the leaves will be at the cottage. they get off at meredith and go in on the truck. the woods i'm sending to the island."
6947,6064-300880-0009.flac," tested it at every point and pronounced it perfect. but we've forgotten one point,"" said rimson at the end of the discussion. what's that? where do i go when i get out? where do you want to go?"
6948,6064-300880-0012.flac, one half won't know how the other half lives till they get there. i've loaned the place to both couples for a fortnight. it's a dead secret. neither couple knows where the other is going. they're on oath.
6949,6064-300880-0004.flac," why not dress apart and walk away in cognito? oh, certainly, ascent to the other with bitterness. put on a suit of tights and dive out of the conservatory window disguised as a net-keller man, i suppose."
6950,6064-300880-0024.flac," fortified by my accent, it is most convincing. that'll be cartarae. who? rodney cartarae. am i supposed to know him? rather?"
6951,6064-300880-0021.flac," i've got some things to attend to. now, about our jail-breaking scheme, i've got an emidment. how would it be if the taxi-i arrive in should catch fire at the psychological moment? can it be done?"
6952,6064-300880-0011.flac, i'm keeping open house for a special reason. two fellows i know are getting married tomorrow. it's a double wedding. it's also a double honeymoon. but they aren't on to that yet. harmon's clear brown eyes twinkled.
6953,6064-300880-0037.flac," and were shown into drawing room a at the upper end of the car. shortly after, another couple, also glistening as to garb, entered and took possession of drawing room b at the lower end of the car."
6954,6064-300880-0000.flac," five times mr. thomas harmon vainly rang the bell of the rimson mansion. while engaged upon the sixth variation, he became aware of a face in the window, scrutinizing him. all right, called the face."
6955,6064-300880-0016.flac," wouldn't know them if i did. any other agreeable surprises about the resort? no. oh, yes, i nearly forgot. there's a little friend of gloria green. girl, tired out."
6956,6064-300880-0007.flac," presently, you will be seen coming down again, unable to affect an entrance against the watchfulness of the faithful connor."
6957,6064-300880-0001.flac," layed up, inquired mr. harmon, shaking hands, bottled up, answered the young man gloomily. can i help? possibly. did you ever kill a subpoena server?"
6958,6064-300880-0002.flac, not yet. care to try? what does the thing look like? cast your eyes toward the avenue and you'll see one.
6959,6064-300880-0032.flac, it was done almost as well as that accomplished actor mr. jacob remson could have done it. harmon's spraying across the street.
6960,6064-300880-0033.flac, he called. what on earth are you doing over here? the bell-ringer adjusted a monocle and ambled down the steps to shake hands.
6961,6064-300880-0017.flac," too much gayity or something. don't know what it is or who she is, but she's up against it for a month's rest, so miss green wished her on boulder brook and welcome. where does she go? inquired rimsons suspiciously."
6962,6064-300880-0034.flac, perhaps you can tell me what's amiss with this beastly house. i'll tell you! profit the obliging and innocent mr. murphy. he did so. did not i just go back and jolly well-cant there till somebody jolly well lets me in?
6963,6064-300880-0003.flac, he never asks questions about other people's troubles. he now visit himself and thought. haven't you any of your amateur theatrical duds here? was the outcome of his cogitations? all of them.
6964,6064-300880-0018.flac," to the cave, or the castle, or the crags, or the haunted manor house, or the co-educational club, or which one of the numerous institutions you maintain in your private city. she goes to the farmhouse."
6965,6064-300880-0023.flac," you'll see the englishist look in englishman you ever set eyes on outside the pages of punch, trying to tear my old-fashioned doorbell out by the roots. that's your best makeup, is it, remson?"
6966,6064-300880-0029.flac," and leisurely climbed them again, was wrenching violently at the bell. for a time, mr. murphy regarded him distinctly, then crossed over, held brief colloquy, and returned. hot chansey's got of breaking in!"
6967,6064-300880-0019.flac," mrs. bond, my housekeeper is looking after her. seclusion is her watchword. if you see her, make a noise like a dry leaf and blow away. you'll go, won't you? rimson meditated."
6968,6064-300880-0026.flac," him, i mean, and take him to the 9 o'clock train for boulder book in my taxi. rytow old thing be here at 830. cheerio said his host, britishly."
6969,6064-300880-0025.flac," not no a man with whom you toured for two months in japan?"" said rimsun, reproachfully, stupid of me! confessed harmon, grinning. carter ray, good old rottie, certainly! then i'd better capture you!"
6970,6064-300880-0022.flac," easily. i'm not a manufacturer of chemicals for nothing. great! keep it going for 10 seconds for the benefit of the watchful murphy, and if you look up after that,"
6971,6064-300880-0020.flac," it certainly seems made to order, and it's mighty good of you old man. yes, i'll just take you up on that. there's a train at 9 o'clock in the morning, tomorrow. make it the day after."
6972,6064-300880-0008.flac," i get you. i'm to be in disguise. but how shall we get the process, server off guard? leave that to me. the two conspirators elaborated their plan, built it up, revised it,"
6973,6064-300880-0014.flac," they climb out at ashland and go over by boat. unless they all happen to take the same train, one pair won't even know the others around until they meet up on the lake or in the woods. sounds like a party. doesn't it? want to join?"
6974,6064-300880-0006.flac, merely a matter of distracting friend murphy's attention for 10 seconds. at the end of the 10 seconds you will be seen going up the steps to the front door.
6975,6064-300880-0027.flac," from its window emerged a heavy puff of smoke. from its door emerged mr. thomas harmon, who rolled upon the pavement, apparently strangling. mr. murphy rushed to his aid."
6976,6064-300880-0038.flac," the allooter of justice eyed them and drew his own conclusions. here we are. all of us, he said to himself, retiring discreetly behind his newspaper."
6977,6064-56165-0034.flac," how can you criticize edith's brother? don't let her do it, edith."" ""'it doesn't trouble me,' answered the placid edith. ""'i know all about philip, and he's good enough for me.'"" ""'that's right,' said nora."
6978,6064-56165-0005.flac," i should say not,"" exclaimed nora, but bell, who had some new york cousins, was silent. brenda, however, noticing bell's expression, and not feeling disposed to side completely with nora, said."
6979,6064-56165-0017.flac, he only looked at little sheepish. the other fella said.
6980,6064-56165-0035.flac," he says there are two or three fellows just sponging off a philip all the time, and philip is too good nature to say anything. i wonder how he'll like julia,"" said edith."
6981,6064-56165-0003.flac," and he would grow almost enthusiastic when describing the tussle between ned brown and stanley hooper over the respective merits of boston and new york, in which hooper, the new yorker, was terribly beaten. and upon my word, he concluded,"
6982,6064-56165-0020.flac," although he had belonged to the illustrious organization a very short time. well, i think you're perfectly hoard, cried brenda. i mean the dickie. i've heard about the way you make people suffer, brand in them with hot cigars and making them run barefoot, winter nights and"
6983,6064-56165-0010.flac," philip looked over his shoulder in the glass. there was nothing to matter with his own shapely nose, and i doubt that he would have run any such risk as edith suggested. perhaps this was the reason why philip was not a fighter."
6984,6064-56165-0028.flac," she's invited to my cooking party next week,"" said nora. you know that you've accepted too, so you'll see her. oh, yes, by the way,"" said philip, what evening is it. friday, of course, replied nora."
6985,6064-56165-0029.flac," so we can sit up late without thinking about school the next day. well, you'll see me sure,"" said philip. but see here, it's five o'clock now, and i have an engagement downtown."
6986,6064-56165-0013.flac," how funny you are, edith, said bill. you never hear anything. hasn't anyone told you how the other fellows made him run blindfolded in his shirt sleeves down beacon street? no, really?"
6987,6064-56165-0015.flac," oh, it gives a fellow a chance to show what kind of stuff he's made of, explain philip, whether he has good manners and whether he's clever and all that. there must be better ways of showing bravery."
6988,6064-56165-0006.flac," you're terribly narrow, nora, to think that nobody's any good unless he comes from boston. i didn't say so, replied nora. no, but that's what you mean, and i'm surprised, philip blair."
6989,6064-56165-0024.flac," interrupted philip, i've heard that some professors say that their annex classes do better work than ours, but anybody can tell that that's all right. i believe it's all perfectly true,"" said nora."
6990,6064-56165-0014.flac," and everybody looking at him. oh, said one girl. and, ah, said another. and how silly they all cried together. if girls amuse themselves like that, what fun you'd make of us said the practical nora."
6991,6064-56165-0032.flac," and it was not often that he condescended to spend as long a time in their presence, as had been the case this afternoon. do you think that philip looks very well, edith?"
6992,6064-56165-0012.flac," o say, did you hear about the time will harden had with the dickey last week?"" he asked. nora nodded. she too had a brother in college. what was it, asked edith? you haven't told me, philip."
6993,6064-56165-0033.flac," replied philip's sister. it seems to me he was just a little pale. he is always pale,"" said edith. do you suppose he sits up too late? ask brenda. i want he doesn't study too much,"" said bell."
6994,6064-56165-0023.flac," oh see here, it would just spoil everything to have women in the classes with us. are you afraid they'd get ahead of you? asked edith gently? now look here, edith."
6995,6064-56165-0009.flac," how queer girls are. do you always fight like this when you're together? we don't fight like you boys, answered edith, good humoredly. we don't knock each other down and run the risk of breaking one another's noses."
6996,6064-56165-0022.flac," oh, they hate to see these girls going about with books and trying to get into harvard. yes, trying to break down the walls,"" said nora, sarcastically."
6997,6064-56165-0031.flac," though only about four years their senior, he seemed much older than brenda and her friends. years before they had all been playmates together, but his two years in college had taken him away from them."
6998,6064-56165-0011.flac," there was one good thing about the little disputes in which brenda and belle indulged. they very seldom lasted long. in the present instance, the girls were ashamed of having shown temper before philip."
6999,6064-56165-0021.flac," there are a lot of girls studying in cambridge now at the annex, and the fellows don't like it at all. well, i declare, exclaimed nora, i'd like to know what difference it makes to them."
7000,6064-56165-0030.flac," philip hurried off bowing in a very grown-up way to the group of girls. for whatever criticisms anyone might make about philip's indolence and disinclination to study, no one could deny that he had very good manners."
7001,6064-56165-0004.flac, i wasn't sorry. for the new york said is getting just unbearable. i wouldn't so much mine fighting stanley hooper myself about new york and boston. i guess i'd show him that new york isn't the whole world.
7002,6064-56165-0026.flac," does julia wear glasses or look green? i beg your pardon, brenda. no, she doesn't,"" said nora shortly. she's about the nicest girl i know. oh, she is lovely. add it, edith."
7003,6064-56165-0018.flac," he walked off as nice as you please. wasn't he mad at the two fellows for taking him there? of course not. that's a part of the thing. why, there are fellows in cambridge who would go through fire and water."
7004,6064-56165-0000.flac," he was a harvard sophomore and realized his own importance quite as much as the girls did. but still, there was always the chance that he would come into the room just for a minute and tell them some of the latest cambridge news."
7005,6064-56165-0016.flac," said the practical edith, i don't believe you know a bit more about will harden's bravery than he did before. we knew something about his manners. what? why, when he saw where he was, he didn't run away or flunk out."
7006,6064-56165-0025.flac," well, i wish myself that our english instructor hadn't such a fondness for reading themes to us that the girls have written. he makes out that they are better than ours, but i can't say that i see it myself. who gets the best marks?"
7007,6064-56165-0036.flac," hastily interposed bell. boys never like a girl who studies, especially one who is going to college."" well, julia is just a nicest girl i know,"" said nora, repeating the words she had used to fill up."
7008,6064-56165-0001.flac," he would have scorned to call it gossip. if there was any one thing in the world, he hated. so he said. it was girls' talk, this jabbering about nothing. for his part, he wouldn't waste his time that way."
7009,6064-56165-0008.flac," no, that's just it. you don't treat her decently."
7010,6064-56165-0007.flac," well, you'd better talk brenda barlow, broken nora again. just see the way you treat julia. if she'd been born in boston, i don't treat her, interrupted brenda."
7011,6064-56165-0002.flac," yet, when he had an appreciative audience, and girls generally appreciated what philip said. he would often spend as much as half an hour talking about the fellows."
7012,6064-56165-0019.flac," or stand on their heads in front of a pulpit for the sake of getting into the dicky, i tell you we make some of them suffer."
7013,6064-56165-0027.flac," a matter of opinion, murmured bell, under her breath. you don't mean to say you haven't seen her, cried brenda in surprise. no, i haven't happened to. answered philip."
7014,6064-56168-0003.flac, the girls were making up little groups to go to the game with use of their acquaintance as escorts under the shapironi jvolder people. a few who had received no invitation were especially miserable and took no trouble to disguise their feelings.
7015,6064-56168-0027.flac," when the tongues of half a dozen girls are vigorously discussing people and events, of which the listener has not the slightest knowledge. ruth herself was very independent."
7016,6064-56168-0008.flac," except the two speakers, if it were someone we might not care to have. and if that's the case, i declare it's too bad,"" said bell. if it's anything like that, broken brenda rather snappishly, i will just tell edith what i think."""
7017,6064-56168-0033.flac," oh dear, i can hardly wait for saturday. i know it,"" replied brenda. it's less than a week, too. but it seemed an awful long time."
7018,6064-56168-0012.flac," ruth roberts is as pleasant a girl as there is in school. and yet she would have a terribly lonely time, if it were not for edith and julia, nobody else ever thinks of speaking to her. well, why should we?"
7019,6064-56168-0010.flac," you need not look so surprised, rejoined nora, and if you take my advice, you will not see anything to eat it. she ought to have her own way in arranging her own party, and you know when she makes a permined it is of no use to talk to her about it."
7020,6064-56168-0029.flac," had undertaken to prepare for college, and it had been a great delight to her to have the latter placed with her in one or two special classes. julia's liking for her had made edith take a little more interest in her than would otherwise have been the case."
7021,6064-56168-0023.flac," ruth was a pretty and amiable girl, about julia's age, and therefore a little older than the four. she had been in the school for two years before the coming of julia, but in all that time she had had only a speaking acquaintance with the other girls."
7022,6064-56168-0013.flac," yes, that's what i think, too. nora smiled pleasantly, and her eyes looked brighter than ever under the rim of her brown feltat, with its trimmings of lighter brown. nora's temper was not easily ruffled, and she was so happy."
7023,6064-56168-0005.flac," and even occasionally from brenda, both of whom were inclined to be more exclusive. so it happened that the general harmony of the four was somewhat disturbed when nora, one day at recess, exclaimed, who do you suppose is going with us to the game?"
7024,6064-56168-0031.flac," was so annoyed by bell's proposed championship of princeton that she was unexpectedly cordial to ruth, and almost to her own surprise, found herself urging ruth to come to town early on the saturday of the game to take lunch in with her and julia."
7025,6064-56168-0007.flac," why, who is it, cride brenda, and who is it, echoed bell? i know that you can't guess. oh, don't be silly, nora. it wouldn't be worthwhile to guess about something you'll know all about so soon."
7026,6064-56168-0030.flac," no one who saw the hearty way in which nora and brenda greeted ruth, as she came up with edith and julia, could for a moment have imagined that she had been under discussion. the mercurial brenda for the moment"
7027,6064-56168-0018.flac," i am going to get an orange scarf and perhaps an orange flag. what for? why, i never heard of such a thing, exclaim nora. nora i, cried brenda, at a harvard game."
7028,6064-56168-0002.flac," and those who had relatives in the team were too proud for anything, as brenda said. the game was to be played in holmes field, and tickets were not easy to get, because the seats were far less numerous than now on the great soldiers field."
7029,6064-56168-0015.flac," but i don't see, turning rather snappishly towards brenda, why the rest of us have got to take up ruth roberts just because your cousin julia is so devoted to her. now this was a little too much, even for brenda."
7030,6064-56168-0006.flac," for, of course, in the minds of the others, there could be but one game."
7031,6064-56168-0032.flac," the latter expressed her thanks and a glance towards her cousin, as ruth accepted very gracefully, and nora exclaimed, what fun we are going to have!"
7032,6064-56168-0014.flac," then bill added a final word. oh, it's clear that this is all julius doings."
7033,6064-56168-0020.flac," why, it's a duty to do everything you can to help your own side. i never said that harvard was my side, interrupted bill. didn't i tell you that i have a cousin on the princeton team? you'd better not say anything of that kind to philip."
7034,6064-56168-0022.flac," walking away from nora and brenda. i do not need to be told what to do. what nora or brenda might have answered, i cannot say. for hardly had bell disappeared within the house, when edith herself appeared with julia and ruth."
7035,6064-56168-0019.flac," i should call it very impolite if there were no orange flags shown at the game. well, you have the most ridiculous ideas, hasn't she, brenda? brenda nodded as scent, and nora continued."
7036,6064-56168-0016.flac," and anyway, i'm thankful to have julia take a fancy to anybody. it leaves us a great deal freer to do as we like. i should think that you would see that yourself."" ""'oh, well,' said nora, laughing. the whole thing is not worth quarreling about."""
7037,6064-56168-0025.flac," ruth lived in the suburbs, and, as bill had said, outside of school the other girls seldom saw her. at recess, each little group had so many personal things to talk about that an outsider would have been decidedly in the way."
7038,6064-56168-0017.flac," yes, i know, but still. the least said the soonest mended,"" said nora, though to tell you the truth, the quotation did not sound especially appropriate. the least said the soonest mended."
7039,6064-56168-0026.flac," and would, perhaps, have been a little uncomfortable in joining them. no one gets a great deal of enjoyment from reading a single chapter in the middle of a book, and so it is often hard to be a mere listener"
7040,6064-56168-0021.flac," or to eat it either. they are both perfectly devoted to harvard, and they expect their party to give great encouragement to the harvard team. oh, i bell, i cannot imagine you're doing anything else. i'm not a child! responded bell very crossly."
7041,6064-56168-0028.flac," she had acquired the habit of studying during recess. since after school she spent more time than most girls of her age in outdoor sports. it did her no great harm to pass the half hour of recess in this way. ruth, as well as julia."
7042,6064-56168-0000.flac," for a week before thanksgiving, there was great excitement among the schoolgirls on account of the approaching football game. the four were as excited as the others, although not so many of their own particular friends were in the harvard team."
7043,6064-56168-0024.flac, that they were very selfish in leaving their schoolmates so entirely to herself. it was not because they did not like her. there were merely so very much wrapped up in their own affairs that they hardly noticed that she was often left to herself.
7044,6064-56168-0001.flac," it was to be a game with princeton, one of the great university matches, and for special reasons there was the deepest interest in the match. those girls who had brothers in college, or even cousins or friends, held themselves with more dignity than any of the others."
7045,6064-56168-0011.flac," it's hard enough to have julia tagging about everywhere, but why in the world we should have ruth roberts? when we never see her anywhere except at school, i really cannot understand, and i don't see how you and nora can like it either. why?"
7046,6064-56168-0009.flac," it! that! cried nora. didn't i say that it was a person, a girl, if i must be more definite? ruth roberts, if i must tell just who it is. oh! cried bell. and ah! echoed brenda."
7047,6064-56168-0004.flac," who had not been invited elsewhere to go in some other party. now edith was of a generally generous disposition, and not inclined to limit her favors of whatever nature to any particular set of girls."
7048,6272-70191-0034.flac," it was the custom, and father took his hat off to thank his friends for their sympathy and attention. his lips moved, but no words were audible. the procession moved down the path again."
7049,6272-70191-0033.flac," slanting backward and forward in protest against the folly of indicating what was no longer beneath them. the mounds were covered with mats of scanty, tangled grass, and here and there a rank spot of green."
7050,6272-70191-0036.flac," and not a soul was there when we went in. the duties of friendship and tradition had been fulfilled. the neighbors had gone home to their vacations. for the public, the tragedy was over. all speculation on the degree of our grief,"
7051,6272-70191-0037.flac," or our indifference was settled. we could take off our morning garments and our morning countenance, now that we were alone. or we could give way to that anguish we were afraid and ashamed to show, except before the one."
7052,6272-70191-0035.flac," arthur's hand was in mine. he stamped his feet firmly on the sand, as if to break the oppressive silence, which no one seemed as opposed to disturb. the same ceremonies were performed in starting us homeward."
7053,6272-70191-0019.flac," were the house be empty? yes. good, i can walk through it once more. the dead must be buried. that is certain. but why should it be certain that i must be the one to do it? you think i can go through with it then?"
7054,6272-70191-0026.flac," that some considerate friend took him out, and aunt morris wept so violently that she grew faint and cut hold of me. i gave her the flasken of salts, which revived her, but i felt as far the looked. stern."
7055,6272-70191-0002.flac," who were too distantly related to consider themselves as mourners to be shut up with us. it was put under rigorous funeral law, and inspected from garrett to seller. they supervised all the arrangements."
7056,6272-70191-0032.flac," we left the carriage at the paling and walked up the narrow path, among the mounds, where every stone was marked, mortgerson. some so old that they were stained with blotches of yellow moss, and were so old that they were stained with blotches of yellow moss."
7057,6272-70191-0005.flac," they reiterated the character, the peculiarities, the virtues of the mother i had lost, who could never be replaced, who was in a better world. however, i was, in a measure,"
7058,6272-70191-0021.flac," i think we might kiss each other now,"" she said. i opened my arms, holding her against my breast so tightly that she drew back, but kissed my cheek gently, and took from her pocket."
7059,6272-70191-0001.flac," though i am sure the performers thereof had small encouragement, veronica lone would see no one. her room was the only one not invaded, for the neighbors took the house into their hands, assisted by that part of the mortgazons."
7060,6272-70191-0031.flac, and rode up a little hill where the sand was so deep that it muffled the wheels and feet of the horses. the whole round of the grey sky was visible. it hung low over us. i wished it to drop and blot out the vague nothings under it.
7061,6272-70191-0008.flac," which he had imparted to her of an arch. it must be made of black marble with gold veins, and ought to stand in egypt with the word pandemonium on it. the kitchen was the focus of interest to him."
7062,6272-70191-0004.flac," i endure the same annoyances over and over again, from relays of people. bedtime especially was their occasion. i was not allowed to undress alone. i must have drinks, either, to compose or stimulate."
7063,6272-70191-0020.flac, i have set your behavior down to your will. you might be right. perhaps mother was always right about me too. she was against me. she looked at me with a timidity and an apprehension that made my heart bleed.
7064,6272-70191-0015.flac," is this like her?"" she asked, showing me a drawing. how could you have done this? because i have tried. is it like? yes, the idea."
7065,6272-70191-0003.flac," her course was taken for granted. mine was imposed upon me. i revinstreated with temperance, but she replied that it was all well-ment, and always done."
7066,6272-70191-0025.flac," they seemed to fall on the coffin in dull strife with his inmate whom mutely contradicted them. a discourse followed, which was calculated to harrow the feelings to the utmost. arthur began to cry so nervously"
7067,6272-70191-0022.flac," a flasso of sorts, which he fastened to my bed by its little chain, and said again, go! but recalling me said,"
7068,6272-70191-0013.flac, coming into my room dressed for the funeral. no.
7069,6272-70191-0007.flac," things would go well,"" he said. for everybody must expect to die then, the bible says so. he informed me also that he expected to be an architect, and that mother liked it. he had an idea."
7070,6272-70191-0009.flac," for meals were prepared at all hours for comers and goers. temperance told me that the mild and indifferent mourners were fond of good-victuels, and she thought their hearts were lighter than their stomachs when they went away."
7071,6272-70191-0029.flac," at last the word was given, and the long procession began to move through the street which was deserted. a cat ran out of the house and scampered across the way. arthur laughed, and father jumped nervously at the sound of his laugh."
7072,6272-70191-0023.flac," the landing-stair was full of people. i locked the door and took out the key. the stairs were crowded. all made way from me with a silent respect. aunt murs, when she saw me,"
7073,6272-70191-0016.flac," but what a picture she had attempted to make. mother's shadowy face serenely looked from a high, small window, set in clouds, like those which gather over the sun when it draws water."
7074,6272-70191-0024.flac," put her hand on an empty chair beside father who sat by the coffin. those passages in the bible which contained the beautifully poetic images relating to the going of manned, whose long home were read, and to my ear"
7075,6272-70191-0000.flac, we sat in state to be condolred with and waited upon.
7076,6272-70191-0027.flac," and anxious to escape the unprofitable trial. as the coffin was taken out to the hearse, my heart twisted and palpitated, as if a command had been laid upon it to follow and not leave her."
7077,6272-70191-0028.flac," when the hers moved down the street, father, arthur, and i were called, and assisted in her own shades, as if we were helpless. the reins were put in father's hands, and the horse was led behind the hers."
7078,6272-70191-0006.flac," kept for myself during this interval. the matter is often subservient to the manner. arthur's feelings were played upon also. he wept often, confiding to me his grief and his plans for the future."
7079,6272-70191-0018.flac," keep it, but don't work on it anymore. and i put it away. she was wawn and languid, but collected. i see you already. somebody must bury the dead. go."
7080,6272-70191-0030.flac," the graveyard was a mile outside the village. a sandy plain where a few stunted pines transplanted from the woods near it, struggled to keep alive. as we turned from the street into the lane, which led to it,"
7081,6272-70191-0010.flac, because he looked so grief struck. on the mercs was engaged with the dressmaker and with the orders for bonnets and veils. she discussed the subject of the morning with the morgansons. i acquiesced in all her arrangements.
7082,6272-70191-0011.flac, for she derived a simple comfort from these external tokens. veronica refused to wear the bonnet and veil and the required bombazine. bombazine made her flesh crawl. why should she wear it? mother hated it too.
7083,6272-70191-0012.flac," for she had never worn out the garments made for grand thur warren. she's a bigger child than ever, temperature-marked, and must have her way."
7084,6272-70191-0014.flac," the yard is full of carriages already. somebody handed me gloves. my bonnet was tied, a handkerchief given to me, and the door opened. in the passage i heard a knocking from veronica's room, and crossed to learn what she wanted."
7085,6272-70191-0017.flac," it was closely pressed to the glass, and she was regarding dark, indefinite creatures below it."
7086,6272-70168-0031.flac," though the fire had gone out, the lamps winked brightly, and father, moving his agar to the other side of his mouth, changed his regards from one lamp to the other, and said he thought i was going to be an attractive girl."
7087,6272-70168-0009.flac," did you experience any shadow of a change during the revival at barmouth? no more than the baby here did. i shall have faith, though."
7088,6272-70168-0022.flac," though the tall brass lamps glittered like gold, their circle of light was small. the corners of the room were obscure. mr. park, entering, retreated into one, and mother was obliged to forego the pleasure of undressing arthur."
7089,6272-70168-0017.flac," i grew blithe as i sought winking under the rays of the afternoon sun, and clapping my hands said i was glad to get home. we left veronica at the table, and mother resumed her conversation with me in a corner of the room."
7090,6272-70168-0000.flac," instead of my heart leaping for joy, as i had expected, a sudden indifference filled it. i felt averse to the chain from the narrow ways of barmouth, which, for the moment, i regret it."
7091,6272-70168-0001.flac," when i entered the house and saw mother in a old place, her surroundings unaltered, i suffered a disappointment. i had not had the power of transferring the atmosphere of my year's misery to surrey."
7092,6272-70168-0005.flac," the boy, by name charles, came to see the new arrival, but smitten with dividends crept under the table and examined me from his retreat."
7093,6272-70168-0024.flac," as he shook hands with me, i saw that his hair had whitened. he held a tassel cane between his knees and thumped the floor whenever he asked a question."
7094,6272-70168-0021.flac," say so to my own child. very turned her face to the wall and said no more, but he had started a less pleasant train of thought. it was changed again by temperance coming with lights."
7095,6272-70168-0023.flac," so she sent him off with temperance and trials, whose duty it was to rock the cradle as long as his baby ship required. soon after, father came, and haps he brought in his hot supper. while he was eating it, grandfather john morgensen bustled in."
7096,6272-70168-0016.flac, she was too much engaged in conversation to fulfill her duties that way.
7097,6272-70168-0006.flac," inquired mother. he is getting his double teeth. oh, yes! and where's veronica? she's up-guarrett writing geography, and told me nothing in the world must disturb her, till she had finished an account of the city of palmery."
7098,6272-70168-0007.flac," to temperance. ""'colour when supper is ready,' replied mother, who asked me to come into the bedroom where arthur was sleeping. he was a handsome child, large and fair, and as i lifted his white, lax-fingers,"
7099,6272-70168-0004.flac, is it best to cook more mrs. morgensen?
7100,6272-70168-0012.flac," temperance brought arthur to the table half asleep, but he roused when she drummed on his plate with a spoon. hepsy was stationed by the benic, knife in hand, to serve it. as we began our meal,"
7101,6272-70168-0028.flac," and turned towards mother as if he would like to say, you understand bringing up children, don't you? she comprehended him, and giving her had a slight toss, told very to go and play on the piano. i was going, she answered petushly."
7102,6272-70168-0002.flac," i heard the wanton sound of the banging of doors. the doors at grandthers, i'm used, had lists nailed round their edges, but then he had the list being a tailor. hoi-vom said temperance with her hand on her hip."
7103,6272-70168-0010.flac, because you have had the blessing of so good a man as your grand-ther. but i never heard a word of grand-thirst prayers. do you remember his voice?
7104,6272-70168-0030.flac," joe bacon. mother retired. vary still played. a talent is wonderful,"" said father, taking to the gar from his mouth. by the way, you must take lessons in milford. i wish you would learn to sing."
7105,6272-70168-0003.flac," and not offering to approach me. her hair is as thick as a mop. hempsey rubbing her fingers against her thumb, remarked that she hoped learning had not taken away my appetite."
7106,6272-70168-0011.flac," my hearing him or not would make no difference since god could hear and answer. grandther does not like me. i never pleased him. she looked astonished, then reflective."
7107,6272-70168-0020.flac," i feel evil still. you know, turning to me, that my temper is worse than ever. it is like a tiger's. oh, fairy,"" said mother, but quite so bad. you are too hard upon yourself."
7108,6272-70168-0025.flac," and mother listened with a vague, respectful attention. her hand was pressed against her breast, as if she were repressing an inward voice which claimed her attention."
7109,6272-70168-0013.flac," veronica came in from the kitchen with a plate of toasted crackers. she set the plate down, and gravely shook hands with me, saying she had concluded to live entirely on toast, but supposed i would eat all sorts of food, as usual."
7110,6272-70168-0034.flac," as i passed to the upper entry, veronica opened her door. she was unrest, and had a little book in her hand, which she shook at me, saying,"
7111,6272-70168-0015.flac," and ate it in silence. the plenty around me, the ease and independence gave me a delightful sense of comfort. the dishes were odd, some of china, some of delph, and were continually moved out of their places for we helped ourselves."
7112,6272-70168-0014.flac," her face was still long and narrow, but prettier, and her large, dark eyes had a slight cast, which gave her face an indescribable expression. distant? indifferent and speculative as the eyes were."
7113,6272-70168-0019.flac," the glutton, but he has not been here long. they are also when they first come. she then gave him a large slice of the cake. veronica, contrary to her want."
7114,6272-70168-0029.flac," and darted out a moment after we heard her. grandfather went, and presently mr. park got up in a lingering way."
7115,6272-70168-0018.flac," presently, temperance came in with charles, bringing fresh plates. as soon as they began their supper, veronica's temperance how the fish tasted. is it salt? middling. how is the bannock? excellent."
7116,6272-70168-0026.flac," her hair dropped on her shoulder and looked like a brown, coiled serpent. veronica, who had been silently observing her, rose from the sofa, picked up the comb, and fastened her hair without speaking. as she passed, she gave me a dark look."
7117,6272-70168-0008.flac," a torrent of love swept through me, and i kissed him. i am afraid i make an idol of him, cassie. are you unhappy because you love him so well, mother, and feel that you must make expiation? cassandra, she spoke with haste."
7118,6272-70168-0032.flac," a very strong relation of reserve generally existed between parent and child, instead of a confidential one. and the child was apt to discover that reserve, on the part of the parent, was not superiority, but cowardice, or indifference."
7119,6272-70168-0033.flac," let it not be so with us, was his conclusion. he threw away the stump of his cigar and went to fasten the hall door. i took one of the brass lamps, proposing to go to bed."
7120,6272-70168-0027.flac," eh, very, said father. are you there? were you glad to see cassie home again? should i be glad? what can she do? grandfather perched up his mouth."
7121,6272-70171-0003.flac," ross fell was larger and handsome-rhythmed, surrey. that is my house on the right,"" he said. we looked down the shady street through which we were going."
7122,6272-70171-0037.flac," telling him it was a likeness of her cousin rachel's husband. i replied we knew that grandfather had married a rachel's summers. cousin charles was surprised, and a little vexed that the doctor had never told him,"
7123,6272-70171-0034.flac," leaping so high that the artists seemed rattling from their backs. he struck them and said, go on now, go on devils! there was no further trouble. he encouraged mother not to be afraid, looking keenly at me."
7124,6272-70171-0035.flac," and the scholars, some sixty boys and girls, were coming downstairs from the hall to go into the rooms each side of a great door. dr. price was behind them. he stopped when he saw us, an introduction took place, and he inquired for dr. snell."
7125,6272-70171-0033.flac," and for the first time i saw his father smile on him. ""'these are fine broods,' he said, not taking his eyes from them. but they are not equal to my mare, nell. alice is afraid of her. but i hope that you, cassandra,"
7126,6272-70171-0030.flac," she was always making up some nice dish. tell her i remember it, will you? when cousin charles put us into the carriage, and hoisted little edward on the front seat, while the noticed that two men held the horses, and that they were not the same he had driven the night before."
7127,6272-70171-0017.flac," putting others of a planar make in their places shook down the window curtains, asked us if we would have anything more and quietly disappeared. i offered mother the warm water and appropriated the biscuits. there were six. i ate everyone."
7128,6272-70171-0006.flac, we were hardly seated when we heard a cry of a young child. she left the table hastily to come back in a moment with an apology which she made to cousin charles rather than to us. i had never seen a table so well arranged.
7129,6272-70171-0008.flac," the lamb chops were fragile, the bread was delicious, but cut in transparent slices, and the butterpad was nearly stamped through with its bouquet of flowers. this was all the feast except sponge cake, which felt like muslin in the fingers."
7130,6272-70171-0032.flac, that stood on their hind legs as often as that position was compatible with the necessity they were under of getting on. for they evidently understood that they were guided by a firm hand. edward was delighted with their behavior.
7131,6272-70171-0023.flac," and their mother was tending and watching them. the oldest was eight years, the youngest three months. cousin alice gave us descriptions of their tastes and habits, dwelling with emphasis on those of the baby."
7132,6272-70171-0015.flac," she could appreciate her anxiety and sadness in leaving me, mother thanked her warmly, and were sure that i should be happy. but i had an inward misgiving that i should not have enough to eat. ""'i hear edward,' said alice. good night."""
7133,6272-70171-0001.flac," i looked out on a tranquil, agreeable landscape. there was nothing saline in the atmosphere. the western breeze, which flew in our faces, had an earthy scent, with fluctuating streams of odours from trees and flowers."
7134,6272-70171-0041.flac," and that there was no congregational church in rossville. she went to boston that friday afternoon, anxious to get safely home with veronica. we parted with many a kiss and shake of the hand and last words."
7135,6272-70171-0012.flac," the furniture was dark, the mantle and table-tops were black marble, and the vases in candelabra were bronze. he directed mother's attention to the portraits of his children, explaining them."
7136,6272-70171-0019.flac," i think they would grumble and admire. look at this! showing her the tassels of the inner window curtains, done up in little bags. and the glasses pinned up with nice yellow paper."
7137,6272-70171-0005.flac," as mr. morganson introduced her. giving us a cordial welcome, she let us into a parlour where tea was waiting. a servant came in for a bonnet and baskets. cousin alice begged us to take tea at once."
7138,6272-70171-0014.flac," we should see her three children. she never left them. she was so afraid of their being ill, also telling mother that she would do all in her power to make my stay in rossville pleasant and profitable. as a mother,"
7139,6272-70171-0018.flac," undressing meanwhile and surveying the apartment. cassie, mrs. borgensen is an excellent housekeeper. yes, i said huskily, for the dry biscuit choked me. what would temperance and hepsie say to this?"
7140,6272-70171-0009.flac," i could have squeezed the whole of it into my mouth. still hungry, i observed that cousin charles and alice had finished, and though she shook her spoon in the cup, feigning to continue, and he snipped crumbs in his plate,"
7141,6272-70171-0004.flac," and a peaked roof, and on the side towards us a large yard and stables. we drove into the yard, and a woman came out on the piazza to receive us. it was mrs. borgensen, or my wife, cousin alice."
7142,6272-70171-0040.flac, think how much greater your advantages are than mine have ever been. how miserable was my youth. it is too late for me to make any attempt at cultivation. i have no wish that way.
7143,6272-70171-0027.flac," the ham was most savory, but cut in such thin slices that it curled, and the biscuits were white and featheriest snowflakes."
7144,6272-70171-0025.flac," put little edward in his chair, and breakfast began. ""'mr. morgenson,' said charles. ""'the horses will be ready to take you round rossville. we will call on dr. price for you to see the kind of master cassandra will have. i have already spoken to him about receiving a new pupil.'"
7145,6272-70171-0024.flac, i drew from her conversation the opinion that she had a tendency to the rearing of children. i was glad when cousin charles came in looking at his watch. send off the baby's alas and ring the bell for breakfast. she sent out the two youngest.
7146,6272-70171-0031.flac," she said she was a frank to-go. they looked ungovernable. but he reassured her, and one of the men avering that mr. morgensen could drive anything. she repressed her fears, and redrove out of the yard behind a pair of horses."
7147,6272-70171-0007.flac," so, for stidiously neat, it glittered with glass and french-china. kazenchaal sent away a glass and a plate, frowning at the girl who waited. there must have been a speck or a flaw in them. the vines were as prettiest the dishes."
7148,6272-70171-0021.flac, it was byron and turning over the leaves until i came to don juan. i read it through.
7149,6272-70171-0002.flac," as we passed through the town, the custom charles pointed to the academy, which stood at the head of a green. pretty houses stood round it, and streets branched from it in all directions. flower gardens, shrubbery and trees were scattered everywhere."
7150,6272-70171-0028.flac," kazanales gave unremitting attention to edward, who ate as little as the rest. mother, i said afterward,"
7151,6272-70171-0016.flac," presently a girl, the same who had taken our bonnets, came in with a pitcher of warm water and a plate of soda biscuit. she directed us where to find the apparel she had nicely smoothed and folded. took off the handsome counter-pain and the pillows trimmed with lace."
7152,6272-70171-0013.flac," dark and delicate, but to look at it may be shiver."" mother came toward us, pleading fatigued and excused for retiring, and cousin charles called cousin alice, who went with us to our room. in the morning, she said,"
7153,6272-70171-0020.flac," and here is a danisk napkin, fastened to the wall behind the washstand, and everything stands on a mat. i wonder if this is to be my room. it is probably the chamber for visitors. bye."
7154,6272-70171-0022.flac," which was not the one we had taken tea in, but a small apartment with a door opening into the garden."
7155,6272-70171-0029.flac," i noticed how elegant their table appointments were, and i shall buy new china in boston tomorrow. i wish hepsi would not load our table as she does. hepsi is a good woman, mother. do give my love to her. now that i think of it."
7156,6272-70171-0010.flac," i felt constrained to end my repost. he rose then, and pushing back the folding doors, we entered a large room, leaving alice at the table. windows extending to the floor, opening on the piazza."
7157,6272-70171-0026.flac," i said, mother tried in vain to look hard-hearted, and to persuade that it was good for me, but she lost her appetite with the thought of losing me, which the mention of dr. price brought home."
7158,6272-70171-0036.flac," as an old college friend. locke morganson sounded familiarly, he said. a member of his mother's family named summers had married a gentleman of that name. he remembered it from an old ivory miniature, which his mother had shown him."
7159,6272-70171-0039.flac," that i frankly told her i was 18 years old, very ignorant, and averse from learning. but i did not speak loud enough for anybody beside herself to hear. now,"" said mother, when we came away."
7160,6272-70171-0000.flac, chapter 14
7161,6272-70171-0038.flac," and we followed him to her schoolroom. i was at once interested and impressed by the imperates of my teacher that was to be. she was a dignified, kind-looking woman who asked me a few questions in such a pleasant direct manner"
7162,6272-70171-0011.flac," but notwithstanding the stream of light over the carpet, i thought it somber, and out of keeping with the cottage exterior."
7163,8465-246942-0010.flac," that would have no divisions of pride, no scattering of hate."
7164,8465-246942-0001.flac," her pulled ye on the scaffold, god in heaven, infinitely rather, which she poison herself and him. then she remembered how pleased and consoled he had been when she said something about their dying together, and that reassured her a little."
7165,8465-246942-0011.flac," which you might have carried home in gladness to her six-sold brother, to comfort and strengthen him."
7166,8465-246942-0014.flac," skeletons, they were, and no human beings at all. her father."
7167,8465-246942-0005.flac," then indeed, if there be no god, or one that has not an infinite power of setting right that which has gone wrong with his work, then indeed welcome the faith, for faith it may then be called, of such as say there is no hair after."
7168,8465-246942-0026.flac," helen was on her knees with her head on a chair, yet once more crying to the hearer of cries, possible or impossible, being she knew not in the least, but words reported of him had given birth to the cry, to help her in her dire need."
7169,8465-246942-0002.flac," but she must take care that foolish, extravagant carrot should not come near him. there was no knowing to what he might persuade him. poor poli was so easily led by any show of nobility, anything that looked grand or self-sacrificing."
7170,8465-246942-0007.flac," and some kind of refuge there does seem to be. strange it is and true that in publicity itself lies some relief from the knowing of the worm, as if even a cursing humanity were a barrier of protection between the torn soul and its crime."
7171,8465-246942-0018.flac," and therefore could not know the frightful consequences of such a confession as he had counseled. had she not better then tell him all, and so gather from him some right and reasonable advice for the soothing of the agonies of her poor, broken-winged angel?"
7172,8465-246942-0016.flac," and was he to go and confess it and be tried for it and be great god, and here was the priest actually counseling what was worse than any suicide."
7173,8465-246942-0004.flac," aganese of injury a man may endure, and so far from being overwhelmed. rise above them tenfold a man, who, were he to await to the self-knowledge of a crime, would sink into a heap of ruin."
7174,8465-246942-0003.flac, helen's only knowledge of guilt came from the pale image of it lifted above her horizon by the refraction of her sympathy. she did not know perhaps never would understand the ghastly horror of conscious guilt besides which there is no evil else.
7175,8465-246942-0013.flac, he had only spoken drearly of duty hinting at a whore that would plunge the whole ancient family into a hell of dishonor and contempt.
7176,8465-246942-0027.flac," instead of any word or thought, even coming to her that might be fancy to answer, she was scared from her knees by an approaching step."
7177,8465-246942-0006.flac, helen did not know to what gulfs of personal shame made to what summits of public execution. a man may be glad to flee for refuge from the fangs of home-born guilt. if so be there is any refuge to be found in either.
7178,8465-246942-0000.flac," she had sought the door of paradise, and the door of hell had been open to her. if the frightful idea which she did not doubt had already suggested itself to leopold, she had now been encouraged there was nothing but black madness before her."
7179,8465-246942-0019.flac," but alas, what security had she that a man capable of such priestly, severity and heartlessness?"
7180,8465-246942-0017.flac," suddenly, however, it occurred to her that the curate had had no knowledge of the facts of the case, and had therefore been compelled to talk at random. it was impossible he should suspect the crime of which her brother had been guilty."
7181,8465-246942-0008.flac," it flees to its kind for shelter from itself. hence, i imagine in part, may the coolness of some criminals be accounted for. their quietness is the relief brought by confession, even confession but to their fellows."
7182,8465-246942-0015.flac," if leopold had had her mother for his two instead of the dark-skinned woman with the flashing eyes, he would never have brought this upon them. it was all his mother's fault, the fault of her race, and of the horrible drug her people had taught him to take."
7183,8465-246942-0022.flac," and then serve her as the curet had done, he was indeed shameless. he would never have treated a poor wretched woman like that. and as she said thus to herself, again the word sounded in the ear of her heart."
7184,8465-246942-0024.flac," keeps for his own in every house that he builds. alas, so long and most human houses shut away from the rest of the rooms and forgotten, or recollected with uneasiness as a lumber closet in which lie too many things that had better not be looked into."
7185,8465-246942-0023.flac," come unto me, all ye that labor in our heavy laden, and i will give you rest."" once came the voice, from her memory, or from that inner chamber of the spirit, which the one spirit bearing spirit."
7186,8465-246942-0012.flac," and make him feel that after all there was yet a place for him in the universe, and that he was no outcast of gehenna. but instead of such words of gentle might like those of the man of whom he was so fond of talking,"
7187,8465-246942-0020.flac," no, she would venture no further. sooner would she go to george baskham, from whom she not only could look for no spiritual comfort, but whose theories were so cruel against culprits of all sorts."
7188,8465-246942-0009.flac," is it that the crime seems then lifted a little from their shoulders, and its weight shared by the aice? helen had hoped that the man who had spoken in public so tenderly, and at the same time so powerfully of the saving heart of the universe,"
7189,8465-246942-0025.flac," but what matter were the voice that had said them so long as the words were true, and she might believe them whatever is true can be believed of the true heart? air she knew."
7190,8465-246942-0021.flac," alas, alas, she was alone. absolutely alone in the great waste, death-eyed universe. but for a man to talk so of the tenderness of jesus christ,"
7191,8465-246943-0018.flac," yet she hesitated not a single moment in her administrations. there is so much passes in us of which our consciousness takes no grasp, or but with such a flitting touch as scarcely to hand it over to the memory."
7192,8465-246943-0024.flac," i will soon satisfy you, it could be no fancy. here he pushed her from him and looked straight in her eyes. i saw her back reflected in the mirror of the wardrobe door and..."
7193,8465-246943-0022.flac," nonsense, dear polly! it was all fancy, nothing more! she returned in a voice almost as hollow as his, and the lightness of the words uttered in such a tone jar dismayfully on her own ear. fancy, he repeated."
7194,8465-246943-0003.flac," what was that, polly, asked helen with a paying affair? why those words, of course, what else? you sang them to me afterwards, you know? helen."
7195,8465-246943-0027.flac," if indeed that be a possible source of courage, and it is not gathered rather from the hidden hope of which i speak, and the love that will cleave and not forsake, she set her teeth and said, let her come then, poldy. i'm with you and i defy her."""
7196,8465-246943-0002.flac," but at the same time he appeared more wasted and pinched and death-like than she had yet seen him. or was it only in her eyes? was she but reading in his face the agony she had herself gone through that day? helen, helen, he cried as she entered the room."
7197,8465-246943-0007.flac," oh, i wish i hadn't run away but had let them take me and hang me. helen felt herself grow white. she turned away and pretended to search for something she had dropped."
7198,8465-246943-0013.flac," indeed, was she not certain that such a man bringing the artillery of his fanaticism to bear upon her poor boy's wild enthusiastic temperament? would speedily persuade him to make a reality of that terrible thing he had already thought of that hideously impossible possibility?"
7199,8465-246943-0019.flac," that i feel encouraged to doubt whether ever there was a man absolutely without hope, that there have been alas, or many who are aware of no ground of hope, nay, even who feel no glimmer in them, of anything they can call hope i know."
7200,8465-246943-0010.flac," what is he therefore then?"" said leopold indignantly, and turned his face to the wall and moaned. helen had not yet thought of asking herself whether her love to her brother was all clear love and no wise minkled with selfishness."
7201,8465-246943-0017.flac," if the cruel power that had created him for such misery, whoever, whatever, wherever he might be."
7202,8465-246943-0023.flac," i know what fancy is as well as any man or woman born. that was no fancy. she stood there by the wardrobe in this same dress. her face is white as her dress, and listen, i will tell you."
7203,8465-246943-0026.flac," oh, i saw it in the mirror. his voice had risen to a strangled shriek. his face was distorted."
7204,8465-246943-0014.flac," it could not have been long, she thought."
7205,8465-246943-0016.flac," but in all she did for him, she felt like the executioner who gives restoratives to the wretch that has fainted on the rack or the wheel. what right had she, she thought, to multiply to him his moments of torture?"
7206,8465-246943-0025.flac," hear the fixed look of horror threatened to return upon his face, but he went on. listen."
7207,8465-246943-0008.flac," i don't think he would be of the slightest use to you,"" she said, still stooping. and she felt like a devil dragging the soul of her brother to hell. but that was the foolish fancy and must be resisted."
7208,8465-246943-0029.flac, but leopold seemed not to hear a word she said and lay with his face to the wall.
7209,8465-246943-0005.flac," was this what came of praying, she thought bitterly. something or other, i don't know what exactly returned leopold. oh helen, he broke out with a cry, stifled by the caution that had grown habitual to both of them."
7210,8465-246943-0021.flac," at length, leopold open desires."
7211,8465-246943-0011.flac," whether in the fresh horror that day poured into the cup that had seemed already running over, it was of her brother only she thought, or whether threaten shamed to herself had not apart in her misery."
7212,8465-246943-0004.flac, don't you think he might be able to do something?
7213,8465-246943-0009.flac," not if i told him everything?"" leopold hissed from between his teeth and the struggle to keep down his shriek. no, not if he told him everything, she answered, and felt like a judge condemning him to death."
7214,8465-246943-0001.flac, that glimmer on his countenance doubtful as the first of the morning when the traveler know is not whether the light be in the sky or only in his brain
7215,8465-246943-0000.flac," helen rose and hastened to her brother with a heart of lead in her body. she started when she saw him, some change had passed on him since the morning."
7216,8465-246943-0028.flac," she shall know that a sister's love is stronger than the hate of a jilt, even if you did kill her. before god pulled thee, i would after all rather be you than she. say what you will."
7217,8465-246943-0006.flac," is there no help of any kind anywhere? surely mr. wingfold could tell me something, comfort me somehow if i were to tell him all about it. i could trust the man that said such things as those you told me that i could."
7218,8465-246943-0015.flac," apparently senseless on the pillow, and she thought he was dead. the same moment she was free, the horror had departed from her own atmosphere too, and she made haste to restore him."
7219,8465-246943-0020.flac," but i think in them, all is an underlying unconscious hope. i think that not one in all the world has more than a shadowy notion of what hopelessness means. perhaps utter hopelessness is the outer darkness."
7220,8465-246943-0012.flac, for what attempt even had he made to comfort her? what had he done but utter common places and truisms about duty? and who could tell but?
7221,8465-246940-0028.flac," ever since leopold said the word jury, a ghastly fear had haunted helen. she pressed her hand on her heart and made no answer. i speak from experience the cure it went on. from what else could i speak?"
7222,8465-246940-0021.flac," therefore, surely the first step for anyone who has committed such a crime must be to humble himself before god, confess the sin, and ask forgiveness and cleansing."
7223,8465-246940-0001.flac," can you tell me, she said, from behind more veils than that of lace? how to get rid of a haunting idea that depends on the nature of the idea i should imagine answered the curate? such things sometimes arise merely from the state of the health."
7224,8465-246940-0027.flac," that the person of whom you speak is not neglecting something he ought to do, something he knows perhaps? he had come back to the same with which he started. through her veil he saw her turn deadly white."
7225,8465-246940-0008.flac," might it not be well, however, to try, if there is any to be had from him that said, come unto me, and i will give you rest. i can do nothing with that. i've tried and tried to pray, but it is of no use."
7226,8465-246940-0023.flac," then you think confession to god is all that is required? if there be no one else wrong to whom confession can be made, if the case were mine,"
7227,8465-246940-0015.flac," but what appeared to the cure at a long silence followed. at length she said with faltering voice. suppose it were a great wrong that had been done, and that was the unindurable thought. suppose, i say."
7228,8465-246940-0026.flac," she had gone much farther than she had intended, but the more doubtful help became, the more she was driven by the agony of a perishing hope to search the heart of winfold. again the cure it pondered. are you sure he said it length?"
7229,8465-246940-0018.flac," again, the cure it took time to reply. i am endeavouring to answer your questions as well as i can, he said, but it is hard to deal with generalities."
7230,8465-246940-0014.flac," possibly, there is something you ought to do and are not doing, and that is why you cannot rest. i think jesus would give no rest except in the way of learning of him. helen sob ceased."
7231,8465-246940-0024.flac," and sometimes i'm much fear that in taking holy orders i have grievously sinned, i should then do just as i have done with regard to that. cry to the living power which i think originated me, to set the matter right for me."
7232,8465-246940-0006.flac," i may be able to hint at some hope,"" said wingfold very gently. do you call yourself a christian? the question would, to most people, have sounded strange, abrupt, and quisitorial. but to helen is sounded not one of them all."
7233,8465-246940-0019.flac," you see how useless for that very reason my answers have as yet been. still, i have something more to say and hesitate only because it may imply more confidence than i dare profess, and of all things i dread untruth."
7234,8465-246940-0007.flac," no, she answered. ah, said the cured a little sadly and went on. because then i could have said, you know where to go for comfort."
7235,8465-246940-0029.flac," i know that so long as we hang back from doing what conscious urges, there is no peace for us. i will not say our prayers are not heard, for mr. paulworth has taught me that the most precious answer prayer can have."
7236,8465-246940-0013.flac," his help may be on the way to you or even with you, only you do not recognize it for what it is. i have known that kind of thing. tell me some fact or some feeling i can lay hold of."
7237,8465-246940-0005.flac," then give me some food, some hope i mean, and try me again. without that, i don't care about duty or life or anything. tell me then, what is the matter?"
7238,8465-246940-0022.flac," and the creature he has made. and if god heard the man's prayer and forgave him, then the man would certainly know it in his heart and be consoled, perhaps by the gift of humility."
7239,8465-246940-0017.flac," here the answer was not so plain and the cure it had to think. at least, he said at length, you could confess the wrong and ask forgiveness."
7240,8465-246940-0004.flac," you wouldn't talk about work to a man dying of hunger, would you? i'm not sure about that. he wouldn't heed you. perhaps not. what would you do then? give him some food. and try him again, i think."
7241,8465-246940-0000.flac," it was some moments before either of them spoke, and it did not help wingfold that she sat clouded by a dark colored veil. at length he said, you must not fear to trust me because i doubt my ability to help you. i can at least assure you of my sympathy."
7242,8465-246940-0009.flac," i suppose it is because i cannot believe there is anyone hearing a word i say. yesterday, when i got to lone in the park, i prayed aloud."
7243,8465-246940-0030.flac," lies in the growing strength of the impulse toward the dreaded duty, and in the ever-sharpenstings of the conscience. i think i asked already whether there were no relatives to whom reparation could be made. yes, yes, guest, helen."
7244,8465-246940-0011.flac, she tried hard but could not prevent a sob.
7245,8465-246940-0012.flac," will you not tell me something about it?"" said the curate, yet more gently."
7246,8465-246940-0002.flac," and there the doctor is the best help. helen shook her head and smiled behind her veil aggrievous smile. the curate paused, but, receiving no assistance ventured on again. if it be a thought of something past and gone,"
7247,8465-246940-0020.flac, for surely there cannot be any other kind of god than the father of jesus christ.
7248,8465-246940-0010.flac," i thought that perhaps even if he might not be able to read what was in my heart, he might be able to hear my voice. i was even foolish enough to wish i knew greek because perhaps he would understand me better if i were to pray in greek."
7249,8465-246940-0003.flac," for which nothing can be done. i think activity in one's daily work must be the best aid to endurance. oh dear, oh dear,"" said helen, when one has no heart to endure and hates the very sunlight."
7250,8465-246940-0025.flac," then, to forgive and console me. alas, alas, that he will not hear of. he would rather be punished than consoled. i fear for his brain. but indeed, that might be well."
7251,8465-246940-0016.flac," that was what made me miserable. then you must, of course, make all possible reparation answered wingfold at once. but if none were possible, what then?"
7252,8465-246940-0031.flac, and i told you your reparation was impossible. her voice had sunk almost to a groan.
7253,8465-246947-0027.flac," and another comes diving after him. it isn't for me to say how he is to take hold of me. no, helen, when i trust, i trust out and out. helen's side, thinking how ill that had worked with emma line."
7254,8465-246947-0011.flac," her love and her conscience were not yet at one with each other. they parted at the door from the garden and she returned to the stick room. she paused, hesitating to enter. all was still as the grave. she turned the handle softly and peeped in."
7255,8465-246947-0024.flac," he hasn't got a secret like us, helen. he had it sadly. what did he say to you? what he said to you from the pulpit the other day i should think. and she was right. for all his hardness and want of sympathy, the curate had yet had regard to her in treaties"
7256,8465-246947-0004.flac," and walked with him through the garden. wingfold did not speak. he don't think very badly of my poor brother, do you, mr. wingfold,"" said helen meekley. it is a terrible fate, he returned."
7257,8465-246947-0018.flac," had the cure had been a man she liked, she would not perhaps have minded it so much. he will be able to do without me now,"" she said sadly. i never could understand taking to people at first sight. some people are made so, i suppose, helen."
7258,8465-246947-0009.flac," the dwarf exclaimed helen shuddering at the remembrance of what she'd gone through at the cottage. yes, that man's soul is as grand and beautiful and patient as his body is insignificant and distorted and troubled."
7259,8465-246947-0005.flac," i think i never saw a lovely or disposition. i do hope his mind will soon be more composed. i think he knows where alone he can find rest. i am well aware how foolish that of which i speak seems to some minds, miss lingard."
7260,8465-246947-0020.flac, i know that could never have been. you ran to meet me and took me in your arms and kissed me. i was as if i had crossed the sea of death and found paradise in your bosom. i am not likely to forget you for mr. wingfold.
7261,8465-246947-0014.flac," was it rudimentary thankfulness to the father of her spirit? as she stood gazing with the look of a mother over her sick child, he lifted his eyelids and smiled a sad smile. when did you come into the room?"" he said. a minute ago, she answered."
7262,8465-246947-0025.flac, and it was not going to put any horrid notions about duty and self-sacrifice into the poor boy's head. he's coming again tomorrow at a leopold almost gleefully. and then perhaps he will tell me more and help me on a bit. did he tell you he wants to bring a friend with him?
7263,8465-246947-0010.flac," he is the wisest and best man i have ever known. i must ask leopold, returned helen, who the better the man was represented, felt the more jealous and fearful of the advice he might give."
7264,8465-246947-0013.flac," she stepped quickly and around the screen to the side of the bed. there, to her glad surprise, he lay fast asleep with the tears not yet dried upon his face. her heart swelled with some sense unknown before."
7265,8465-246947-0006.flac," but when a man is once overwhelmed in his own deeds, when they have turned into specters to mock at him, when he loathes himself and turns with sickness from past, present, and future, i know but one choice left."
7266,8465-246947-0015.flac," i did not hear you,"" he returned. no, you were asleep. not i. mr. wingfold is only just gone. i have let him out on the meadow, since. leopold stared, looked half alarmed and then said,"
7267,8465-246947-0023.flac," you know all about him though you never saw him before. that is true, return leopold. but then he came to me with his door open and let me walk in."
7268,8465-246947-0012.flac," could it be that wingfult's bearing had communicated to her mind a shadow of the awe, with which she had left the place where perhaps a soul was being born again? leopold did not move. terror laid hold of her heart."
7269,8465-246947-0026.flac," no, i can't see the good of taking more people into our confidence. why should he not do what he thinks best, helen? you don't interfere with the doctor. why should you with him? when a man is going to the bottom as fast as he can."
7270,8465-246947-0003.flac," he was not aware that the tears stood in his eyes, but helen saw them. you know all she faltered. i do. will you let me out by the garden again? i wish to be alone. she led the way down the stair."
7271,8465-246947-0017.flac," that is a good fellow, such a good fellow. a pang of jealousy the first she had ever felt shot to her heart. she had hithorosed since his trouble been all and all to her leopold."
7272,8465-246947-0021.flac," good and kind and strong as he is. even she could not make me forget you, helen. but neither you nor i can do without mr. wingfold anymore, i fancy. i wish you liked him better."
7273,8465-246947-0016.flac," did god make me sleep, helen? she did not answer. the light of a new hope in his eye, as if the dawn had begun at last to break over the dark mountains, was already reflected from her heart. oh helen, he said."
7274,8465-246947-0022.flac," but you will in time. you see, he's not one to pay young ladies compliments, as i have heard some parsons do. and he may be a little, no, not unpolished. not that, that's not what i mean, but unorbitant in his manners."
7275,8465-246947-0000.flac," as wingfold came out of the room, which was near the stair, helen rose from the top of it where she had been sitting all the time he had been in with her brother. he closed the door gently behind him and stepped softly along the landing."
7276,8465-246947-0002.flac," but at his head stood one who watched his throes with the throbs of such a human heart, as never beaten any bosom but his own, and the executioners were angels of light. no wonder if with such a feeling in his breast we fold walked softly and his face glistened."
7277,8465-246947-0001.flac," a human soul and guilt and agony is an awful presence, but there was more than that in the hush of the curate. he felt as if he had left the physician of souls behind him at the bedside."
7278,8465-246947-0008.flac, the terror of his possible counsel for the moment vanished. he could never tell him to give himself up.
7279,8465-246947-0019.flac," i know i took to you at first sight. i shall never forget the first time i saw you when i came to this country a lonely little foreigner. and you, a great beautiful lady, for such you seemed to me, though you have told me since you were only a great gauky girl."
7280,8465-246947-0007.flac," into the life, i hope your brother will enter. i am so glad you don't hate him. hate him. who but a demon could hate him? helen lifted a grateful look from eyes that swam and tears."
7281,8063-274117-0031.flac," i must and will learn who that woman is,"" said the musketeer again, and then, without further deliberation, he set off in pursuit of her. as he was going alone, he tried to think how he could possibly contrive to make her raise her veil. she is not young, he said."
7282,8063-274117-0019.flac," no, no one seems to be following the coffin. yes, said portos, i see a man."
7283,8063-274117-0035.flac," a poor franciscan mendicum friar replied the latter, who had not even a dog to love him in this world, and to accompany him to his last resting place. if that were really the case, though, dartanian,"
7284,8063-274117-0032.flac," and as a woman of high-ranking society, i ought to know that figure and peculiar style of walk. as he ran, the sound of his spurs and of his boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange jingling noise. a fortunate circumstance in itself"
7285,8063-274117-0029.flac," either by way of attack or defense that they must be conversing about any other subject then of love. at the end of the conversation, the lady rose and bowed profoundly to aramis."
7286,8063-274117-0034.flac," he murmured, madame de chavrous, dertanion would not go home until he had learnt everything."
7287,8063-274117-0016.flac," missurus, i plouche, i am one of those good-humored sort of men whom heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days."
7288,8063-274117-0024.flac," leave me. leave me. i feel i'm beginning already to be much comforted by my meditations, so do not interrupt me."
7289,8063-274117-0033.flac," which he was far from reckoning upon. the noise disturbed the lady. she seemed to fancy she was being either followed or pursued, which is indeed the case and turned around."
7290,8063-274117-0022.flac," what said portos to dartanian as he turned round? are you going to remain here? yes, i will join you presently."
7291,8063-274117-0028.flac," yes, he added after a pause."
7292,8063-274117-0025.flac," the two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which they carried the litter, and were letting their burden glide gently into the open grave."
7293,8063-274117-0030.flac," the cavalier kneels at the beginning, the young lady, by and by, gets tame down, and then it is she who has to supplicate, who is this lady? i would give anything to ascertain. it seemed impossible, however, for aramis was the first to leave."
7294,8063-274117-0021.flac," it is exactly my own case. i was so milling collied first that i could do nothing but make the sign of the cross all day and the chance were like so many nails being driven into my head, but now they lull me to sleep."
7295,8063-274117-0015.flac," why, i feel it does me good to contemplate a few dead. upon my words, i'd tell you."
7296,8063-274117-0026.flac," the grave having been filled up, the priests turned away and the grave digger, having addressed a few words to them, followed them as they moved away."
7297,8063-274117-0020.flac, i find it interesting said dartanian leaning on the windowsill.
7298,8063-274117-0023.flac," not yet. ah, yes, the grave digger is waiting until the cords are fastened around the beer. but..."
7299,8063-274117-0017.flac," we're going to have a representation now for i think i heard something like chanting. yes, said dartanian, i hear singing too."
7300,8063-274117-0014.flac," and who have to listen to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day, and to the soulless tramp, tramp, tramp of 150,000 foot passengers. but living, said porto's, living, remember that."
7301,8063-274117-0027.flac," it is aramus himself. aramus, in fact, remained alone on that side at least. for hardly had he turned his head when a woman's footsteps and the wrestling of her dress were heard on the path close to him, he immediately turned around."
7302,8063-274117-0018.flac," the officiating priest, the beetle,"
7303,8063-274117-0011.flac," i assure you that it is very curious. hardly a day passes that someone is not buried there, for fontaine blu is by no means an inconsiderable place. sometimes we see young girls clothed in white carrying banners."
7304,8063-274117-0007.flac, i have had four avenues laid out and at the end of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the others.
7305,8063-274117-0005.flac," took both of his friends by the hand. i am going to show you over the house."" he said."
7306,8063-274117-0002.flac, and his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet.
7307,8063-274117-0008.flac," and he led his two guests to a window. asa d'artagnan, this is the rudileon. yes, i have two windows on this side, a poultry, insignificant view."
7308,8063-274117-0010.flac," it is the horizon, a thick line of green, which is yellow in the spring, green in the summer, red in the autumn and white in the winter."
7309,8063-274117-0013.flac," if i had any, i should be far from rejecting them, said plâche, but possessing only this little cemetery full of flowers, so moss-grown, shady and quiet. i am contented with it, and i think of those who live in town on the brûde de l'embaude, for instance,"
7310,8063-274117-0006.flac," i am a great stickler for a good view myself, said portos."
7311,8063-274117-0004.flac," brisk and lively as ever held out his hand to plushes, and dartanian requested permission to embrace madame trouchein, the latter to show that she bore no ill will, approached portos upon whom she conferred the same favor."
7312,8063-274117-0009.flac," for there was always that bustling and noisy inn which is a very disagreeable neighbor. i had four windows here, but i bricked up two. let us go on said dartinian."
7313,8063-274117-0001.flac," he took by assault portus' room, which was next to his own. the worthy portus was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder, in the dim obscurity of the room, his gigantic frame was pre-ominantly displayed."
7314,8063-274117-0012.flac," and then, too, we see some of the officers of the king's household. i should not like that, said portoas. there's not much amusement in it at all events, said dartanian."
7315,8063-274117-0000.flac, like a kind good housekeeper. it was still perfectly dark then.
7316,8063-274117-0003.flac, the whole household was already up. the cook was mercilessly slaughtering in the poultry yard. celestine was gathering white cherries in the garden. partus.
7317,8063-274116-0021.flac," frankly, conceded, d'artagnan complimented plaint-shay and said, you are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable. life, monsieur, sir plaint-shay laughing, is capital, which a man ought to invest as sensibly as he possibly can."
7318,8063-274116-0012.flac," whether upon a piece of old china, or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness, or upon the weapons hanging against the wall, the soft light was softly reflected, and its rays seem to linger everywhere upon something or another agreeable to the eye. the lamp, which lighted the room,"
7319,8063-274116-0024.flac," you should not call her madame,"" said dartanian. why not, asplansche, because it would make her seem older every time you call her so? well?"
7320,8063-274116-0029.flac," a meal into a regular feast. fresh butter, salt, beef, anchovies, tournée, a shop full of plungees, commodities, fowls, vegetables, salad, fish from the pond and the river, game from the forest, all the produce and fact of the province."
7321,8063-274116-0035.flac, while the two wine bivers
7322,8063-274116-0008.flac, interest in an old stable suit of clothes. depesent.
7323,8063-274116-0032.flac," d'artagnan still preserved his dignity and self-possession, but porthos had lost a portion of his, and the mert soon began to grow somewhat uproarious. d'artagnan..."
7324,8063-274116-0033.flac," recommended, a new descent into the cellar, and, as plansche no longer walked with the steadiness of a well-trained foot soldier,"
7325,8063-274116-0037.flac," dartanian, whom nothing ever escaped, remarked how much red her truce's left cheek was than her right."
7326,8063-274116-0038.flac, and trouchein was looking at him with a most bewitching smile. the sparkling wide of an zhu very soon produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions.
7327,8063-274116-0020.flac," and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in question. not, however,"
7328,8063-274116-0030.flac," the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of dust which covered them. portus's heart began to expand as he said, i am hungry and he sat himself beside medaim trushin, whom he looked at in the most killing manner."
7329,8063-274116-0039.flac," after his friend had undressed him, dortanian got into his own bed saying to himself, more do you."
7330,8063-274116-0036.flac," porto's fancies himself at laoshell thought their tenon as they returned, frayed with bottles."
7331,8063-274116-0016.flac, at the sound of his gigantic voice the cat took flight.
7332,8063-274116-0027.flac, she placed her 2000 flooring in my establishment.
7333,8063-274116-0005.flac," pierfond. i have only one cow planshe hayson to say modestly, and i have thirty said port those. well, rather, i don't exactly know how many i have. when the two cavaliers had entered, planshe fastened the door behind them."
7334,8063-274116-0001.flac, hawthorn and wild hopps formed an impenetrable fence behind which rose a white house with a high-tiled roof.
7335,8063-274116-0034.flac, they set off humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening.
7336,8063-274116-0009.flac," oh, they shall have as much as they like. gently, gently my man said, dartanian, we are getting on a little too fast, a few oats and a good bed. nothing more. some brand and water for my horse said, portos."
7337,8063-274116-0025.flac," and a very pretty name too, sid portos."
7338,8063-274116-0018.flac, monsieur le berrand du valant.
7339,8063-274116-0007.flac," portus, claude hold of some peas, which were twined round poles stuck into the ground in eight, or rather browsed upon them, shells and all."
7340,8063-274116-0022.flac," plansche turned to his housekeeper. you have before you, he said to her?"
7341,8063-274116-0000.flac," the cavaliers looked up and saw that what plansche had announced to them was true. ten minutes afterwards, they were in the street called the rue de leon on the opposite side of the hostelry of the bopéon. a high hedge of bushy elders"
7342,8063-274116-0003.flac," on second thoughts, he took hold of his horse by the bridle and let it about 30 paces further on, his two campaigns following him. he then advanced about another 30 paces until he arrived at the door of a carthouse, lighted by an iron grating, and lifting up a wooden latch pushed open one of the folding doors."
7343,8063-274116-0011.flac," this room, softly lighted by a lamp placed upon a table, seemed from the end of the garden, like a smiling image of repose, comfort and happiness. in every direction where the rays of light fell,"
7344,8063-274116-0040.flac, no one in the house was capable of taking the slightest notice.
7345,8063-274116-0023.flac," and about two others as well said the lady with a very decided flammish accent. madame is dutch and quiet dartanian. portus curled his mustache, the circumstance, which was not lost upon dartanian, who noticed everything. i am from antwerp said the lady."
7346,8063-274116-0013.flac, whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the window frames splendidly illuminated a damask tablecloth as white as snow. the table was laid for two persons. amber colored wine sparkled in a long cut glass bottle
7347,8063-274116-0010.flac," and came out into a little garden behind the house, the principal front of which, as we have already noticed, faced the street. as they approached,"
7348,8063-274116-0004.flac," he entered first leading his horse after him by the bridle into a small courtyard where an odor met them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable. that smells all right,"" said porto's loudly getting off his horse, and i almost began to think"
7349,8063-274116-0006.flac," in the meantime, d'artagnan, who had dismounted with his usual agility, inhaled the fresh-perfumed air with the delight of parisian feels at this site of green feels and fresh foliage,"
7350,8063-274116-0031.flac," do not trouble yourselves, he said, if kushen should leave the table now and then during supper for she will have to look after your bedrooms. in fact, the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently, and they could hear on the first floor above them the creaking of the wooden bedsteads and the rolling of the casters on the floor."
7351,8063-274116-0019.flac, port those bowed with a reverence which ann of austria would have approved of.
7352,8063-274116-0026.flac," she ran away from a brute of a husband who was in the habit of beating her. being myself a peacock born, i was always very fond of the artesian women and it is only a step from artwa and flanders."
7353,8063-274116-0002.flac," between the two, a small door with a porch supported by a couple of pillars formed the entrance to the house. the door was gained by a step raised a little from the ground."
7354,8063-274116-0014.flac," near the table, in a high-backed armchair, reclined fast asleep, a woman of about 30 years of age, her face, the very picture of health and freshness. upon her knees lay a large cat with her paws folded under her,"
7355,8063-274116-0015.flac," and her eyes half closed, purring in that significant manner, which, according to feline habits, indicates perfect contentment."
7356,8063-274116-0017.flac," introduced his due companions into the room where the table was already laid. permit me my dear, he said, to present to you monsieur l'echevalier d'otagnan, my patron."
7357,8063-274116-0028.flac," in which have brought her in 10,000. bravo, plansche! she is free and well off. she has a cow, a maid servant, and old celestine at her orders. she mends my linen, knits my winter stockings. she only sees me every fortnight."
7358,8063-274115-0013.flac," the form and clasp his hands together, the two others got under the counters, fearing porthos, might have a taste for human flesh. we shall only take a sort of a snack here,"" said d'artagnan."
7359,8063-274115-0029.flac," oh, said plencher, muscaton is not dead, and yet monsieur le baron is very fond of him."
7360,8063-274115-0008.flac," he will very soon have none at all to do if this sort of thing continues grumbled the foreman who had planshez's word that he should be a successor. in the midst of his despair,"
7361,8063-274115-0024.flac," and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner than you do now. certainly, i should have said so formally replied the good-natured portos with an embarrassment full of delicacy, but formally..."
7362,8063-274115-0009.flac," he approached portthos, who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from a backshop to the shop itself. he hoped that portthos would rise, and that his movement would distract his devouring ideas. what do you want my man, as portthos affably?"
7363,8063-274115-0007.flac, had already begun to disappear.
7364,8063-274115-0016.flac," my shop is saved, exclaim plashe. yes, as the cheese was whispered the foreman. what cheese? the dutch cheese inside which a rat had made his way, and we found only the rind left."
7365,8063-274115-0017.flac," where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared. alas, thought the grocer addressing a look at dartanian full of entrady, which the latter half understood. as soon as they had finished eating, they set off. it was late."
7366,8063-274115-0005.flac," the shells of which were scattered all over the floor, where they were trampled by everyone who went in and out of the shop, poured those pulled from the stock, with his lips at one mouthful bunches of the rich muscatel raisins, if they're beautiful bloom."
7367,8063-274115-0019.flac," and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows, his woods, and his rabbit warrants. port those had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor. when dartanian saw his two campaigns and earnest conversation,"
7368,8063-274115-0004.flac," where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose detected. the delicious figs from provolce, filberts from the forest, tours, plums were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours, his teeth like millstones cracked heaps of nuts."
7369,8063-274115-0000.flac," would be one of the privileged travelers, and as the plume and porto s hat made the wooden candles suspended over the front, jingle together,"
7370,8063-274115-0003.flac, and into the drawers full of sweet meats.
7371,8063-274115-0035.flac," because, i don't know where it ends, and also because it is full of poachers. how can the poachers make the force so agreeable to you? because they hunt my game, and i hunt them."
7372,8063-274115-0034.flac," nearly as beautiful as my forest at bally, plansche open the eyes very wide."
7373,8063-274115-0032.flac," replied plenche, somewhat humiliated, but a country box. ah ah, i understand, you are modest. no monsieur le belon. i speak the plain truth. i have room for a couple of friends. that's all."
7374,8063-274115-0030.flac," and i was only saying this very morning to d'artagnan how much i regretted him. but tell me planchet. thank you, mr. lebel. thank you. good lad, good lad. how many acres of park have you got? of park?"
7375,8063-274115-0002.flac," received portthos with respect mingled with the tenderest cordiality. portthos, who was a little cold and stiff in his manners at first, on account of the social difference existing at that period between a barren and a grocer, soon began to soften when he perceived so much good feeling."
7376,8063-274115-0031.flac," we're about to miss your at your chateau. oh, miss your lebeau. i have neither chateau nor park nor meadows nor woods. what have you got then in quad portas? and why do you call it a country seat? i did not call it a country seat, miss your lebeau."
7377,8063-274115-0012.flac," yes, but if raisins nuts and almonds are heating, there's no doubt at all of it, missur honey is very cooling, said bortos, stretched out his hand towards a small barrel of honey, which was open, and he plunged the scoop with"
7378,8063-274115-0021.flac," in the beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees, and where he had played under the green apple trees covered with red-cheeked fruit, he went on to say that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune, he would return to nature,"
7379,8063-274115-0001.flac," for the morrow. but the groscher had a heart of gold, ever mindful of the good old times, a trait that carries youth into old age. so, plache, notwithstanding a sort of internal shiver, checked as soon as experienced,"
7380,8063-274115-0036.flac, which in these peaceful times is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war in a small scale.
7381,8063-274115-0018.flac, and then the three riders would left paris about six in the evening arrived at fontainebleu.
7382,8063-274115-0026.flac," if that be the case, my dear plansche, i will do so certainly reply to this."
7383,8063-274115-0033.flac," in the first place, they can walk about the king's forest, which is very beautiful."
7384,8063-274115-0023.flac," what is it in quard porto's looking all around him, as if in search of the circumstance that annoyed plache and desirus of freeing him from it? why? formerly said the grocer, you used to call me plache quite short."
7385,8063-274115-0010.flac," i should like to pass you, missura, if it is not troubling you too much. very well said porthos. it does not trouble me in the least. at the same moment, he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband, lifted him off the ground, and placed him very gently on the other side."
7386,8063-274115-0011.flac," smiling all the while with the same affable expression. as soon as porto said placed him on the ground, the lad's legs so shook under him that he fell back upon some sacks of corks, but noticing the giant's gentleness of manner he ventured again and said,"
7387,8063-274115-0025.flac," so that, monsieur le barron, continue the grocer."
7388,8063-274115-0022.flac, how so? why? you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon.
7389,8063-274115-0020.flac," separated himself from the whole world as he had done from portos and from plache. the moon shone softly through the foliage of the forest, the breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfume to the horse's nostrils and they snorted and pranced along delightedly."
7390,8063-274115-0028.flac," which made the animals legs almost give way. the hertian burst out laughing as he said, take care plansche!"
7391,8063-274115-0006.flac," at each other without venturing to open their lips. they did not know who port those was, for they had never seen them before."
7392,8063-274115-0015.flac, they had never heard that an ogre was ever called monsieur le bell. i will take a few biscuits to eat on the road said porto's carolously and he emptied a whole jar of anacid biscuits into a huge pocket of his doublet.
7393,8063-274115-0014.flac," so much the better you overwhelm me, monsieur le baron. the monsieur le baron had a great effect upon the men who detected a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind. this title too reassured them."
7394,8063-274115-0027.flac," but if fortunate, movement of the horse made him miss his aim,"
7395,8063-274112-0028.flac," when you were there, when we both were there, a certain arab,"
7396,8063-274112-0011.flac," therefore, at fantom blu, for to do so would be useless, but with the permission of our readers, follow him to the rue de l'ambide, where he was located at the sign of the pélaun d'or."
7397,8063-274112-0029.flac," he was a clever fellow, although of a very odd complexion, which was the same color as your olives. well, this arab, whenever he had done eating or working, used to sit down to rest himself."
7398,8063-274112-0003.flac, why? i think you're quite as well dressed as the...
7399,8063-274112-0007.flac, quite exhausted from dancing.
7400,8063-274112-0005.flac," whenever anyone asked him, how do you intend to dress yourself this evening? he replied, i shall undress myself at which the ladies all laughed."
7401,8063-274112-0038.flac, things.
7402,8063-274112-0030.flac," as i am resting myself now and smoked, i cannot tell you what sort of magical leaves in a large amber mouth tube."
7403,8063-274112-0020.flac, but dartanjian did not stir.
7404,8063-274112-0025.flac," of course, monsieur d'artagnan, well, well then, the word distresses me beyond measure. tell me why you were distress plencher, said d'artagnan. if you say that you are not even asleep,"
7405,8063-274112-0035.flac," in point of fact, then, better to sit down then to stand up as plain enough, especially when one may be fitteagueed, and plush a smile in a rogush way. as for better to be lying down, let that pass."
7406,8063-274112-0018.flac," while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed, and the rhythmic steps of a troll of soldiers forming the night watch could be heard retreating. dartunyon continued, however, to think of nothing except the blue corner of the sky. a few paces from him,"
7407,8063-274112-0034.flac," i have no doubt of it, but what do you think of his mode of reasoning?"
7408,8063-274112-0036.flac," it is, in my opinion, very absurd, my own undoubted preference being for my bed. and if you are not of my opinion, it is simply as i have already had the honor of telling you because you were boring yourself to death. plans-chais."
7409,8063-274112-0010.flac," ah, indeed, said the musketeer, continuing his imperceptible tone of irony."
7410,8063-274112-0033.flac," he looked like a basket maker making baskets. you are quite right plansha, he did!"
7411,8063-274112-0040.flac," i'll plushay my friend, return dot ten yarn. you are getting ambitious."
7412,8063-274112-0009.flac," aha, if i could only hold the balancing pole while you were dancing, it would be a very different affair. but my dear monsieur d'autagnon, so the king gravely, people danced without balancing poles."
7413,8063-274112-0037.flac," exactly. well then, i am like his hair. he has got a hair also then. he has all sorts of animals. well, what does his hair do then?"
7414,8063-274112-0023.flac," and yet, plansche fancy that, in token of tacit approval. he saw him imperceptibly smile at the word stupid. this emboldened him to say, are you a sleep misser, d'atenyo? no, plansche, i am not even asleep. reply the musketeer."
7415,8063-274112-0000.flac," and exceedingly unhappy. in fact, dartanian. dartanian, we say, for we must call him by his name to remind our readers of his existence. dartanian, we repeat,"
7416,8063-274112-0004.flac," it was just such a compliment, dartan-yan, would choose when he did not feel disposed to pay any other."
7417,8063-274112-0024.flac," i am in despair, so plushy, to hear such a word as even. well."
7418,8063-274112-0016.flac," there was just enough blue and no more to fill one of the sacks of lentils or aricot, which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor. thus extended at his ease and sheltered in his place of observation behind the window, dartan-yan,"
7419,8063-274112-0013.flac," a perfume of spices mingled with another perfume less exotic, but more penetrating, namely, that which arose from the street, ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer. dautanion reclining in an immense straight back chair, with his legs not stretched out,"
7420,8063-274112-0022.flac," notwithstanding the noise produced by plotche's fall, d'artagnan, who had in the course of his existence heard many other and very different falls, did not appear to pay the least attention to the present one. besides,"
7421,8063-274112-0002.flac," the mosqueter felt that he needed something more than this to satisfy the cravings of his nature. at every moment, assailed by people asking him, how do you think this costume suits me, monsieur d'artagnan? he would reply to them in quiet, sarcastic tones."
7422,8063-274112-0039.flac," and yet, missur, you have a look out upon the street. yes, and wonderfully interesting that is, of course. but it is no less true, missur, that"
7423,8063-274112-0027.flac," in other words, you have no longer your orders to issue or your men to review and maneuver. you need the sound of guns, drums, and all that din of confusion."
7424,8063-274112-0031.flac," better to sit down and to stand up, to lie down and to sit down, to be dead than to lie down. he was an acutely melancholy arab and i remember him perfectly well."
7425,8063-274112-0006.flac," and also to receive an exchange, d'artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of private business. at the moment, d'artagnan made his request,"
7426,8063-274112-0014.flac," but simply placed upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen. both his arms were crossed over his head, his head reclining upon his left shoulder like alexander the great, his eyes."
7427,8063-274112-0001.flac," had absolutely nothing, whatever to do, amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion. after following the king during two whole days at fountain blu,"
7428,8063-274112-0008.flac, anyone who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave him. sire said dartan-yong.
7429,8063-274112-0026.flac," plauché, you know that i am never bored. except today and the day before yesterday. bah! monsieur d'atonion, it is a week since you returned here from fountain blu."
7430,8063-274112-0017.flac," seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier, as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the palace, but was in the contrary a quiet, easygoing citizen in a state of stagnation between his dinner and supper or between his supper and his bed."
7431,8063-274112-0021.flac," after a prolonged reflection on the subject, the most ingenious means that suggested itself to him under the present circumstances was to let himself roll off the sack onto the floor, murmuring at the same time against himself, the word stupid."
7432,8063-274112-0019.flac," and his eyes fixed on dartagnan, who was either thinking, dreaming or sleeping with his eyes open."
7433,8063-274112-0032.flac," he used to cut off the heads of protestants with the most singular gusto. precisely, and then he used to embalm them when they were worth the trouble."
7434,8063-274112-0015.flac," usually, so quick and intelligent in their expression were now half closed, and seemed fastened as it were upon a small corner of blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys."
7435,8063-274112-0012.flac," and the weather was exceedingly warm. there was only one window open, and that one belonging to a room."
7436,5808-54425-0014.flac," no one had ever looked at you until i pick you up, and you've been strutting around ever since."
7437,5808-54425-0008.flac," then he became a hangar on at the clubs, a gentile loafer. he used to say in his sober moments that at the last he was one of the boys that sadness had spoken of. he did not work."
7438,5808-54425-0033.flac," come, come, wake up here. three more jack. what about your father? father."
7439,5808-54425-0011.flac," he went forth at once to celebrate his victory. he did not return to her for three days. then he was battered, unkempt, and thick of speech. she looked at him in silent contempt for a while as he sat nursing his aching head."
7440,5808-54425-0029.flac," oh, a hair of the dog! some men shave their dogs clean, and then have hydrophobia. here jack! they drank, and then, as if the whiskey had done him good, joe sat up in his chair."
7441,5808-54425-0048.flac," he took another step towards her. you put me out tonight,"" he repeated, like a dog. his step was steady, and his tone was clear, menacingly clear. she shrank back from him."
7442,5808-54425-0050.flac," still, he crept slowly toward her, his lips working and his hands moving convulsively. joe, joe, she said, horsley, what's the matter?"
7443,5808-54425-0037.flac," at its close he relapsed into stupidity, murmuring, she throed me down. well, sneered sadness. you see, drunken men tell the truth, and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend."
7444,5808-54425-0019.flac, alternately weeping aloud and quivering with drunken hikoffin sobs.
7445,5808-54425-0017.flac," he pleaded, stretching out his hands to her. her eyes blazed back at him, but she sang on, insolently, tauntingly. the very inanity of the man disgusted her."
7446,5808-54425-0041.flac," this he goped down and followed with another, and another. for a while he stood still, brooding silently, his red eyes blinking at the light. then he turned abruptly and left to the club."
7447,5808-54425-0038.flac," you're disappointed, aren't you? i confess i am disappointed."
7448,5808-54425-0027.flac," and he was about entering upon a discussion to prove that sadness had no soul. when joe, with blood-shot eyes and dishevelled clothes, staggered in and reeled towards them. drunk again!"
7449,5808-54425-0006.flac," she had sought to check his course. her threat of the severance of their relations had held him up for a little time, and she began to believe that he was safe again. he went back to the work he had neglected. drink moderately."
7450,5808-54425-0054.flac, she gazed at him fascinated. she tried to scream and she could not. this was not joe. this was not the boy that she had turned and twisted about her little finger.
7451,5808-54425-0044.flac," his voice was steadier now, but grim. what do you want?"
7452,5808-54425-0031.flac," then, bracing himself up again, he broke out suddenly."
7453,5808-54425-0001.flac," and out of his soul of faith grow a spirit of unbelief. the independence of respectability may harden into the insolence of defiance, and the sensitive cheek of modesty into the brazen face of shamelessness."
7454,5808-54425-0003.flac," it had taken barely five years to accomplish an entire metamorphosis of their characters. in joe's case, even a shorter time was needed. he was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him, and once started."
7455,5808-54425-0025.flac," scags they looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor. it made him think of maldi. he sighed and turned away. i tell you, sadness, he said impulsively. dance in as the poetry of motion."
7456,5808-54425-0000.flac," five years is but a short time in the life of a man, and yet many things may happen therein. for instance, the whole way of a family's life may be changed. good natures may be made into bad ones."
7457,5808-54425-0012.flac," she said finally, with cutting scorn, you ought to be put under a glass case and placed on exhibition. he groaned, and his head sunk lower. a drunken man is always disarmed."
7458,5808-54425-0036.flac," and if this story is one, i'm a made man. the drink seemed to revive the young man again."
7459,5808-54425-0042.flac," it was very late when he reached hattie's door, but he opened it with his latch key, as he had been used to do. he stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy, as he had so often done before."
7460,5808-54425-0010.flac," finally, he took a turn for the better that endured so long that hattie sterling again gave him her faith. then the woman made her mistake. she warmed to him. she showed him that she was proud of him."
7461,5808-54425-0022.flac," and he half-walked, half-filled down the street. sadness and scagsy were together at the club that night. five years had not changed the latter as to wealth or position or inclination."
7462,5808-54425-0005.flac," hattie sterling had given him both his greatest impulse for evil and for good. she had at first given him his gentle push. but when she saw that his collapse would lose her a faithful and useful slave,"
7463,5808-54425-0051.flac, the gallon had fallen away from her breast and showed the convulsive fluttering of her heart.
7464,5808-54425-0030.flac," lucky dog, you might have known it would have happened sooner or later, better sooner than never. skags smoked in silence and looked at joe."
7465,5808-54425-0015.flac," and now this is the way you pay me back. drunk half the time and half drunk the rest. well, you know what i told you the last time you got loaded. i mean it too. you're not the only star in sight. see? she left, mainly."
7466,5808-54425-0035.flac," yes, he does. it drunken man tells the truth. in some cases, said sadness. oh, let me alone, man."
7467,5808-54425-0058.flac," finally, he flung her from him like a rag and sunk into a chair."
7468,5808-54425-0045.flac," get out, while i'll have you take it out. she sprang up in bed, glaring angrily at him. his hands twitched nervously, as if her will were conquering him, and he were uneasy."
7469,5808-54425-0032.flac," he never stole that money. no, he didn't. he threatened to fall asleep now, but the reporter was all alert. he sent it a story. by joe, he exclaimed. did you hear that?"
7470,5808-54425-0028.flac," said sadness. really? it's a waste of time for joe to sober up. hello there."" as the young man brought up against him, take a seat. he put him in a chair at the table."
7471,5808-54425-0020.flac," you shout lay around my house."" he had already begun to fall into a drunken sleep, but she took him, got him to his feet, and pushed him outside the door. now go, you drunken dog."
7472,5808-54425-0007.flac," and acted in most things as a sound sensible being. then, all of a sudden, he went down again, and went down badly. she kept her promise and threw him over."
7473,5808-54425-0026.flac," yes, replied sadness, and dancing in ragtime is the dialect poetry. the reporter did not like this. it savored a flippancy."
7474,5808-54425-0016.flac," and began to sing. you'll have to find another baby now."" for the first time he looked up, and his eyes were full of tears. tears both of grief and intoxication. there was an expression of a whipped dog on his face."
7475,5808-54425-0021.flac," and never put your foot inside this house again."" he stood outside, swaying dizzily upon his feet, and looking back with dazed eyes at the door. then he muttered, put me out, will you? put me out, damn you! well."
7476,5808-54425-0057.flac," she struggled, they held her. her eyes prayed to his, but his were the fire of hell. she fell back upon her pillow and silence. he had not uttered a word. he held her."
7477,5808-54425-0009.flac," but he soon tired of being separated from hattie and straightened up again. after some demur, she received him upon his former footing. it was only for a few months. he fell again. for almost four years, this had happened intermittently."
7478,5808-54425-0024.flac," he mourned truly for his lost companion, and tonight he was in a particularly pensive mood. someone was playing ragtime on the piano, and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music."
7479,5808-54425-0004.flac," there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths. for his will was as flabby as his conscience, and his pride, which stands to some men for conscience, had no definite aim or direction."
7480,5808-54425-0052.flac," and his hands sought each other while the fingers twitched over one another like coiling serpents. you put me out, you, you, and you made me what i am."
7481,5808-54425-0018.flac," and on a sudden impulse she sprang up and struck him full in the face with the flat of her hand. he was too weak to resist the blow, and, tumbling from the chair fell limply to the floor, where he lay at her feet."
7482,5808-54425-0039.flac," oh, you have! well, don't handle it carelessly, it might go off. and sadness arose. the reporter sat thinking for a time, and then followed him, leaving joe in a drunken sleep at the table."
7483,5808-54425-0049.flac," back to the wall, still his hands twitched."
7484,5808-54425-0002.flac, it may be true that the habits of years are hard to change. but this is not true of the first sixteen or seventeen years of a young person's life. elskitti hamilton and joe could not so easily have become what they were.
7485,5808-54425-0023.flac," and he was still a frequent visitor at the banner. he always came in alone now, from adi had gone the way of all the half-world, and reached depths to which mr. skaggs' job prevented him from following her. however,"
7486,5808-54425-0034.flac," here, here, tell us about your father and the money, if he didn't steal it, who did? who did? that's it, who did? oh man, didn't steal it, no he didn't. oh let him alone, scagsy."
7487,5808-54425-0046.flac," he said, yes, and i'm going to do it again."
7488,5808-54425-0047.flac," she started to rise, but he took a step towards her and she paused. he looked as she had never seen him look before. his face was ashen and his eyes like fire and blood. she quailed beneath the look."
7489,5808-54425-0040.flac," there he lay for more than two hours. when he finally awoke, he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep. a part of the hopelessness of his intoxication had gone, but his first act was to call for more whiskey."
7490,5808-54425-0056.flac," for an instant she lost to their steady glare, and then she found her voice. the scream was checked as it began. his fingers had closed over her throat, just where the gown had left its temptingly bear. they gave it to the caress of death."
7491,5808-54425-0055.flac," this was a terrible, terrible man, or a monster."
7492,5808-54425-0053.flac," the realization of what he was, of his valeness and degradation seemed just to have come to him fully. you made me what i am, and then you sent me away. you let me come back, and now you put me out."""
7493,5808-54425-0013.flac," his helplessness, instead of inspiring her with pity, inflamed her with an unfailing anger that burst forth in a volume of taunts."
7494,5808-54425-0043.flac, then he went directly to her room.
7495,5808-48608-0000.flac," when it was the three hundred and forty-seventh night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that ibrahim, son of almati, continued. now when the house-mester heard my name, he sprang to his feet and said,"
7496,5808-48608-0031.flac," and ceased saying her permitted say. when it was the 349th night, she said, it hath reached me o auspicious king."
7497,5808-48608-0002.flac, and karu's with me this night.
7498,5808-48608-0056.flac," woe to thee, sakrabhuha-san alziyadi. i awoke a second time, but no in the knot i went to sleep again, and he came to me a third time, and still i knew the knot and went to sleep again. then he came to me once more and said, out on thee!"
7499,5808-48608-0035.flac," see ye if it be pierced. if so, it be longeth to someone of the folk. if not, tis a provision of allah for us. so they examined it and found it unpearsed."
7500,5808-48608-0036.flac," now, when it was the marrow, the jew carried it to one of his brethren, which was an expert in jewels, and the man asked, oh, such and one, when's hadest thou this pearl?"
7501,5808-48608-0032.flac," that the man took the trencher and jar to the bazaar, but none would buy them of him. however, they're presently passed by a man with a fish, which was so stinking and so swollen,"
7502,5808-48608-0038.flac," it is worth seventy thousand dirums and no more. then he paid him that sum and the jew hired two porters to carry the money to his house. as he came to his door, a beggar accosted him, saying,"
7503,5808-48608-0030.flac," so he took them to the bazaar, but none would buy them of him. however, presently, as he stood in the market, they passed by a man with a fish. and shah-razad perceived the dawn of day."

7545,5808-48608-0040.flac," the baker and other tradesmen donned an importune to me, and my misery became extreme, for i knew of no resource nor what to do. things being on this wise there came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me,"

7553,5808-48608-0014.flac," therefore, all the people abstained from alms' deed and none could give anything to anyone. now it chanced that one day a beggar accosted a certain woman, and indeed hunger was sore upon him, and said to her,"
7554,5808-48608-0022.flac," having just given birth to the boy. so he wrote to his mother, bidding her carry the woman into the desert and leave her there. the old queen obeyed his commandment, and abandoned the woman and her son in the desert."

7556,1116-137572-0005.flac," is the object of one's wishes as desirable as one had expected? because reality rarely measures up to imagination, the first answer is almost bound to be, no, this is not what i expected. and the first emotion tends to be disappointment."
7557,1116-137572-0055.flac," hoping to keep their marriage unchanged in its first stage of promise. if both husband and wife accept maturing responsibilities as they come, their marriage relationship will keep pace with their own development and will therefore become increasingly satisfying to them."
7558,1116-137572-0015.flac," compromise will lift these essentially petty decisions of precedence above the level of selfishness. decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both, not the selfish or narrow wish of either."

7566,1116-137572-0037.flac," or by going out without his wife, or by having his friends in when she is not around. 5. the general level of emotion is what counts, not the spectacular scaling of peaks. staking all on high moments is melodrama with no comic relief."
7567,1116-137572-0006.flac," regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations, and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than, although different from what the imagination pictured. knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to one's own marriage, but likely to occur in all,"
7568,1116-137572-0024.flac," compromise, not submission, should be the rule. if john forges a head on one count, mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front. three."

7570,1116-137572-0019.flac," regardless of its effect on the mate, it is shortsighted in the extreme. even if you could care only for personal pleasure, that cannot long outlast your spouse's displeasure. saging a contest, or a succession of small contests, for the sake of finding out who is boss,"
7571,1116-137572-0042.flac," you remember other people you once thought you loved and wonder panicked stricken? how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did. this is probably an almost universal experience, marking not the beginning of the end of love."

7577,1116-137572-0021.flac," it is an empty honor, for the one who bends, but does not break, will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one. because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving into the man, this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears."

7580,1116-137572-0040.flac," another terrible moment that is due to calm may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping. soon or late, you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you. it may be a slight uncouthness at table,"
7581,1116-137572-0010.flac," like everything else that is alive, it must be kept growing through exercise, or it wastes away. love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving, but it does not give the direction. that comes from understanding and cooperation."
7582,1116-137572-0052.flac," if the expression of anger is to have its proper, stimulative effect, it has to be administered but rarely and then in small doses. more has a paralyzing effect on the recipient."
7583,1116-137572-0022.flac," no man can afford to be crippled for life by letting his wife swaddle him with solicitude as some other spoiler children for their own glorification. a woman's feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that, aside from her momentary pleasure,"
7584,1116-137572-0041.flac, now it vexes you. end your vexation terrifies you. does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did? you cannot help your change of feeling. how then can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane?
7585,1116-137572-0048.flac, but instead a complete trust in each other. one who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage. crybabying is no more helpful in marriage than in business or social life.
7586,1116-137572-0050.flac," the marriage partner, who is mature, will maintain trust in the other's good intentions and the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings. a chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness. why doesn't his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism so he can correct it?"
7587,1116-137572-0026.flac," a chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment, but a human being's more lasting change is not so readily made. each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her."
7588,1116-137572-0034.flac," common friends are fine, but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate."

7590,1116-137572-0047.flac," but without the larger adjustment, the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form. in the sex life and marriage as another part of the association, each partner wins by considering the other before the self."
7591,1116-137572-0032.flac," this is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close-grown love of husband and wife, a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated. other responsibilities, other interests, may serve a similar purpose."
7592,1116-137572-0016.flac, the choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made. human judgment being as faulty as it is.
7593,1116-137572-0033.flac," the more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep. friends olden new have a function in relieving the over-close concern of one marriage partner with the other. they are to play their full part in preventing over-concentration,"
7594,1116-137572-0054.flac," as this is an impossibility, they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction. that does not mean they are unadapted to each other. they are afraid to leave the known pleasures of their first youth for the unguessed satisfaction of maturity. so they try to stand still."
7595,1116-137572-0035.flac, the factor that underlies all the perplexities and most of the contentment of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy. here the supreme testing always comes. each means so much to the other.
7596,1116-137572-0009.flac," love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction, and love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathways to marriage success. but love is not a finished product that, once it comes, can forever after be trusted to keep its strength."
7597,1116-137572-0002.flac," unless they are very different from most people, this new joint enterprise is going to mean more to each of them than anything else ever can. before them is a clear road, not to happiness as they may believe, but to the opportunity for gaining happiness."
7598,1116-137572-0029.flac," using the mate for relief as a nagging, whining, crying, or grumbling is taboo. if you are tired or irritable, you can rest or exercise for restoration, as in the days before marriage."
7599,1116-137572-0053.flac, producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation. 9. willing this to grow is the most necessary factor for success. marriage is a life program of going on together that requires maturity.
7600,1116-137572-0004.flac, but the first days of marriage bring out a difference set of feelings. those that come when one has definitely obtained a position of anything that before was only promised. at first the emotion seemed to stand still. this is the long coveted moment. then one begins to appraise.
7601,1116-137572-0018.flac," if each one is hurt at the other's inability to join instantly in his or her plans, they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair. trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want,"
7602,1116-137572-0049.flac," in the healthy marriage, the sympathetic response will soon give way to anger, which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one, helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult. in the unhealthy marriage, sympathy will grow into pity."
7603,1116-137572-0012.flac," in order to cope with their problems, they must realize first that they cannot stumble upon married happiness, that they must possess and cultivate a positive will to succeed."
7604,1116-137572-0028.flac," knowing themselves accepted, they lounge mentally, mannerly, and physically, when at home or elsewhere alone together. some of this relaxation is a good thing, but it is a mistake to let home and spouse to generate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy."
7605,1116-137572-0038.flac," some husbands, some wives, are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings, but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare-ups. others cannot utter a poetic phrase."
7606,1116-137572-0031.flac," even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life. to care only for each other is selfishness for two, only one step removed from self-centered engrossment."
7607,1116-137572-0027.flac," therefore, you have to respect yourself and act as if you did, even at home. too many couples exploit the sense of letdown that marriage brings with it. after so long a time, husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters."
7608,1116-137572-0039.flac," make a romantic gesture or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it. this difference is one of makeup and training, not of marriage capacity. the couple who are sure of each other's steady affection, regardless of its expression and romantic interludes,"
7609,1116-137572-0044.flac," always it is the unturned page that holds the answer to the question, how goes it with this marriage? the present is useful only as a foundation stone for the future, which is being built up out of many fleeting present moments, each quickly lost in the past."
7610,1116-137572-0003.flac," when one has received the promise of something greatly desired, but must wait a while before it's delivery. the happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit, and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight."
7611,1116-137572-0013.flac," here are nine guideposts to help john and mary along their road. one, the first requirement is the building of a union that is just to both. the smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires."
7612,1116-132851-0026.flac," so one day the brownie asks shego if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance there. of course, shego was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie, and he ordered barbake to spread her best tablecloths in the barn,"
7613,1116-132851-0018.flac, she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them.
7614,1116-132851-0012.flac," indeed, barbay could only to express a wish for it to be satisfied. if the wind was cold or the sun was hot, and she was afraid to go out less to her complexion should be spoiled, she needed only to run down to the spring close by and say softly, i should like my churns to be full."
7615,1116-132851-0010.flac," the racks filled with hay, the cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row."
7616,1116-132851-0006.flac," at first under different animal shapes. since that time, partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to transform ourselves. and it was in this way that i got to know you. how exclaimed jago filled with astonishment?"
7617,1116-132851-0016.flac," and that this time the girl did not turn rudely away, but listened patiently to the end."
7618,1116-132851-0011.flac," and when she met him outside the door, she stopped and thanked him for his help. to be sure, jago only replied roughly that he didn't know what she was talking about. but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else."
7619,1116-132851-0019.flac, barbaque was furious.
7620,1116-132851-0008.flac," jago declared that nothing could be easier and then taking off his hat, he thanked the dwarf heartily and let his horses back to the farm. next morning was a holiday, and barbic was awake earlier than usual."
7621,1116-132851-0021.flac," while now i can receive no presents except for my husband, i can never dance except with my husband. oh, you wretched dwarf, i will never, never forgive you."" in spite of her fierce words, no one knew better than barbika to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her."
7622,1116-132851-0017.flac, and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time just like a young lady. and they asked for the rest of the day.
7623,1116-132851-0024.flac, but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people that they all laughed as they looked at her horse. at length she caught some words uttered by one man to another. why the farmer's wife has sold her horse's tail and turned in her saddle.
7624,1116-132851-0013.flac," and my wet linen to be stretched on the head to dry, and she'd never give another thought to the matter. if she found the rye bread too hard to bake or the oven taking too long to heat, she just murmured, i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box."
7625,1116-132851-0002.flac, one evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink. he was tired with the long day's work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals waiting till they had done and thinking all the while of barbique.
7626,1116-132851-0007.flac, but how are you going to do it exclaims jago wonderingly? that is my affair. perhaps i may tell you later. meanwhile you just didn't sleep and don't worry yourself about anything.
7627,1116-132851-0000.flac," and choose with silver buckles, the women were all filled with envy. but little cared barbieke, what they might whisper behind her back, as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else's, and that she had more partners than any other girl."
7628,1116-132851-0025.flac, but it was of no use. he declined to move out of a walk.
7629,1116-132851-0022.flac," and after receiving an invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there. to her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the city of the dwarves and to tell them exactly what she wanted."
7630,1116-132851-0023.flac," she had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held. at first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing."
7631,1116-132851-0027.flac," when all was ready, the dwarves and new green suits came bustling in very happy and merry and took their seats at the table. but in a moment they all spring up with a cry and ran away screaming for barbacad placed pans of hot coals under their feet and all their poor little toes were burnt."
7632,1116-132851-0014.flac," why am i not already back from morley with my milk pot empty, my butter bowl inside it, a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate, and the money i have gained in my apron pocket? and in the morning when she got up, lo and behold,"
7633,1116-132851-0001.flac, and what was worse often made fun of him with the rest.
7634,1116-132851-0009.flac," as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off. she went first to the cowhouse, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down."
7635,1116-132851-0028.flac," you won't forget that in a hurry, she said smiling grimly to herself, but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water which they poured on the fire. then they joined hands and danced around at singing. wicked traitorous!"
7636,1116-132851-0003.flac, when a voice came out of the gorge close by.
7637,1116-132851-0004.flac," it is i, the brownie of the lake, reply the voice. but where are you, inquire jeku? look close and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog. i can take, he added proudly, any shape i choose."
7638,1116-132851-0005.flac," and even which is much harder, be invisible if i want to. then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear or reply, jago. certainly, if you wish, and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green."
7639,1116-132851-0020.flac," her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect the life of ease and pleasure. but when she looked at jeygu and beheld his red face, squinting eyes and untidy hair, her anger was doubled."
7640,1116-132851-0015.flac," and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron. and she believed that all this was owing to jago, and she could no longer do without him, even in her thoughts. when things had reached this past, the brownie told the young man that he had better asked barbake to marry him,"
7641,1116-132847-0032.flac," and it is owing to her that i am here. but what are you doing in this nest? i am sitting on six eggs of stone, and i shall not be set free till they are hatched."
7642,1116-132847-0016.flac," the pink and white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace, while her long black hair was intertwined with strings of coral, and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea. at the sight of her, who aren't stopped, dazzled by her beauty."
7643,1116-132847-0021.flac," when it was full, she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot."
7644,1116-132847-0020.flac," the young man gazed at her in surprise. could anyone so rich and so beautiful really wish to be his wife? he looked at her again, and bella was forgotten, as he answered. a man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer. i can only accept it with joy."
7645,1116-132847-0023.flac," jump, she replied, but soon the noise grew louder and like cries. what is it, ask warne, beginning to feel uncomfortable? just the crickets on the heart said she, and broke into a song which drowned the cries from the pot."
7646,1116-132847-0012.flac, and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner. but he only laughed.
7647,1116-132847-0025.flac," and four men stood before him. who are and save us we entreat you and save yourself too, murmur they not daring to raise their voices?"
7648,1116-132847-0017.flac, my name is suar and he answered.
7649,1116-132847-0038.flac," and, turning rapidly, flung it over the witch's head, becoming body what you are in soul, cried she, and in an instant the lovely fairy of the sea was atowed, horrible to look upon. she struggled hard to tear the net as thunder, but it was no use."
7650,1116-132847-0004.flac," the girl was very unhappy as she listened to this, and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things. she implored who are not to leave her, but he would listen to nothing. the birds, he said, continue flying until they reach a field of corn."
7651,1116-132847-0036.flac," very soon, she let her visitor into the great hall where wine and fruit were always waiting, and on the table lay the magic knife left there by hoharn."
7652,1116-132847-0028.flac," little staff of apple tree, over the earth and over the sea, up in the air beguide to me, everywhere to wander free. and immediately this stick became a smart little horse, with the rosette at each ear and a feather on his forehead. he stood quite still."
7653,1116-132847-0033.flac," when you have found her, you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist, and shut her up in it forever. but where might to find a young man's clothes ask she? i will show you, he replied."
7654,1116-132847-0001.flac, and soon they might have been heard be wailing to each other the hardness of their lots.
7655,1116-132847-0015.flac," as soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise, he prepared to jump into the lake and swim to shore. but the bird had guessed his intentions, and plunged beneath the water."
7656,1116-132847-0022.flac," but it did not sound the least like that to huan. there it is again, he said after a short pause."
7657,1116-132847-0034.flac, and the fourth and iron. without waiting for orders they sat down in the nest and crossing their legs comfortably began to prepare the suit of clothes for bella. with one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat.
7658,1116-132847-0024.flac," but though warren held his peace, he was not as happy as before. something seemed to have gone wrong, and then he suddenly remembered bella. is it possible i can't have forgotten her so soon?"
7659,1116-132847-0040.flac," in a car drawn by six cock-shafers, which once had been the six-stone eggs. here i am, he exclaimed, you have broken the spell that held me, and now come and get your reward. and as mounting from his chariot, he led them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels."
7660,1116-132847-0039.flac," her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her. his little paws crossed over his little heart. bella felt as if fingers were tightening around her throat, but she managed to cry, ""'is this you, my hawarn? is this you?' it his eye croaked the little frog."
7661,1116-132847-0014.flac," the island was large and lying almost across it was a lake with a narrow opening to the sea. warren paid the boatman and sent him away, and then proceeded to walk around the lake."
7662,1116-132847-0018.flac," and she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls, while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds."
7663,1116-132847-0030.flac," and gallop like a straw carried along by a tempest, till they reached the foot of a rock called the leap of the deer."
7664,1116-132847-0029.flac," the swallow is less swift than the wind. the wind is less swift than the lightning. but you, my horse, if you love me, must be swifter than them all. but there is the part of my heart that suffers, the best part of my heart that is in danger. and the horse heard her."
7665,1116-132847-0003.flac," that is quite clear replied who were in turning away to his work. whenever they met they repeated their grievances, and at length who weren't patients was exhausted, and one morning he came to bella and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune."
7666,1116-132847-0031.flac," to save you repeated bella, but who are you my little friend?"
7667,1116-132847-0000.flac," and a girl called bella postic. they were cousins and as their mothers were great friends, and constantly in and out of each other's houses, they had often been laid in the same cradle and had played and fought over their games. when they are grown up, they will marry, said the mothers."
7668,1116-132847-0019.flac," came from ship-brecked vessels, and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water. i do not wonder, exclaimed huarun, who now felt quite at home. i do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you. the rich are always envied."
7669,1116-132847-0006.flac," well, go then since you must, but first i will divide with you all that my parents left me. and going to her room, she opened a small chest and took from it a bell, a knife, and a little stick. this bell she said can be heard at any distance, however far,"
7670,1116-132847-0026.flac," and no sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes, as she had done to all our four runners, who were in the fish pond still, where you will shortly join them."
7671,1116-132847-0037.flac," and to the pond which contained the fish, their sides shining with a thousand different colors."
7672,1116-132847-0010.flac," and he walked on to ponte-ven, a pretty little town built on the bank of irriver. he was sitting on a bench outside an inn,"
7673,1116-132847-0027.flac," it was at this very moment that bella, who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy, heard the fairy bell tingle violently. at the sound she grew pale, for she knew it meant that warren was in danger."
7674,1116-132847-0007.flac," but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger. the knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them, while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go. i will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards."
7675,1116-132847-0013.flac," but the men did not know how this was to be done, and shaking their heads over his obstinacy left him to his fate."
7676,1116-132847-0008.flac," and the bell to tell me of your perils, the stick i shall keep for myself so that i can fly to you if ever you have need of me."" then they cried for a little on each other's necks and who weren't started for the mountains. but in those days, as in these beggars abounded,"
7677,1116-132847-0035.flac," and with it in her hand, she stepped into the blue boat which conducted her to the palace of shells. the grouch seemed overjoyed to see her and told her that never before had she be held such a handsome young man."
7678,1116-132847-0005.flac," like them i shall seek to like it what i want. that is money to buy a cow and a pig to fatton. and if you love me, bella, you won't attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage. the girl saw it was useless to say more, so she answered sadly."
7679,1116-132847-0002.flac," i would rent a bit of ground from the master, and then we could be married. yes, sensor bella, with a deep sigh, but we live in such hard times, and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again. we shall have long to wait."
7680,1116-132847-0011.flac, and the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake.
7681,1116-132847-0009.flac," and through every village he passed, they followed who were in crowds, mistaking him for a gentleman because there were no holes in his clothes. there was no fortune to be made here he thought to himself. it is a place for spending and not earning. i see i must go further."
7682,289-121665-0038.flac," why, she exclaimed, smiling again, i can sew them on, of course. then she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran over hill and day-low, and tried what she could, as a shepherd is should, to tack to each sheep its tail-o."
7683,289-121665-0007.flac," good morning, little boat-paper! and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon a short stick. she was bent nearly double by weight of many years. her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals."
7684,289-121665-0004.flac," fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash, and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair. all the shepherds and shepherdises upon the hills, both young and old, soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed."
7685,289-121665-0044.flac," and if you have been observing, you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them, and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found."
7686,289-121665-0006.flac," lang aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons, devoted her time to sowing and mending stockings for her aged mother. one day, while thus occupied,"
7687,289-121665-0039.flac," but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sell in the tail and ran away from her, and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged. she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met"
7688,289-121665-0040.flac," came hobbling to her side and asked, what are you doing with my cat tails? your cat tails replied, bo peep and surprise. what do you mean? why these tails are all cut from white pussy cats, and i put them on the tree to dry."
7689,289-121665-0035.flac," and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious. but there is an end to all troubles, no matter how severe they may seem to be. and it happened one day, as bobiip did stray, onto a meadow hard by."
7690,289-121665-0003.flac," decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself. she was a little might of a child, with flowing that brown locks, and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths. she wore light grey frock,"
7691,289-121665-0014.flac," the old woman chuckled softly, as if the answer amused her and replied, no one knows all about anything, my dear. but i know all about my sheep, protested little boatpeap. do you indeed?"
7692,289-121665-0026.flac," gazed below her. quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her tront flock, looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle chepherdess. bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them."
7693,289-121665-0041.flac," what are you doing with them? i thought they belonged to my sheep, answer bow peeps, sarfly."
7694,289-121665-0015.flac," then you are wiser than most people. and if you know all about them, and you also know they will come home of their own accord. and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual."
7695,289-121665-0043.flac," no one in this world knows all about anything. sheep do not have long tails. there is only a little stump to answer for a tail. neither do rabbits have tails, nor bears, nor many other animals."
7696,289-121665-0030.flac," so you have found your sheep, deary,"" she said in her cracked voice. yes, replied little bo peep, with difficulty repressing a sob. but look, mother, they've all left their tails behind them. why so they have, exclaimed the old woman?"
7697,289-121665-0031.flac," and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her. what do you suppose has become of their tails as the girl? oh, someone has proudly cut them off. they make nice tippets in wintertime, you know."
7698,289-121665-0037.flac," and after pondering the matter for a time, she became discouraged, and, thinking she was no better off than before the tales were found, she began to weep and to be wail her misfortune. but amidst her tears, she bethought herself of her needle and thread."
7699,289-121665-0023.flac," but as it was now time for luncheon, she opened her little basket and eight of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her. after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring nearby,"
7700,289-121665-0022.flac," little bow peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleeding, but when she awoke she found it a joke, for still they were a fleeting. the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill."
7701,289-121665-0000.flac," and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means. they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills, and each morning the mother took her crook and"
7702,289-121665-0046.flac," and now, little bow peep, no more did weep. my tail of tails ends here."
7703,289-121665-0002.flac," upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the use and lambs, so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient chepherdess. so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage, little bo peep, as she was called,"
7704,289-121665-0013.flac," oh, yes, they know me, everyone. and do not you know the sheep? i can call everyone by name,"" said bo peep, confidently, for though i am so young as shepherds, i am fond of my sheep, and know all about them."
7705,289-121665-0024.flac," she decided she would not wait any longer. so up she took her little crook, determined for to find them, and began climbing the hill. when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about."
7706,289-121665-0011.flac," but where is your crook?"" on the grass beside me. and where are your sheep?"" bo peep looked up and could not see them. they must have strayed over the top of the hill, she said, and i will go and seek them."
7707,289-121665-0025.flac," only a green valley and another hill beyond. now really alarmed for the safety of her charge, bopey parried into the valley and up the farther hillside. panting and tired, she reached the summit and, pausing breathlessly."
7708,289-121665-0045.flac," so now little one, run away home, and try to be more thoughtful in the future. your sheep will never miss the tails."
7709,289-121665-0019.flac," said the old woman, i'm going over the hilltop myself and i will send the sheep back to you. so she got upon her feet and began climbing the hill and the girl heard her saying as she walked away. little bobiep has lost her sheep."
7710,289-121665-0029.flac," but after a while, the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lamkins. so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes, and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her."
7711,289-121665-0012.flac," do not be in a hurry, croaked the old woman. they will return presently without your troubling to find them. do you think so, aspo peep? of course. do not the sheep know you?"
7712,289-121665-0009.flac," good morning, mother. can i do anything for you? no, dearie, return the woman in a cracked voice, but i will sit by your side and rest for time. the girl made room on the mound beside her."
7713,289-121665-0017.flac," perhaps you have never noticed their tales at all. no, answer the boatpeap thoughtfully. i don't know that i ever have. the woman laughed so hard at this reply."
7714,289-121665-0018.flac," that she began to cough, and this made the girl remember that her flock had strayed away. i really must go and find my sheep,"" she said, rising to her feet, and then i shall be sure to notice their tails and see if they wag them. sit still, my child."
7715,289-121665-0016.flac," oh, said little boat-peepin' surprise. do they wag their tails? i never noticed that. indeed, exclaimed the old one. then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep."
7716,289-121665-0005.flac," and there were many willing hands to aid her if, which was not often, she needed their assistance. bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage, and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon the mound and,"
7717,289-121665-0032.flac," and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley. bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep, and so, driving them before her, she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost hails."
7718,289-121665-0034.flac," and bo-pep had fully decided to seek for the tales and find them before she related the story of their loss to anyone. each day, for many days after that, little bo-pep wandered about the hills seeking the tales of her sheep,"
7719,289-121665-0010.flac," and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy finger so up the seams of the new frock she was making. buying by the woman asked, why do you come out here to sew? because i am a shepherdess replied the girl."
7720,289-121665-0021.flac," very soon i shall see the sheep coming back, but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance. soon the head of the little shepherds began to nod."
7721,289-121665-0042.flac," i must hunt until i find those that belong to my sheep. my dear said the old woman, i have been deceiving you. you said you knew all about your sheep, and i wanted to teach you a lesson. for however wise we may be."

7723,289-121665-0033.flac," but soon the son began to sink over the hilltops, and she knew she must take her sheep home before night overtook them. she did not tell her mother of her misfortune, for she feared the old shepherds would scold her."
7724,289-121665-0001.flac," and started out with her sheep, that they might feed upon the tender, juicy grasses with which the hills abounded. the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side"
7725,289-121665-0028.flac," nothing was left to eat sheep, but a wee little stump where a tail should be, and little bow peep was so heartbroken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly."
7726,289-121665-0020.flac," and doesn't know where to find them, but leave them alone and they'll come home, all wagging their tails behind them. little bo peep sat still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hillside and disappear over the top. by and by she thought,"
7727,289-121665-0008.flac," deep wrinkles seemed her face in hands, while her nose and chin were so pointed that they nearly met. she was not pleasant to look upon, but bo peep had learned to be polite to the aged, so she answered sweetly."
7728,289-121665-0036.flac," the little shepherdus was overjoyed at this discovery, and reaching up her crook, she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock. but how to fasten them, on to her sheep again, was the question."
7729,289-121652-0029.flac, which it is said was printed by john worthington and son in the strand london in 1712 under the name of yee melodius rhymes of mother goose. but even the story of martha gooch
7730,289-121652-0000.flac," none of us, whether children or adults, needs an introduction to mother goose. those things which are earliest impressed upon our minds cling to them most tenaciously. the snatches sung in the nursery are never forgotten."
7731,289-121652-0004.flac," are evidently drawn from a variety of sources. while they are taken all together, a happy union of rhyme, wit,"
7732,289-121652-0024.flac," is of about the same date as boston's. they're lived in a town in sussex, about the year 1704, an old woman named martha gooch. she was a capital nurse and in great demand to care for newly born babies. therefore,"
7733,289-121652-0003.flac," the ballads of the nursery follow us from childhood to old age, and they are readily brought from memories recesses at any time to amuse our children or our grandchildren. the collection of jingles we know and love as the melodies of mother goose"
7734,289-121652-0031.flac," in 1785. none of the earlier editions, however, contained all the rhymes so well known at the present day, since every decade has added its quota to the mass of jingles attributed to mother goose."

7736,289-121652-0028.flac," at one time, mr. scooch was nursing a child of mr. ronald barkley, a physician residing in the town, and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them. in time, he wrote them all down and made a book of them."
7737,289-121652-0005.flac," the research after the author of each individual verse would indeed be hopeless. it would be folly to suppose them all the composition of uneducated old nurses for many of them contain much reflection, wit, and melody."
7738,289-121652-0030.flac," is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence. the earliest english edition of mother goose's melodies that is absolutely authentic was issued by john newbury of london about the year 1760, and the first authentic american edition"
7739,289-121652-0022.flac," indeed, as mr. william h. whitmore points out in his clever monograph upon mother goose, albany 1889, it is very doubtful whether in 1719,"
7740,289-121652-0009.flac," which contained many of the identical pieces that have been handed down to us, but the name of mother goose was evidently not then known. in this edition were the rhymes of little jack homer, old king cole, mistress mary, sing a song of six pents,"

7744,289-121652-0013.flac," america bases her claim to mother goose upon the following statement, made by the late john fleet elliott, a descendant of thomas fleet, the printer. at the beginning of the 18th century, there lived in boston a lady named eliza goose."
7745,289-121652-0034.flac," it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth or a living eliza goose, martha gooch, or the miao oy of perou. the songs that cluster around her name are what we love."

7747,289-121652-0007.flac," are debtless offshoots from ancient folklore songs and have descended to us through many centuries. the connection of mother goose with the rhymes which bear her name is difficult to determine, and in fact, three countries claim her for their own."
7748,289-121652-0006.flac," it is said that shelley wrote pussycat mu and dean swift, little bo peep, and these assertions are as difficult to disprove as to prove. some of the older verses, however, are the most difficult ones to prove."
7749,289-121652-0026.flac," seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them that they began to call her mother goose, in derision. the term being derived from queen goosefoot, the mother of charlemagne. the old nurse paid no attention to our critics."
7750,289-121652-0023.flac," boston children at that date says mr. whitmore, or fed upon gospel food, and it seems extremely improbable that an addition could have been sold."
7751,289-121652-0027.flac," but continued to sing her rhymes as before. four, however much grown people might laugh at her, the children seemed to enjoy them very much, and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses."
7752,289-121652-0011.flac," although perot's tales differ materially from those we now know under this title. they comprised the sleeping beauty, the fairy, little red riding hood, blue beard, pussin boots,"

7754,289-121652-0025.flac," through long years of service as nurse, she came to be called mother gooch. this good woman had one peculiarity. she was accustomed to crune queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges, and these rhymes"
7755,289-121652-0001.flac," nor are they ever recalled without bringing back with them marades of slumbering feelings and half-regarding images. we hear the sweet, low voice of the mother, singing soft lullabies to her darling."
7756,289-121652-0037.flac," for that reason, i have written this book. in making the stories, i have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes, and my hope is that the little ones will like them, and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations."
7757,289-121652-0021.flac," repeated researchers at worcester having failed to bring to light the supposed copy, and no record of it appearing on any catalog there, we made dismiss the entire story with the supposition that mr. elliott misunderstood the remarks made to him."
7758,289-121652-0020.flac," but the rest of the story is unsupported by any evidence whatever. in fact, all that mr. elliott knew of it was the statement of the late edward a. cronin shield of boston that he had seen fleets addition in the library of the american antiquarian society."

7766,289-121652-0035.flac," and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does mother goose herself. many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves, telling their story tersely but completely. there are others which are but bear suggestions."
7767,289-121652-0032.flac," some of the earlier verses have become entirely obsolete, and it is well they have for many were crude and silly and others were coarse. it is simply a result of the greater refinement of modern civilization."
7768,696-92939-0005.flac," she studied at the london hospital, a place we are told where the hardest and most difficult conditions prevailed, and where the nurses were worked to the limit of their strengths. she also held the position of a nurse into other hospitals."
7769,696-92939-0009.flac," but her mother was close to her heart, and she saw her as often as she could. i may be looked on as an old maid, she is reported as saying, but with my work and my mother, i am a very happy one, and desire nothing more as long as i have these two."
7770,696-92939-0018.flac," such as the united states, no of the affair, or of what they proposed to do. but word of her plight did reach england through a traveler, and it once the british government requested the american ambassador, dr. page,"
7771,696-92939-0031.flac," only to learn later that it had indeed been declared, and that miss cavill would face a firing squad at two o'clock the following morning. mr. whitlock then urged baron von de lunkin"
7772,696-92939-0030.flac, all through the day the american legation sent message after message to the german authorities asking for information. they received none. at 6.20 in the evening they were told by a subordinate that the sentence had not been given.
7773,696-92939-0011.flac," who were later to slay her. brussels became a part of the german empire, and a tyrannical governor came there to establish his headquarters, issuing proclamations threatening the belgians with death for minor offenses, and filling brussels with spies and intrigue."
7774,696-92939-0016.flac," on the night of august 5, 1915, we are told, miss cavill was tying up the wounds of a wounded german soldier when a group of armed men entered the room and their leader told her roughly that she was under arrest."
7775,696-92939-0017.flac," a blow was the only response when she tried to expostulate. she was taken to prison and placed in solitary confinement. her arrest was shrouded with the most careful secrecy, but the germans did not want to have the representatives of neutral governments."
7776,696-92939-0027.flac," he did everything possible to secure her pardon, or at least a moderation of the punishment. he wrote to baron von de lunkin, pointing out in a clear and decisive manner that miss caval had served the germans by caring for their wounded."
7777,696-92939-0003.flac," and were taught the value of leading useful lives and the glory of self-sacrifice. as was customary at the time when she was a young girl, she received her education on the continent, attending school in the city of brussels in belgium."
7778,696-92939-0007.flac," and at first, they were inclined to look upon miss cavill as an untrained outsider. but her tact, efficiency and skill soon won the hearts of these good women, who afforded her every courtesy and entered into cordial cooperation with her."
7779,696-92939-0015.flac," and soon spies began to come to the governor with tales and fabrications of the crimes that she had been committing in their eyes. they bore witness that she had given an overcoat to a frenchman who was cold and hungry, and the frenchman later escaped over the dutch frontier."
7780,696-92939-0012.flac," miss cavill desired to continue her hospital work and went to the governor, von bissing, to get permission to do so. he granted it for the quiet english nurse made an impression upon him. we are told that the arrogant german formed a high opinion of her."
7781,696-92939-0019.flac," to get with information he could from brand whitlock, the american minister in belgium. he went at once to the german authorities, but they evaded his questions and waited ten days before giving him a reply. then the germans sent him a statement."
7782,696-92939-0039.flac," after the execution, they refused to return the body. but the name of edith cavill has become one of the world's great names, and her fame grows brighter as time passes."
7783,696-92939-0032.flac," to mitigate the sentence, and at 11 in the evening he was told that von bissing refused to do anything to save miss cavill's life. at the same time that the governor denied this appeal, edith cavill was allowed to see a british chaplain. she told him that she was not in the least afraid of death."
7784,696-92939-0034.flac," early in the morning with her eyes bandaged, miss cavill was let out to face the rifles of the huns. she wore an english flag over her bism. only germans were witnesses of the execution, but the german chaplain who attended said that she died like a heroine."
7785,696-92939-0002.flac," her father was an english minister of the old school, who was rector of a single parish in norwich for more than half a century. edith and her sister were brought up in strict conformance with church ideas."
7786,696-92939-0013.flac," so much so that he secretly determined to keep her under the strictest supervision. from that time on spies dogged her tracks. she cared for the wounded german soldiers and nursed a number of german officers, as well as the belgians who were in her care."
7787,696-92939-0004.flac," she then returned to her home and remained there until, when 21 years old and resolved to give her life to some useful and benevolent occupation, she decided to become a trained nurse and went to london to study that calling."
7788,696-92939-0008.flac," her home succeeded so well that three years after its commencement, miss cavill started also a training school for nurses. she was popular everywhere in the belgian capital."
7789,696-92939-0038.flac," she was tried with great haste and with great secrecy, and after the trial the sentence was carried out far more speedily than usual. moreover, they had deceived mr. whitlock and the other members of the american legation and had done so deliberately."
7790,696-92939-0021.flac," for she was not accused at any time of having been a spy. but they had planned to try her for her life, and mr. whitlock soon guessed this, in spite of the fact that the germans kept their preparations from him so far as possible."
7791,696-92939-0020.flac," and furnishing them with guides to help them to the dutch frontier, once they might escape into holland and return to england. this was the german statement. if what they said were true, there was still no cause for killing the unfortunate woman in their power."
7792,696-92939-0033.flac," and willingly gave her life for her country. her words resembled those of florence nightingale that have been quoted elsewhere in this book. death, she said, was well known to her, and she had seen it so often that it was not strange or fearful to her."
7793,696-92939-0026.flac," was calm, dignified, and brave at the trial, and faced her accusers heroically. she was dressed in her nurse's uniform, and wore the badge of the red cross. when mr. whitlock learned that she had been tried and sentenced to death,"
7794,696-92939-0023.flac," another lawyer, who was a belgian, suddenly appeared and told the americans that there was not the least cause for them to worry, as miss kappa was sure to receive only just treatment. he also promised to let them know when the trial was to take place."
7795,696-92939-0022.flac," an american lawyer, mr. delevel, was requested by mr. whitlock to take miss cavill's case and do whatever was possible in her behalf. he was not allowed to see the prisoner and was not even allowed to look at the documents in the case until the trial began."
7796,696-92939-0000.flac," chapter 29. edith cavall as the name of florence nightingale became world famous at the close of the crimean war more than sixty years ago, the name of another english nurse who suffered martyrdom in the world war"
7797,696-92939-0010.flac," when war was declared, miss cavillos no time in hurrying back to brussels, believing that her duty called her there. she wrote a letter commenting on the german army when it swept through belgium, and in it she voiced her pity for the tired, footsoar german soldiers."
7798,696-92939-0006.flac," the shortage in firmerie in hawxton and the st. pancras in firmerie. and she gained a reputation both for hard work and deficiency, while her patients often spoke of her gentleness and her kindness. not content with forgetting a patient when discharged from the hospital,"
7799,696-92939-0024.flac, and that he would keep them informed of all the developments in the case. all these promises were broken. it is true that he sent a note a few days before the trial telling mr. whitlock that the case was about to come to court.
7800,696-92939-0001.flac," will go down into history with the luster of glory and self-sacrifice surrounding it. that name is edith cavill. edith cavill was born at swartiston in norwich, england in 1873."
7801,696-92939-0025.flac," he never informed them that the death sentence had been imposed. he never came to see them afterward, and when they sought him for an explanation and for assistance, he had disappeared. miss cavill was kept in solitary confinement for two months."
7802,696-92939-0014.flac," but this made no difference to the authorities. they were determined to detect her in some crime and penisher. it was not fitting they thought that an enemy should be engaged in works of mercy, even though they themselves might benefit thereby."
7803,696-92939-0029.flac, but i appeal to your generosity of heart to support it and save this unfortunate woman from death. have pity on her. brand witlock.
7804,696-92939-0035.flac," when her death became known, the entire civilized world was shocked and horrified. in england, this murder did more to stimulate recruiting than anything else up to that time. all day long, lines of men waited to sign the papers of enlistment."
7805,696-92939-0036.flac," and in miss cavill's hometown, every eligible man was sworn into the army. a bitter denunciation of the german act was made by sir edward gray. the germans themselves had only a poor excuse for what they had done."
7806,696-92939-0037.flac," in brief, the case against the german authorities is as follows. they had not previously inflicted the death penalty for the offense of which miss caval was accused. they had kept her in solitary confinement and prevented her from consulting an advocate up to the time of her trial."
7807,696-92939-0028.flac," and that the death sentence had never before been inflicted for the crime of which she was accused. he also wrote a note to the baron, which is as follows. my dear baron, i am too ill to present my request to you in person."
7808,696-93314-0064.flac," he's very, very clever. my child."
7809,696-93314-0063.flac," when he had told the girl everything and when she was able to do anything but laugh and cry and cling to him with in-hands, she said, dear, i do so hate to think badly of anyone, but do you really think that man was mistaken?"
7810,696-93314-0049.flac," covering a clear cut mask of set endurance. and there was no work that could shut out that sight, no temptation of the world, the flesh, or the devil to give him even the relief of a fight. he had no temptations. he had never had but the one."
7811,696-93314-0058.flac," that's all. the onlooker got out at the next station. short of owning to his own lie, he had done what he could to ensure it's being found out for the lie it was, or at least for a mistake."
7812,696-93314-0046.flac," he worked as he had never worked in his life because he knew that if he did not take the work he should take to drink or worse devils, and he set his teeth and swore that her lover should not be degraded. he knew that she loved him, and there was a kind of fierce pain pleasure."
7813,696-93314-0050.flac," his soul was naked to the bitter wind of the actual, and the days went by. went by and every day he knew more and more surely that he had lied and thrown away his soul, and that the wages of sin were death, and no other thing, whatever."
7814,696-93314-0042.flac," they parted. and now the onlooker dared not meet her, dared not call at the house as he had used to do. at last, the father pressed him. he went. he met her. and it was as though he had met the ghost of her whom he had loved."
7815,696-93314-0056.flac," it's better to die of a bullet in south africa than a fright in london. that roused the lover, as it was meant to do. i don't really know what business it is of yours, sir,"" he said."
7816,696-93314-0051.flac," and gradually, little by little, the whole worth of life seemed to lie in the faint, far chance of his being able to undo the one triumphantly impulsive and unreasoning action of his life."
7817,696-93314-0057.flac," but it's your business to know that they wouldn't pass a man with a heart like mine. i don't know. they're not so particular just now. they want men. i should try it if i were you. if you don't have a complete change, you'll go all to pieces."
7818,696-93314-0045.flac," with the eyes of his memory on the white face of the man he had stabbed. now the lover and the onlooker had each his own burden to bear, and the lovers was the easier. he worked still, though there was now nothing to work for more."
7819,696-93314-0060.flac," and himself answered him, liar, you have not done your best. you will have to eat your lie. yes, though it will smash your life and ruin you socially and professionally, you will have to tell him you lied and tell him why."
7820,696-93314-0054.flac," yes. speaking professionally, i think you are wrong. you lessen your chances of life. why don't you try a complete change? because, if you must know, my chances of life have ceased to interest me."
7821,696-93314-0061.flac," you will never let him go to south africa without telling him the truth, and you know it. well, you know best, i suppose. he said to himself. but are you perfectly certain?"
7822,696-93314-0043.flac," her eyes had blue marks under them. her chin had grown more pointed, her nose sharper. there was a new line on her forehead, and her eyes had changed. over the wine he heard from the father, that she was pining for the lover who had inherited heart disease."
7823,696-93314-0067.flac," i'm certain he wanted you out of the way. he wanted you to get killed. oh, how can people be so cruel?"
7824,696-93314-0065.flac," i don't mean that. i know you're all right. thank god. oh, thank god. i mean, don't you think he may have lied to you to prevent you're marrying me?"
7825,696-93314-0059.flac," and when he had done what he could, he saw that the lover might not find it out. might be passed for the army. might go to the front. might be killed. and then, well, i've done my best anyhow. he said to himself."
7826,696-93314-0052.flac," but there are some acts that there is no undoing, and the hell that had burned in his heart so fiercely when he had seen her in the other man's arms, burned now with new bright lights and infernal flickering flame tongues. and at last, out of hell,"
7827,696-93314-0048.flac," and sometimes the dreams got out of hand and carried him a thousand worlds from all that lay between them. then he had to wake up, and that was bad. but the onlooker was no dreamer, and he saw her about three times a week."
7828,696-93314-0047.flac," like that of scratching a sore, in the thought that she was as wretched as he was. that, divided in all else, they were yet united in their suffering. he thought it made him more miserable to know of her misery. but it didn't. he never saw her, but he dreamed of her."
7829,696-93314-0053.flac," the onlooker reached out his hands and caught it prayer. he caught at it as a drowning man catches at a white gleam in the black of the surging sea about him. it may be a painted spar, it may be empty foam. the onlooker prayed."
7830,696-93314-0055.flac," the lover was short with the onlooker, but he persisted. well, if one is interested in one's life, one may be interested in one's death, or the manner of it. in your place, i should enlist."
7831,696-93314-0066.flac," why should he? he asked me to marry him three weeks ago. he's a very old friend of ours. i do hate to be suspicious, but it is odd. and then he's trying to get you to south africa?"
7832,696-93314-0044.flac," i suppose it was you who saw him, by the way, said he, a tall, well set up young fellow, dark, not bad looking. i—i don't remember. lied the onlooker."
7833,696-93314-0062.flac," yelmetka fine soldier malad. i think not,"" said the lever, and he went out from the presence. this time he reeled like a man to drunk to care how drunk he looks. he drove in cabs from harley street to wimpool street."
7834,696-93314-0032.flac," what did he die of? for the answer was heart, and in it the devil rose and showed the onlooker the really only true and artistic way to develop the action in this situation, so dramatic in its possibilities."
7835,696-93314-0006.flac," and did forbids a man with an income of 150 a year to speak of love to a girl who is reckoned in eris. there are plenty who transgress the code, but they aren't all the other stories."
7836,696-93314-0017.flac," he didn't. he accepted it with his arms round her and his lips against the face where the tears now ran warm and salt. it was one of the immortal moments. the picture was charming, too."
7837,696-93314-0028.flac," the young man made a reverent note of the name, and the interview seemed played out. it's a complicated nuisance, the father-mused. it isn't even as if i knew anything of the chap. i oughtn't to have allowed the child to make these long visits to her aunt."
7838,696-93314-0016.flac," oh, how could you? of course, a really honorable young man."
7839,696-93314-0035.flac," no office in the world would ensure you. and so it was all over. the dreams, the hopes, the palpitating faith in a beautiful future. his days might be long, they might be brief, but be his life longer short, he must live it alone."
7840,696-93314-0037.flac," she said, why, you want me more than ever? but i may die at any moment. so may i, and you may live to be a hundred. i'll take my chance."
7841,696-93314-0027.flac," he only consented to a provisional engagement, took an earnest interest in the young man's affairs, and offered to make his daughter an annual allowance on her marriage. ""'at my death she will have more,' he said."
7842,696-93314-0023.flac," and called on her father to explain his position and set forth his prospects. his coming was heralded by a letter from her. one must not quote it. it is not proper to read other people's letters, especially letters to a trusted father from a child, only and adored."
7843,696-93314-0020.flac," it's got to be born, i suppose,"" he said, like all the rest of it. she's happy enough. i ought to be glad. anyway, i can't stop it. perhaps he swore a little."
7844,696-93314-0031.flac," one thing he ought to be able to remember those pretty vividly, the confounded pep. the onlooker had never done anything wronger than you have done my goodreader, and he never expected to meet a giant temptation any more than you do."
7845,696-93314-0009.flac," and though he had denied himself the joy of speaking in words, he had let his eyes speak more than he knew. and now he had reached the wall-flowers high up and was plucking them and throwing them down so that they fell in a wavering bright shower round her feet."
7846,696-93314-0000.flac," the two were alone in the grassy courtyard of the ruined castle. the rest of the picnic party had wandered away from them, or they from it. out of the green groan mound to fall in masonry by the corner of the chapel, a great maybush grew."
7847,696-93314-0011.flac," no, he was hanging by his hands above the great refectory arch, and his body swung heavily with the impetus of the checked fall. he was moving along now, slowly, hanging by his hands, now he grasped and ivy-root, another."
7848,696-93314-0030.flac," but i don't see how to develop the action. it really is rather amusing that i, i, should have to tap his beastly chest and listen to his cursed lungs and ask sympathetic questions about his idiotic infant illnesses."
7849,696-93314-0004.flac," oh, don't, she cried. i don't really want them. please, not—i wish—then she stopped, because he was already some twelve feet from the ground, and she knew that one should not speak to a man who was climbing ruined walls."
7850,696-93314-0033.flac," the illuminative flash of temptation was so sudden, so brilliant that the doctor onlooker closed his soul's eyes and yielded without even the least pretense of resistance. he took his stethoscope from the table."
7851,696-93314-0014.flac," don't, he said tenderly. don't worry. it's all right. i was a fool. pull yourself together. there's someone coming. i don't care,"" she said."
7852,696-93314-0024.flac, it's effect may be indicated briefly. it showed the father that the girl's happiness had had two long years in which to learn to grow around the thought of the young man whom he now faced for the first time.
7853,696-93314-0039.flac," but you can't give me up if i won't be given up, can you? his smile struck her dumb. it was more convincing than his words."
7854,696-93314-0021.flac," if he did, the less precise and devotional may pardon him. he had loved the girl since her early teens, and it was only yesterday's post that had brought him the appointment that one might marry on. the appointment had come through her father."
7855,696-93314-0040.flac," you'll forgive me. won't you? i didn't know. and, oh, what's the use of talking? yet they talked for hours. conventionally, he should have torn himself away, unable to bear the strain of his agony."
7856,696-93314-0015.flac," for the touch of his cheek, pressed against her hair, told her all that she wanted to know. let them come. i don't care. oh, how could you be so silly and horrid?"
7857,696-93314-0003.flac," do you want some?"" he said, and on the instant his hand had found a strong jutting stone. his foot affirmed ledge, and she saw his figure, grey flannel against grey stone, go up the wall towards the yellow flowers."
7858,696-93314-0002.flac," they shine like gold,"" she said."
7859,696-93314-0029.flac," but is uncomfortable as to think all the same. he had another caller that afternoon, he whom we know as the onlooker came to thank him for the influence that had got him the appointment as doctor to the influential insurance company. the father opened his heart to the onlooker."
7860,696-93314-0041.flac," as a matter of fact, he set by her holding her hand. it was for the last time. the last, last time. there was really a third at that interview. the onlooker had imagination enough to see the scene between the parting lovers."
7861,696-93314-0022.flac," the lover, who came to his love over strewn wall flowers, desired always as has been seen to act up to his moral ideas. so he took next day a much earlier train than was at all pleasant."
7862,696-93314-0019.flac," he turned away and went back along the green path with hell in his heart. the other two were in paradise. the onlooker felt like the third in eden, the serpent in fact. two miles away he stopped and lit a pipe."
7863,696-93314-0012.flac, and pulled himself up till his knee was on the molding of the arch. she would never have believed anyone who had told her that only two minutes had been lived between the moment of his stumble and the other moment when his foot touched the grass.
7864,696-93314-0005.flac," had loved him these two years, had loved him since the day of their first meeting, and that was just as long as he had loved her. but he had never told his love. there is a coat of honor, right or wrong."
7865,696-93314-0013.flac," caught him by the arms just above the elbow, shook him angrily as when shakes a naughty child, looked him once in the eyes, and buried her face in his neck, sobbing long, dry, breathless sobs. even then he tried to be strong."
7866,696-93314-0026.flac," and the lover was received as though that letter were a charm to ensure success. a faulty, or at least a slow working charm, however, for the father did not lift a bag of gold from his safe and say, take care. take this also. be happy."
7867,696-93314-0038.flac," oh, don't you see, too, that if there is only a little time we ought to spend it together? it's impossible, he said. it's no good. i must set my teeth in barit, and you, i hope it won't be as hard for you as it will for me."""
7868,696-93314-0018.flac," a picture to ring the heart of the onlooker with envy or sympathy according to his nature. but there was only one onlooker, a man of forty or thereabouts, who paused for an instant under the great gate of the castle and took in the full charm and meaning of the scene."
7869,696-93314-0036.flac," he had a little fight with himself as he went down wimpole street. then he hailed a handsome and went and told her father, who quite agreed with him that it was all over. the father wondered at himself for being more sorry than glad."
7870,696-93314-0010.flac," there was no sound at all but the grating of his feet as he set them on the stones, and the movement now and then of a bird in the ivy. then came a rustle, a gritty clouter, loud, falling stones, his foot had slipped, and he had fallen."
7871,696-93314-0025.flac," for to the father he seemed just like other young men. it seemed to him that there were so many more of the same pattern, from whom she might have chosen, and many of them well off, too. however, the letter lay in the prosperous pocketbook and the breast of the father's frock coat."
7872,696-93314-0001.flac," silvered in pearled on every scented still spray. the sky was deep, clear, strong blue above, and against the blue the wall flowers shown bravely from the cracks and crevices of ruined arch and wall and buttress."
7873,696-93314-0034.flac," he walked with more than his ordinary firmness of gate, as a man does who is just drunk enough to know that he must try to look sober. he walked down the street certain words ringing in his ears. hard-affected, probably hereditary weakness."
7874,696-93314-0007.flac," he drove his passion on the curb and mastered it. yet the questions, does she love me? does she know i love her? does she wonder why i don't speak? and the counter questions, will she think i don't care?"
7875,696-93314-0008.flac," when we let our emotions play the primitive games with us. but always the morning brought strength to keep to his resolution. he saw her three times a year when christmas, easter, and mid-summer brought her to stay with an aunt, brought him home to his people for holidays."
7876,8629-261140-0018.flac, in case my presence in this house of death should become known.
7877,8629-261140-0049.flac," she did not endeavour to make any corrections in her former testimony. only acknowledging that the flower whose presence on the scene of death had been such a mystery, had fallen from her hair at the ball, and that she had seen frederick pick it up and put in his buttonhole."
7878,8629-261140-0028.flac," and seeing my way perfectly in the moonlight, entered the room on the left, the door of which also stood open. it was the second house i had entered unannounced at night, and in this, as in the other,"
7879,8629-261140-0021.flac," and flung it widely from the window. then i lifted her and later where you found her, on the sofa."
7880,8629-261140-0036.flac," start a look out and give sweet water, already suffering under shock after shock of mingles surprised and wonder."
7881,8629-261140-0008.flac," and when i saw by her clearing brow, and peaceful look, that i had fully persuaded her of this. i let her speak what words she would, and tell as she was able."
7882,8629-261140-0031.flac," i hastened away and took the shortest path home. had i been more of a man, or if my visit to mrs. webb had been actuated by a more kureni-kibba motive, i would have gone at once to the good man who believed me to be of his own flesh and blood."
7883,8629-261140-0050.flac," beyond this, the inferences that afterward awakened in her mind should not go."
7884,8629-261140-0037.flac," and that's something besides justice that actuated amable in a treatment of this young man. this feeling was shared by others, and a reaction set in in frederik's favor, which even affected the officials who were conducting the inquiry."
7885,8629-261140-0027.flac," but i did not turn away, remembering my mother's anxiety, and anxiety so extreme it disturbed her final moments. i approached the front door and was about to knock when i found it open. greatly astonished, i had once passed in."
7886,8629-261140-0016.flac," she pointed to the dagger and the breast. but before i could lay my hand upon it, she called for batzi. i wandered to hear me declare before i go, such she, that the stroke was delivered by myself upon myself."
7887,8629-261140-0011.flac," she enjoined me not to enlighten him now. if by any sacrifice on my part, i could rightfully avoid it. that she was happy in having me hear the truth before she died. that the joy which this gave her was so great."
7888,8629-261140-0041.flac," she rose with a bound, not that she had anticipated had occurred. in fact, of which she could know nothing had changed the aspect of affairs and made the position of federic something so remote from any she could have imagined."
7889,8629-261140-0005.flac, and she prized every moment remaining to her because of the bliss she enjoyed of seeing.
7890,8629-261140-0013.flac," and she made me promise i would care for him to the last with tenderness, saying that i would be able to do this without seeming in propriety. since shad willed me all her fortune under this proviso. finally,"
7891,8629-261140-0010.flac," and under circumstances calculated to deceive mr. sutherland. consequently, he had never known i was not his own child."
7892,8629-261140-0035.flac," with thus be lost. you see, i had not calculated on miss amabel page."
7893,8629-261140-0014.flac," and though her strength and breath were fast failing her, she made me understand that she was worried about the zabels, who had not come according to a sacred custom between them to celebrate the anniversary of her wedding."
7894,8629-261140-0046.flac," not even for his money, for she could contemplate his loss, but for himself. what so boldly shown that he was stronger than she and could triumph over her by the sheer force of his masculine daring."
7895,8629-261140-0026.flac," but as i hastened on toward the quarter where the zebel's lived, i was seized by such a compunction for his desolate state that i faltered in my rapid flight and did not arrive at the place in my destination as quickly as i intended. when i did"
7896,8629-261140-0047.flac, with such feelings.
7897,8629-261140-0001.flac," seeing this and realizing his opportunity, frederick at once entered into the explanations for which each heart there panted. this will be overwhelming news to him, who has cared for me since infancy."
7898,8629-261140-0007.flac, transformed to mean an instant from a selfish brute into a deeply repentant man. i knelt before her in anguish. i made her feel that wicked eyes i had been. i was not
7899,8629-261140-0042.flac," that she was still in the maze of the numberless conflicting emotions which these revelations were calculated to call out in one who had a risk all on the hazard of a dying lost. she did not even know what this moment, whether she was glad or sorry he could explain so cleverly,"
7900,8629-261140-0017.flac," but when i rose to look for batzi, i found that the shock of her mistress's fatal act had killed her."
7901,8629-261140-0040.flac, when he was allowed to resume his seat.
7902,8629-261140-0015.flac," and prayed me to see the two old gentlemen before i slept. since nothing but death or dire distress would have kept them from gratifying the one way of my father's failing mind, i promised."
7903,8629-261140-0043.flac," she had not appeared enough hard to do so. to her, all self-sacrifice was an anomaly. no women of the mental or physical strength of agatha web would plan to dagger in her own breast just to prevent another person from committing a crime."
7904,8629-261140-0009.flac," it is a sacred story to me, and if you must know it, let it be from our own words in the letter she left behind her. she only told me that to save me from the fate of the children who had preceded me."
7905,8629-261140-0025.flac," and of how one of them, james by name, came to be involved in this affair. when i left my dead mother's side, i was in such a state of mind that i passed with scarcely so much as a glance through room where my newfound father set's leaping."
7906,8629-261140-0045.flac," yet how thrilling it had been to hear him plead his cause so well. it was almost worth the loss of her revenge to meet his look of hate, and dream of the possibility of turning it later into the old look of love. yes, yes she loved him now."
7907,8629-261140-0019.flac," for fear, it would make her last moment miserable."
7908,8629-261140-0002.flac," you have heard him call me son. with what word shall i overthrow his confidence in the truth and restitute of his long-beared wife, and make him know in his old age that he has wasted years of patience upon one who was not of his blood?"
7909,8629-261140-0000.flac," and gradually subside, so this crowd yielded to its awe, and man by man sank back into his seat to quite was again restored. and only a circle of listening faces confronted the man who had just stirred a whole roomful to its depths."
7910,8629-261140-0033.flac, and which i found myself placed. but the memory of a thousand pasting gratitude together with the knowledge of the shock which you could not fail to receive on learning at this late day.
7911,8629-261140-0039.flac, they butt emphasize facts already known and produce butt little change in the general feeling.
7912,8629-261140-0022.flac," james zabel, much less than for his initials on the handle. he paused. and the all occasioned by the scene he had described was so deep and decided so prolonged that his shutter passed over the whole assembly."
7913,8629-261140-0023.flac," went from some unknown quarter a single cutting voice rose in this one short mocking comment. oh, the fairy tale! was it amabel who spoke? some thought so and looked her way."
7914,8629-261140-0020.flac," but was too terrified to move her speak. and this satisfied my mother, and made her last breath one of trust and contended love. she died as i drew the dagger from a breast."
7915,8629-261140-0044.flac," where he lover, husband or son. so amma believed, and so would these others believe, also when once relieved of the magnetic personality of this extraordinary witness."
7916,8629-261140-0048.flac," how can dr. self under questions which would be much more searching now than before? she could not even decide in her own mind. she must let impulse have its way. happily, she took the right stand at first."
7917,8629-261140-0003.flac," or lineage. the wonder, the incredulity you manifest are my best excuse for my long delay and revealing the secret entrusted to me by this dying woman. and odd silence greeted these words."
7918,8629-261140-0030.flac," as i did so, he gave a sigh, but did not wake."
7919,8629-261140-0006.flac," the love, the passion."
7920,8629-261140-0024.flac," as if begging pardon for the wicked doubts which had driven him to this defense. frederick meant that looked with one so severe part took of harshness, then resuming his testimony he said."
7921,8629-261140-0032.flac, and told them of the strange and hard-wraending adventure which had changed the whole tenor of my thoughts in life.
7922,8629-261140-0034.flac," was neither her blood nor his. rose up between us and caused me, not only to attempt silence, but to secrete in the adjoining woods the money i had received in the vain hope that all visible connections between myself and my mother's tragic death."
7923,8629-261140-0012.flac," she did not regret her fatal act. violent and uncalled for as it was, for it had showed her my heart and allowed me to read hers."
7924,8629-261140-0038.flac," frederick himself felt the change and showed it by the look of relief and growing competency cast at agnes. of the questions and answers which now pass between him and the various members of the jury, i'd need give no account."
7925,8629-261140-0029.flac," i encountered a man sitting asleep by the table. it was john, the elder of the two, and perceiving that he was suffering for food, and in a condition of extreme misery, i took out the first pill my hand encountered."
7926,8629-261140-0004.flac," the astounding fact which i have just communicated to you was made known by my mother. with the dagger still plunged in her breast, she would not let me draw it out. she knew that death would follow that act."
7927,8629-261139-0013.flac," he had not meant to yield, but now that the moment had come, now that he must at once, and forever, choose between a course that led simply to personal unhappiness, and one that involved not only himself."
7928,8629-261139-0000.flac," all the witnesses who had anything to say had long ago given in their testimony, and when at or near noon."
7929,8629-261139-0050.flac," which made any attempt seem reasonable that promised relief from the unendurable burden of oppressing and disrespeudable debt. i was obliged to have money, a great deal of money, and i have to have it at once."
7930,8629-261139-0021.flac," everyone was astounded. no one had expected anything from him, and instinctively, every eye turned towards amabel to see how she was affected by his action. strangely, evidently."
7931,8629-261139-0010.flac," and the few final minutes before noon passed by without any addition being made to the facts which had already been presented for general consideration. as the witness sat down, the clock began to strike. as the slow,"
7932,8629-261139-0005.flac, and glanced at the great door of entrance with an evil expectancy that startled even sweet water. so little had he really understood the nature of the passions laboring in that venomous breast.
7933,8629-261139-0034.flac," on every face, in every shrinking form, in subdued murmurs and open cries he read instant and complete condemnation. and yet, in all his life, from boyhood to up to this hour, never had he been so worth your esteem and consideration."
7934,8629-261139-0008.flac," from which he had removed the ring, which up to this hour he had invariably worn on his third finger. in this glance of hers and this action of his began the struggle that was to make the day memorable in many hearts."
7935,8629-261139-0028.flac, did frederick move forward. the moment was intense. the coroner seemed to share the universal excitement.
7936,8629-261139-0040.flac," she was too good. it's all calumny, a wretched lie. broken to unrestrained excitement from every part of the large room. in vain, the coroner smote with his gavel. in vain, the local police endeavour to restore order."
7937,8629-261139-0064.flac," if you want my money, take it. if you want my life."
7938,8629-261139-0069.flac," and i, in scarcely better case, fell also. this, as god lives, is a truth concerning the wound found in the breast of this never-to-be-forgotten woman. the feeling, the pathos, the anguish even, to be found in this tone made this story."
7939,8629-261139-0032.flac," was almost appalling in his intensity. had it not been for the consciousness of mr. statholens near presence, the feeling would have risen to outbreak. and many voices were held in subjection by the remembrance of this venerated man's last look."
7940,8629-261139-0016.flac," and had almost touched his finger in the significant action of scent, which amabelle waited with breathless expectation. when? was it miracle? or only the suggestion of his better nature?"
7941,8629-261139-0044.flac," was the firm response. then gentlemen continued frederick, still without looking at amabel, who smiled at a quiet mockery that drew the eyes of the jury towards her move, then once during the following recital."
7942,8629-261139-0023.flac, said that gentleman after exchanging a few hurry to words with mr. courtney and the surprise nap you can do know better than give it to us at once mr. frederick sutherland. will you take the stand?
7943,8629-261139-0060.flac," land the generosity of this great-hearted woman, and if out of peace the anonymity"
7944,8629-261139-0045.flac," you know, and the public generally now know, that mrs. webb had left me the greater portion of the money of which she died possessed. i have never before acknowledged to anyone, not even to the good man who awaits the jury's verdict."
7945,8629-261139-0051.flac," as i had been told early in the evening, a small entertainment was being given, which would ensure it's being opened even at so late an hour's midnight. miss page, who will, i'm sure, pardon the introduction of her name into this narrative."
7946,8629-261139-0006.flac," smiled as she met his eye, with that curious, slow dipping of redimples, which had more than once confounded the corner, and rendered her at once the admiration and aborance of the crowd."
7947,8629-261139-0020.flac," when frederick, leaping with the bountess feet, drew all eyes towards himself with the cry, let me be put on my oath, i have testimony to give of the utmost importance of this case. the corner was astounded."
7948,8629-261139-0025.flac," go, you whispered. but in soul-thrilling atone it was heard to the remotest corner of the room. spare me the anguish of saying, what i have to say in your presence. i could not bear it. you could not bear it. later."
7949,8629-261139-0046.flac," on the other side of that door, yonder, that she had reasons for this. good reasons. reasons of which, up to the very evening of her death,"
7950,8629-261139-0066.flac, give then i want hundreds thousands now now to save myself disgrace shame prison await me if i don't have them give give and my hand went out toward it not toward her
7951,8629-261139-0075.flac," do these words. this action refers to seem incredible to you, sirs. alas, alas, they will not when i tell you. and here he cast one anxious, deeply anxious glance at the room in which mr. sutherland was hidden."
7952,8629-261139-0052.flac," has taken pains to declare to you that in the expedition she herself made into town that evening, she followed some person's step downhill. this is very likely true, and those steps were probably mine, for after leaving the house by the garden door."
7953,8629-261139-0011.flac," hasetating strokes rang out. sweetwater saw frederick yield to a sudden but most profound emotion. the old fear, which we understand, its sweetwater did not, had again seized the victim of amabelle's ambition."
7954,8629-261139-0036.flac," he would stood the clamor and began speaking again before the coroner had been able to fully restore quiet. i know,"" said he."
7955,8629-261139-0022.flac," ever forgot, though it conveyed no hint of a real feelings which are somewhat chaotic. frederick would have forgotten her now that he had made up his mind to speak, waited for the coroner's reply. if you have testimony,"
7956,8629-261139-0002.flac," he soon recognized that his own judgment was not at fault, and that notwithstanding outward appearances and the languid interest shown in the now-lagging proceedings."
7957,8629-261139-0053.flac," and so hastened until i came to the gate on high street. here i had a moment of hesitation and thoughts better enough for me to recall them at this moment, came into my mind."
7958,8629-261139-0038.flac," 8. dr. talbot, and you, gentlemen of the jury, in the face of god and men, i hear declare that misweb in my presence and before my eyes"
7959,8629-261139-0007.flac, looked away as soon as possible.
7960,8629-261139-0031.flac," and the shock, the surprise."
7961,8629-261139-0059.flac," of whose mental condition i was well aware, that it could not bring myself to make any loud noise within his hearing. yet, i had not the courage to retreat. all my hope of relief from the many difficulties that menist me,"
7962,8629-261139-0004.flac, for while she had hitherto sat under the universal gaze with only the faint smile of conscious beauty on her inscrutable features.
7963,8629-261139-0061.flac," nothing but shame and disaster awaited me. yet, how could i hope to lure her downstairs without noise? i could not. and so yielding to the impulse of the moment, without any realization,"
7964,8629-261139-0054.flac," but they passed, thank god, and with no more desperate feeling than a solid intention of having my own way about this money, i lifted the latch of the front door and stepped in."
7965,8629-261139-0047.flac," or that i was a special object of retention, or that we were under any mutual obligations at any way. why? then i should have thought of going to her and the great straight in which i found myself on that day."
7966,8629-261139-0074.flac, there are $500 in that table. take them and let them pray your way to a better life.
7967,8629-261139-0063.flac, for she rose and meeting my eye with a gaze in wood shock and some strange and point in agony totally incomprehensible to me were strangely blended she cried out no no frederick you don't know what you were doing
7968,8629-261139-0071.flac," what i must now explain is how the money in mrs. webstorre came into my possession and how the dagger she had planted in her breast came to be found on the lawn outside. when i came to myself and that must have been very soon, i found"
7969,8629-261139-0062.flac, i slipped up the narrow staircase.
7970,8629-261139-0037.flac," but if anyone who listens to me thinks me guilty of the death, i was so unfortunate that i asked to have witnessed."
7971,8629-261139-0039.flac," gave to herself the blow which has robbed us all of the most valuable life she was not murdered. it was the solemn assertion, but it failed to convince the crowd before him, as by one impulse, men and women broke into a tumult."
7972,8629-261139-0009.flac," and to him, a full attention was being given in the hope that some real enlightenment would come at last to settle the questions which had been raised by ambele's incomplete and unsatisfactory testimony. but no man can furnish what he does not possess."
7973,8629-261139-0017.flac," the memory of a face full of holy pleading rose from the past before his eyes, and with an inner cry of mother, he flung his hand out and clutched his father's arm in a way to break the charm of his own dread."
7974,8629-261139-0057.flac," i sought the master of the house with his head sunk forward on his arms, a sleep. the expected guests had failed to arrive, and he, tired out with waiting, had fallen into a dose at the board."
7975,8629-261139-0076.flac," that unknown to me, unknown to anyone living but herself, unknown to the good man from whom it can no longer be kept hidden. agatha webb was my mother."
7976,8629-261139-0015.flac," which only comes from years of self-control, were too lately awakened in his breast to sustain him now. as stroke after stroke fell on the ear, he felt himself yielding beyond recovery."
7977,8629-261139-0003.flac," but vital consequence. frederick was not visible in the great hall, but that he was near at hand soon became evident from the change sweetwater nasson amoebael."
7978,8629-261139-0065.flac," don't stain yours, don't! i did not understand her. i did not know until i thought it over afterward that my hand was thrust convulsively into my breast in a way which, taken with my wild man,"
7979,8629-261139-0055.flac, or at least to hear the sound of merry voices and laughter in the rooms above. but no sound of any sort awaited me. indeed the house seemed strangely silent for once so fully lighted and astonished at this.
7980,8629-261139-0072.flac," that the blow of which i had been such a horrified witness had not yet proved fatal. the eyes i had seen close, as i had supposed, forever were now open, and she was looking at me, with a smile that has never left my memory and never will."
7981,8629-261139-0041.flac, the title was up and over-swept everything for an instant.
7982,8629-261139-0049.flac," and quite capable of doing a very unselfish act. still, this would not seem to be reason enough for me to intrude upon her late at night with a cleaver large loan of money. had i not been in a desperate condition of mind,"
7983,8629-261139-0042.flac," of amable, smoothing out the folds of a crisp white frog with an incredulous, almost insulting smile that at once fixed attention again on frederick. he sees the occasion and spoke up in a tone of great resolve."
7984,8629-261139-0018.flac," and end forever the effects of intolerable fascination that was working upon him. next minute, the last stroke of noon rang out, and the hour was up, which amble had set as a limit of her silence. a pause."
7985,8629-261139-0019.flac," which there are two hearts if to no other seem strangely appropriate. followed the cessation of these sounds, then the witness who was dismissed. and amabel."
7986,8629-261139-0035.flac," he did not lose his determined attitude. he had observed a change in amma bell and a change in agnes, and if only to disappoint the vile triumph of the one."
7987,8629-261139-0073.flac," there was no blood on you, shumurmord. you did not strike the blow."
7988,8629-261139-0012.flac," with a fell and steady purpose. he found his right hand stealing toward the left and the significant action she expected. better to yield than fall headlong into the pit, one word of hers would open."
7989,8629-261139-0070.flac," seemed up here for the moment plausible and bad see as the coroner must have fallen when we did for i never heard her voice after the first scream, but i shall speak of her again"
7990,8629-261139-0026.flac," if you will wait for me in one of these rooms, i will repeat my tale in your ears. but go now. it is my last untreaty. there was a silence. no one ventured at this scent."
7991,8629-261139-0030.flac, infinitely more than anyone they had expected.
7992,8629-261139-0024.flac," with the noble heir from which all hesitation advanced. frederick started towards the place indicated, but stopped before he had taken half dozen steps."
7993,8629-261139-0014.flac," but those dears to him. in disgrace and sorrow, he felt himself weak into the point of clutching it whatever would save him from the consequences of confession. moral strength and that tenacity of purpose"
7994,8629-261139-0067.flac," but you mistook the action, mistook my purpose and"
7995,8629-261139-0027.flac," no one so much has made a gesture of disapproval. then mr. sutherland, struggled to his feet, cast one last look around him, and disappeared through a door which had opened like magic before him. then and not till then."
7996,8629-261139-0058.flac," this was a condition of things for which i was not prepared. mrs. webb, whom i wish to see, was probably upstairs, and while i might summon her by a sturdy wrap on the door beside which i stood, i had so little desire to wake her husband."
7997,8629-261139-0068.flac," more than the outward seeming of her life can hardly measure, plunged against it, and i can tell you no more. her blood and batsy shriek from the adjoining room swam through my consciousness, and then she fell, as i supposed."
7998,8629-261139-0033.flac," that otherwise would have made themselves heard, and despite the restrictions of the place and the authority of the police. to frederick, it was a moment of a measurable grief and humiliation."
7999,8629-261139-0029.flac, this you will believe when i tell you that i was a person mispaid followed into miss webb's house. and whom she heard descend the stairs during the moment she crouched behind the figure of the sleeping filmon. it was more.
8000,8629-261139-0043.flac," i have made an assertion,"" said he, before god, and before this jury, to make it seem a credible one. i shall have to tell my own story from the beginning. am i allowed to do so, mr. coroner? you are."
8001,8629-261139-0056.flac," i pushed the door ajar at my left and looked in, and unexpected and pitiful sight awaited me."
8002,8629-261139-0001.flac," it was defined in two faces only any signs of the eagerness and expectancy which filled its own breast justification, but as these faces were those of agnes haliday and amabel page."
8003,8629-261139-0048.flac, i cannot say. i knew she had money in her house. this side unhappyly been made acquainted within an accidental way.
8004,1235-135887-0017.flac," but as he treated all his court that day, made him eat at his table alone with him."
8005,1235-135887-0016.flac," bowed himself before the throne, with his face to the ground. the king perceiving him, made him sit down by his side, and presented him to the assembly, and gave him all the commendation he deserved."
8006,1235-135887-0008.flac," and after a profound reverence, said to the king, he judged it meat that his majesty should take horse."
8007,1235-135887-0026.flac," if he had had a design upon my life, why did he save me then? he needed only to have left me to my disease. i could not have escaped it, as life was fast decaying. for better than to fill me with unjust suspicions."
8008,1235-135887-0015.flac," and showed himself to his couriers. who, eager to know the success of the new medicine, came vividly times, and when they saw the king perfectly cured, expressed great joy."
8009,1235-135887-0007.flac," with which next morning he presented himself before the king, and following down at his feet, kissed the ground."
8010,1235-135887-0021.flac," to affect this, he went to the king and told him in private that he had some information of the greatest consequence to communicate. the king having asked what it was, sire said he."
8011,1235-135887-0003.flac," i know,"" said he, after the usual ceremonials, that your majesty's physicians have not been able to heal you of the leprosy. but if you will accept my service, i will engage to cure you without potions."
8012,1235-135887-0018.flac, but caused him to be clad in a rich robe.
8013,1235-135887-0010.flac," when the medicine i have put up in the handle of the mace is heated with your hand, it will penetrate your whole body. and as soon as you perspire, you may leave off the exercise."
8014,1235-135887-0025.flac," i am certain that this physician whom you suspect to be a villain and a traitor is one of the best and most virtuous of men. you know by what medicine, or rather by what miracle, he cured me of my leprosy."
8015,1235-135887-0011.flac," immediately on your return to your palace, go into the bath, and cause yourself to be well-washed and rubbed, then retire to bed, and when you rise tomorrow you will find yourself cured."
8016,1235-135887-0031.flac," after having represented the king's sinned bad that he ought to be where, lest on the accusation of a mother-in-law he should commit an action of which he might afterwards repent."
8017,1235-135887-0014.flac," the next morning when he arose, he perceived with equal wonder and joy that his leprosy was cured, and his body is clean as if it had never been affected. as soon as he was dressed, he came into the hall of audience where he ascended his throne"
8018,1235-135887-0028.flac," i should never pay him sufficiently for what he has done. i perceive it to be his virtue that raises your envy. but do not think i will be unjustly prejudiced against him. i remember too well what a viseer said to king sindbad, his master."
8019,1235-135887-0012.flac," the king took the mace and struck the ball, which was returned by his officers who played with him. he played so long that his hands and his whole body were in a sweat, and then the medicine shut up in the handle of the mace had its operation."
8020,1235-135887-0005.flac," do you assure me that you will cure my leprosy without potion or applying any external medicine? yes, sire, replied the physician. i promise myself success through god's assistance."
8021,1235-135887-0022.flac, it is highly dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose fidelity he has never tried.
8022,1235-135887-0006.flac," and tomorrow, with your majesty's permission, i will make the trial."" the physician returned to his quarters, made a hollow mace, and at the handle he put in his drugs."
8023,1235-135887-0020.flac," he could not be hold without envy the presence that were given to the physician, whose other merits had already begun to make him jealous."
8024,1235-135887-0024.flac," and came to settle himself at your court, for the sole purpose of executing the horrible design which i have intimated. no no vizier interrupted the king."
8025,1235-135887-0027.flac," instead of listening to you, i tell you that from this day forward, i will give that great man a pension of a thousand pieces of gold per month for his life. nay, though i were to share with him all my riches and dominions."
8026,1235-135887-0013.flac," as the physician had said, upon this the king left off play, return to his palace, entered the bath, and observed very exactly his physician had prescribed to him."
8027,1235-135887-0029.flac," to prevent his putting to death the prince, his son. what the grecian king said about king sindbad raised the vizier's curiosity, who said, i pray, your majesty, to pardon me."
8028,1235-135887-0002.flac," arrived at his court. this physician had learned the theory of his profession in greek persian, turkish, arabic, latin, syraic, and hebrew books. he wasn't experienced natural philosopher."
8029,1235-135887-0030.flac," if i have the boldness to ask what the viseer of king sidbad said to his master to divert him from putting the prince his son to death, the greshanking had the condescension to satisfy him. that viseer said he,"
8030,1235-135887-0009.flac," the king did so. and when he arrived there, the physician came to him with the mace and said, exercise yourself with this mace, and strike the ball until you find your hands and body perspire."
8031,1235-135887-0023.flac," i am well informed of what i have had the honor to reveal to your majesty. therefore do not rest in dangerous security. if your majesty be asleep, be pleased to awake."
8032,1235-135887-0004.flac," or external applications. the king listened to what he said and answered, if you be able to perform what you promise, i will enrich you and your posterity."
8033,1235-135887-0019.flac," continued every day to load him with new favors. but this king had a vizier who was avaricious, envious, and naturally capable of every kind of mischief."
8034,1235-135887-0000.flac, the story of the grecian king.
8035,1235-135887-0001.flac," there was in the country of yunnan, or greece, a king who was leperous, and his physicians had in vain endeavored his cure."
8036,1235-135884-0020.flac," go, said i to the farmer, carry home that calf, take great care of him, and bring me another in his stead immediately. as soon as my wife heard me give this order, she exclaimed, what are you about husband?"
8037,1235-135884-0038.flac, but in acknowledgment you will make your deliverer your wife as high of promised he joyfully consented but before they married she changed my wife into a hind and this is she whom you see here
8038,1235-135884-0011.flac," and finding myself moved with compassion, i could not find in my heart to give her a blow, but ordered my farmer to give me another. my wife, who was present, was enraged at my tenderness."
8039,1235-135884-0019.flac," i was more surprised and affected with this action than with the tears of the cow. i felt a tender pity, which interested me on this behalf, or rather nature did its duty."
8040,1235-135884-0023.flac," when turning his eyes bathed with tears in a languishing manner towards me, he affected me so much that i had not strength to kill him. i let the knife fall and told my wife positively."
8041,1235-135884-0033.flac, provided you first of all restored to me my son.
8042,1235-135884-0007.flac," her enmity did not stop at this abominable action, but she likewise changed the slave into a cow, and gave her also to my farmer. at my return i inquired for the mother and child."
8043,1235-135884-0024.flac," that i would have another calf to sacrifice. and not that. she used all her endeavors to persuade me to change my resolution, but i continued firm."
8044,1235-135884-0015.flac, though she seemed very fat. take her yourself. set eye to him.
8045,1235-135884-0009.flac," but as she informed me my son had only disappeared, i was in hopes he would shortly return. however, eight months passed, and i heard nothing of him. when the festival of the great behram was to be celebrated,"
8046,1235-135884-0027.flac," this is what my daughter told me,"" said the farmer, and i come to acquaint you with it. i leave you to judge how much i was surprised. i went immediately to my farmer to speak to his daughter myself."
8047,1235-135884-0035.flac," but, if thou be a man, and art changed into a calf by enchantment, return to thy natural shape by the permission of the sovereign creator."" as she spoke, she threw water upon him."
8048,1235-135884-0014.flac," i then put the mallet into the farmer's hands, and desired him to take it and sacrifice her himself, for her tears and bellowing pierced my heart. the farmer, less compassionate than myself, sacrificed her."
8049,1235-135884-0031.flac," as to what relates to my wife, i also agree. a person who has been capable of committing such a criminal action justly deserves to be punished."
8050,1235-135884-0025.flac," i come,"" said he, to communicate to you a piece of intelligence, for which i hope you will return me thanks. i have a daughter that has some skill in magic. yesterday,"
8051,1235-135884-0005.flac," she, however, employed that time to satisfy her hatred. she applied herself to magic."
8052,1235-135884-0040.flac," it being now several years since i heard of him, i am come abroad to inquire after him. and not being willing to trust anybody with my wife till i should return home, i thought fit to take her everywhere with me."
8053,1235-135884-0001.flac, we lived together twenty years without any children. her baroness did not affect any change in my love. i still treated her with much kindness and affection.
8054,1235-135884-0006.flac," the wretch carried my son to a desolate place, where, by her enchantments, she changed him into a calf, and gave him to my farmer to fatten, pretending she had bought him."
8055,1235-135884-0032.flac," only i must pray you not to take her life. i am going then, answered she, to treat her as she treated your son. to this i consent, said i."
8056,1235-135884-0028.flac," as soon as i arrived, i went forth with to the stall where my son was kept. he could not return my embraces, but received them in such a manner as fully satisfied me. he was my son."""
8057,1235-135884-0000.flac," what is more my wife. she was only 12 years of age when i married her, so that i may justly say, she ought to regard me equally as her father, her kinsmen, and her husband."
8058,1235-135884-0012.flac," and resisting in order which disappointed her malice, she cried out, what are you doing, husband? sacrifice that cow! your farmer has not a finer nor one fitter for the festival. out of deference to my wife, i came again to the cow."
8059,1235-135884-0008.flac," your slave, said she, is dead, and as for your son, i know not what has become of him. i have not seen him this two months."" i was afflicted at the death of the slave."
8060,1235-135884-0034.flac," pronounced over at words that i did not understand, and addressing herself to the calf. o calf, if thou wast created by the almighty and sovereign master of the world, such as thou appeared at this time, continue in that form."
8061,1235-135884-0016.flac," i did not inquire what he did with the cow, but soon after he had taken her away he had returned with the fat calf. though i knew not the calf was my son, yet i could not forebear being moved at the sight of him. on his part."
8062,1235-135884-0039.flac," i desired she might have this shape rather than another less agreeable, that we might see her in the family without honor. since that time, my son has become a widower and gone to travel."
8063,1235-135884-0026.flac, these two metamorphoses were made by the enchantments of our master's wife who hated both the mother.
8064,1235-135884-0036.flac, and in an instant he recovered his natural form. my son!
8065,1235-135884-0003.flac," but concealed her aversion so well that i knew nothing of it till it was too late. meantime, my son grew up and was ten years old when i was obliged to undertake a long journey."
8066,1235-135884-0030.flac," except on two conditions. the first is that you give him to me for my husband, and the second that you allow me to punish the person who changed him into a calf. as to the first, i replied,"
8067,1235-135884-0010.flac," the unfortunate mother of my son. i bound her, but as i was going to sacrifice her, she bellowed pitiously, and i could perceive tears streaming from her eyes. this seemed to me very extraordinary."
8068,1235-135884-0018.flac," with his head against the ground as if he meant to excite my compassion, conjuring me not to be so cruel as to take his life. and did as much as was possible for him to signify that he was my son."
8069,1235-135884-0013.flac, and combating my compassion which suspended the sacrifice was going to give her the fatal blow. when the victim redoubling her tears and bellowing disarmed me a second time.
8070,1235-135884-0004.flac," before i went, i recommended to my wife, of whom i had no mistrust, the slave and her son, and prayed her to take care of them during my absence, which was to be for a whole year."
8071,1235-135884-0029.flac," my good maid said, i, can you restore my son to his former shape? yes, she replied, i can."
8072,1235-135884-0002.flac," my desire of having children only induced me to purchase a slave by whom i had a son, who was extremely promising. my wife, being jealous, cherished a hatred for both mother and child,"
8073,1235-135884-0041.flac," this is the history of myself in this hind. is it not one of the most wonderful and surprising? i admit it is,"" said the genie, and on that account forgive the merchant one-third of his crime."
8074,1235-135884-0037.flac," with such a transport of joy that i knew not what i was doing. it is heaven that has sent us this young maid to remove the horrible charm by which you were enchanted. and to avenge the injury done to you and your mother, i doubt not."
8075,1235-135884-0022.flac," the wicked woman had no regard to my wishes. she hated my son too much to consent that i should save him. i tied the poor creature, and taking up the fatal knife was going to plunge it into my son's throat."
8076,1235-135884-0017.flac," as soon as he beheld me, he made so great an effort to come near me that he broke his cord."
8077,1235-135884-0021.flac," take my advice. sacrifice no other calf but that. wife, i replied, i will not sacrifice him. i will spare him, and pray do not you oppose me."""
8078,1235-135883-0027.flac," if you will believe my oath answered the merchant, i swear by all that is sacred that i will come and meet you here without fail. what time do you require then, demanded the genie?"
8079,1235-135883-0035.flac," the children all in tears made the house resound with their groans, and the father, not being able to resist the impulse of nature, mingled his tears with theirs. so that, in a word, they exhibited the most affecting spectacle possible."
8080,1235-135883-0034.flac," he then related what had passed between him and the genie, and informed her that he had given him his oath to return at the end of the year, to receive death from his hands. when they heard this afflicting intelligence, they all began to lament in the most distressing manner."
8081,1235-135883-0029.flac," to put myself into your hands. ""'do you take heaven to be witness to this promise,' said the jeanie. ""'i do,' answered the merchant, ""'and you may rely upon my oath.' upon this, the jeanie left him near the fountain, and disappeared."
8082,1235-135883-0025.flac, to bid my wife and children adieu.
8083,1235-135883-0013.flac," protested he was innocent, bewailed his wife and children, and supplicated the genie in the most moving expressions. the genie with his cemeter still lifted up, had the patience to hear his unfortunate victims to the end of his lamentations."
8084,1235-135883-0012.flac," persisting in his resolution. i must kill thee since thou hast killed my son. then taking the merchant by the arm, he threw him with his face on the ground, and lifted up his cemeter to cut off his head. the merchant, with tears,"
8085,1235-135883-0005.flac," the genie spoke to him in a terrible voice, rise that i may kill thee with this cemeter, as thou hast killed my son. and accompany these words with a frightful cry."
8086,1235-135883-0015.flac," what, exclaimed the merchant, can nothing prevail with you? will you absolutely take away the life of a poor innocent? yes, replied the genie, i am resolved."
8087,1235-135883-0038.flac," when, however, it became necessary for him to tear himself from these dear objects, he addressed them in the following terms. my dear wife and children, i obey the will of heaven in quitting you. follow my example."
8088,1235-135883-0014.flac, all this whining said the monster is to no purpose.
8089,1235-135883-0003.flac," having allighted, he tied his horse to a branch, and sitting down by the fountain, took some biscuits and dates out of his wallet. as he ate his dates, he threw the shells carelessly in different directions. when he had finished his repast,"
8090,1235-135883-0011.flac," replied the merchant. but certainly i never killed your son, and if i have it was unknown to me and i did it innocently. i beg you therefore to pardon me and suffer me to live. no! no! return the genie."
8091,1235-135883-0006.flac," the merchant being as much alarmed at the hideous shape of the monster as at his threatening language answered him trembling, alas, my good lord, of what crime can i be guilty toward you, that you should take away my life?"
8092,1235-135883-0039.flac," submit with fortitude to this necessity, and consider that it is the destiny of man to die. having thus spoke, he went out of the hearing of the cries of his family, and pursuing his journey arrived on the day appointed."
8093,1235-135883-0028.flac," i ask a year,"" said the merchant. i cannot, unless, settle my affairs. and prepare myself to die without regret. but i promise you that this day, twelve months, i will return under these trees."
8094,1235-135883-0022.flac," the sultan, without waiting for sharia to ask his permission, bade her proceed with the story of the genie and the merchant, upon which sharia's ad continued her relation as follows. f-n"
8095,1235-135883-0041.flac," brother, may i ask why you are common to this desert place, which is possessed solely by evil spirits, and where consequently you cannot be safe? from the beautiful trees which are seen here, one might indeed suppose the place inhabited."
8096,1235-135883-0033.flac," we are all overjoyed, said she, at your return. but you are alarmed by your lamentations. pray tell this to the cause of your sorrow. alas, replied the husband. i have but a year to live."
8097,1235-135883-0045.flac," they saw another old man coming towards him, followed by two black dogs."
8098,1235-135883-0007.flac, demanded the genie? did you not take dates out of your wallet?
8099,1235-135883-0047.flac," they had scarcely begun to converse together when there arrived a third old man leading him yule. he addressed himself to the two former, and asked why the merchant who sat with them looked so melancholy. they told him the reason."
8100,1235-135883-0037.flac," he gave her, in addition, as much as the law would allow him. at last, the year expired, and he was obliged to depart. he put his burial clothes in his wallet, but when he came to bid his wife and children adieu their griefs surpassed description."
8101,1235-135883-0002.flac, the fourth day of his journey. he was so much encoloded by the heat of the sun that the reflection of that heat from the earth.
8102,1235-135883-0001.flac, because he had a great desert to pass over where he could procure no sorts of provisions. he arrived without any incident at the end of his journey and having dispatched his affairs to a course again in order to return home.
8103,1235-135883-0023.flac," in the original work, shahrazaad continually breaks off to ask the sultan to spare her life for another day, that she may finish the story she is relating. as these interruptions considerably interfere with the continued interest of the stories, it has been deemed advisable to omit them."
8104,1235-135883-0042.flac," he then seated himself by the merchant, and they entered into conversation. ""'but i see days,' said cherisad, ""'and must leave off, yet the best of the story is to come. the sultan resolving to hear the end of it.'"
8105,1235-135883-0009.flac," and now it's throw one into his eye, which killed him. therefore, i must kill thee."""
8106,1235-135883-0016.flac," as soon as she had spoken these words, perceiving it was day and knowing that the sultan rose early in the morning to say his prayers and hold his counsel, shaharazad discontinued her story. dear sister, said denarazad."
8107,1235-135883-0024.flac, for heaven's sake hold your hand. allow me one word.
8108,1235-135883-0018.flac," i will wait till tomorrow. for i can at any time put her to death when she has concluded her story. having thus resolved not to put sheherazad to death that day, he rose and went to his prayers and to attend his counsel."
8109,1235-135883-0044.flac," but the sultan wishing to learn what followed be twix the merchant of the jeanne, bade her proceed with that, which she did at follows. sir, while the merchant and the old man who led the hind were conversing,"
8110,1235-135883-0043.flac," suffered her to live that day also. the next morning, dinarjad made the same request to her sister as before. my dear sister said she..."
8111,1235-135883-0021.flac," the next morning, before day, dinner's out failed not to call to her sister. my dear sister, if you be not asleep, i pray you tell daybreak, which is very near, to go on with the story you began last night."
8112,1235-135883-0048.flac, which appeared to him in so extraordinary.
8113,1235-135883-0008.flac," i did all that you say, answered the merchant. i cannot deny it. if it be so, resumed the genie, i tell thee that thou hast killed my son. and in this manner, when thou were throwing the shells about my son was passing by,"
8114,1235-135883-0049.flac," the merchant and the three old men began to lament and fill the air with their cries. when the old man who led the hind saw the genie lay hold of the merchant and about to kill him,"
8115,1235-135883-0019.flac," instead of sleeping, he spent the night in size and groans bewailing the lot of his daughter, of whom he believed he should himself shortly be the executioner. as, with this melancholy prospect before him, he dreaded to meet the sultan."
8116,1235-135883-0031.flac," but grieved on the other when he reflected on his fatal oath. when he reached home, his wife and children received him with all the demonstrations of perfect joy, but he, instead of returning their caresses, wept so bitterly,"
8117,1235-135883-0050.flac," i will tell you the history of my life and of the hind you see, and if you think it more wonderful in surprising than the adventure of the merchant, i hope you will pardon the unfortunate man a third of his defense."
8118,1235-135883-0030.flac, the merchant being recovered from his terror mounted his horse and proceeded on his journey.
8119,1235-135883-0046.flac," the old man with the hind told him the adventure of the merchant and jeanne, with all that had passed between them, particularly the merchant's oath."
8120,1235-135883-0010.flac," pardon me, cried the merchant. no pardon. exclaimed a genie. no mercy. is it not just to kill him that has killed another?"
8121,1235-135883-0020.flac," he was a gribly surprised when he found the prince entered the council chamber without giving him the fatal orders. he expected. though sultan, according to his customs, spent the day in regulating his affairs, and when the knight had closed in, retired with shah-e-zad."
8122,1235-135883-0032.flac, that his family apprehended something calamitous had befallen him.
8123,1235-135883-0040.flac, an old man leading a hind appeared in drew near him.
8124,1235-135883-0000.flac," he was obliged from time to time to visit his correspondence on business. and one day, being under the necessity of going a long journey on an affair of importance, he took course, and carried with him a wallet containing biscuits and dates."
8125,1235-135883-0026.flac," that they may not go to law after my death. when i have done this, i will come back and submit to whatever you shall please to command."" but said the jeanne. if i grant you the time you ask, i doubt you will never return."""
8126,1235-135883-0036.flac," on the following morning, the merchant applied himself to put his affairs in order. and first of all, to pay his debts. he made presents to his friends, gave liberal alms to the poor,"
8127,1235-135883-0017.flac," the remainder of it, replied sharazad, is more surprising, and you will be of this opinion if the sultan will but permit me to live over this day."
8128,1235-135883-0004.flac," being a good muslim. he washed his hands, face, and feet, and said his prayers. before he had finished, and while he was yet on his knees, he saw a genie white with age,"
8129,730-358-0015.flac," sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable. sometimes i wish to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulant sounds which broke from me, frightened me into silence again."
8130,730-358-0027.flac, and knew not how to reproduce it. i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty.
8131,730-358-0010.flac," no distinct ideas occupied my mind i was confused. i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness and numerous sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various sense saluted me."
8132,730-358-0008.flac," i knew and could distinguish nothing, but feeling pain and veiled me on all sides, i sat down and wept. soon a general light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure."
8133,730-358-0022.flac, i observe this also.
8134,730-358-0007.flac," i had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the do's of night."
8135,730-358-0033.flac, i lay up down among some straw and fell asleep.
8136,730-358-0035.flac," i proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset i arrived at a village."
8137,730-358-0017.flac, my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms. i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another.
8138,730-358-0052.flac," whitewashed and clean but very bare furniture. in one corner near a small fire sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a dis-consolid attitude. the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage, but present-slit"
8139,730-358-0026.flac," when i found this, i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants i experienced."
8140,730-358-0023.flac," when they were nearly extinguished. when night came again, i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat, and that the discovery of this element was useful to me and my food."
8141,730-358-0034.flac, which shown brightly on the white ground.
8142,730-358-0004.flac," this was the forest near ingolstadt, and here i lay by the side of a brook, resting from my fatigue until i fent tormented by hunger and thirst. this roused me from my nearly dormant state."
8143,730-358-0018.flac," one day when i was oppressed by cold, i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it."
8144,730-358-0038.flac," no wood, however, was placed on the earth which formed the floor, but it was dry. and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain."
8145,730-358-0021.flac," and then, spreading my cloak, i lay on the ground and sank into sleep. it was morning when i awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire."
8146,730-358-0002.flac," the light poured in upon me again. i walked and i believed descended, but i presently found the great alteration in my sensations. before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me."
8147,730-358-0009.flac," the moon, i gazed with a kind of wonder. it moved slowly, but it enlightened by path, and i again went out in search of berries. i was still cold, when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak."
8148,730-358-0061.flac," the meal was quickly dispatched. the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, and the old man walked before the cottage and the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures."
8149,730-358-0019.flac," in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects. i examined the materials of the fire,"
8150,730-358-0045.flac," which flowed by my retreat. the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage, it was towerably warm."
8151,730-358-0040.flac, that i might view the adjacent courage.
8152,730-358-0054.flac, the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager
8153,730-358-0032.flac," after their sufferings in the lake of fire. i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine. the latter, however, i did not like. then over we come."
8154,730-358-0005.flac," i slacked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down was overcome by sleep. it was dark when i awoke. i felt cold also and half frightened."
8155,730-358-0046.flac," and the rain-dropping branches and dank earth. i ate my breakfast with pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step. and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature."
8156,730-358-0012.flac," i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and the trees that shated me with their foliage."
8157,730-358-0063.flac, did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbors.
8158,730-358-0003.flac, the light became more and more oppressive to me.
8159,730-358-0025.flac, and the nuts and roots much improved.
8160,730-358-0051.flac," on examining my dwelling, i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formally occupied a part of it, but the pains had been filled up with wood. and one of these was a small and almost inperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate."
8161,730-358-0031.flac," his appearance different from any i had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me."
8162,730-358-0011.flac," the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon, and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. several changes of the day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other."
8163,730-358-0006.flac, as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate.
8164,730-358-0053.flac," who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sound sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. it was a lovely sight."
8165,730-358-0058.flac," and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire."
8166,730-358-0062.flac, but to my extreme wonder
8167,730-358-0049.flac," and in about a quarter of an hour, she returned bearing the pale, which was now partially filled with milk. as she walked along,"
8168,730-358-0001.flac," by degrees i remember a strong relight pressed upon my nerves, so that i was obliged to shut my eyes. darkness then came over me, and troubled me, but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes, as i now suppose,"
8169,730-358-0014.flac, and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant root.
8170,730-358-0037.flac," refuge, and a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village. this hovel, however, joined a cottage of neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late, dearly-bought experience i dared not enter it."
8171,730-358-0024.flac," and tasted much more savory than the berries i gathered from the trees. i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers."
8172,730-358-0057.flac, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. the girl madame at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed in on the fire. then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage.
8173,730-358-0044.flac," by a loaf of coarse bread, which i perloined and a cup in a bowl."
8174,730-358-0055.flac, he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a particular and overpowering nature.
8175,730-358-0041.flac," one part was open, and by that i had crept in, but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stone and wood."
8176,730-358-0060.flac," the old man had in the meantime been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions,"
8177,730-358-0064.flac," the youth began not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument, nor the songs of the birds."
8178,730-358-0048.flac, her fair hair was plated but not adorned. she looked patient yet sad.
8179,730-358-0016.flac," the moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lesson form showed itself, while i still remained in the forest. my sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas."
8180,730-358-0028.flac, i had struck across the wood towards a setting sun. i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. a great fall of snow had taken place the night before.
8181,730-358-0036.flac," allured my appetite. one of the best of these i entered, but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. the whole village was roused, some fled, some attacked me."
8182,730-358-0013.flac," which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals."
8183,730-358-0047.flac, with a palinor head passing before my hobble. the girl was young and a gentle demeanor.
8184,730-358-0029.flac," the appearance was discolored, and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground. it was about seven in the morning, and i longed to obtain food and shelter. at length i perceived a small hut."
8185,730-358-0042.flac, all the light i enjoyed came through the sky.
8186,730-358-0039.flac," however, miserable from the inclamency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man."
8187,730-358-0020.flac," the wet wood, which i had placed near the heat, dried in itself, become inflamed. i reflected on this, and by touching the various branches,"
8188,730-358-0000.flac, chapter 11.
8189,730-358-0043.flac," having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeting it with clean straw, i retired for i saw the figure of a man in a distance. and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power."
8190,730-358-0030.flac," this was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great curiosity. finding the door open i entered. an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast. he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shriek loudly."
8191,730-358-0050.flac," presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand, cross the field, behind the cottage."
8192,730-358-0056.flac, and i withdrew from the window and able to bear these emotions.
8193,730-358-0059.flac, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.
8194,730-359-0036.flac, to discover myself to the cottagers.
8195,730-359-0032.flac," where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. in the day i believed he worked sometimes for a neighboring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him."
8196,730-359-0044.flac," my thoughts now become more active, and i long to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures. i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable, and agatha so sad, i thought foolish wrench."
8197,730-359-0043.flac," and once or twice i heard them on these occasions, utter the words, good spirit, wonderful."
8198,730-359-0020.flac," and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my humble. i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse. i learned and applied the words fire, milk, bread, and wood."
8199,730-359-0012.flac," i abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts and roots, which i gathered from a neighboring wood."
8200,730-359-0014.flac, the young woman went to the door in the morning.
8201,730-359-0035.flac," of conversation, although i applied my whole mind to the endeavor."
8202,730-359-0040.flac," and they procured a sufficiency of it. several new kinds of plants are sprang up in the garden, which they dressed, and these signs of comfort increase daily as the season advanced. the old man leaning on his son"
8203,730-359-0008.flac, a considerable period of lapse.
8204,730-359-0048.flac," greatly altered the aspect of the earth. men who before this change seemed to have been hidden caves disperse themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation."
8205,730-359-0026.flac," agatha listened with respect. her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavored to wipe away and perceived."
8206,730-359-0011.flac, this trait of kindness moved me sensibly. i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption.
8207,730-359-0005.flac," they were not entirely happy. the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. i saw no cause for their unhappiness, but i was deeply affected by it. if such lovely creatures were miserable,"
8208,730-359-0028.flac," but if his countenance was more sorrowful,"
8209,730-359-0050.flac, my spirits were elevated by the enhancing appearance of nature.
8210,730-359-0016.flac, by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment. i found that these people possessed the method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.
8211,730-359-0029.flac," especially when he addressed the old man. i could mention innumerable instances which, although slight,"
8212,730-359-0025.flac," often endeavored to encourage his children, as sometimes i found that he called to them to cast off their melancholy."
8213,730-359-0034.flac," that he found on the paper signs her speech which he understood, and i ardently longed to comprehend these also. but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? i improved, however, sensibly in this science."
8214,730-359-0033.flac," he read to the old man in agatha. this reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read, as when he talked. i conjectured therefore."
8215,730-359-0017.flac," i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers. this was indeed a godlike science, and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it."
8216,730-359-0021.flac," but the old man had only one which was father. the girl was called sister or agatha, and the youth felix, brother or son. i cannot describe the delight i felt."
8217,730-359-0015.flac," she uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise. i observed with pleasure that he did not go into the forest that day, but spent in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden."
8218,730-359-0007.flac," they were dressed in excellent clothes, and still more, they enjoyed one another's company in speech. interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. what did their tears imply?"
8219,730-359-0000.flac," i lay on my straw, but i could not sleep. i thought of the occurrences of the day. what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and i longed to join them, but dared not."
8220,730-359-0024.flac," when they weren't happy, i felt depressed. when they rejoiced, i sympathized in their joys."
8221,730-359-0023.flac," as yet to understand or apply them, such as good, dearest, unhappy. i spent the winter in this manner. the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me."
8222,730-359-0046.flac, i imagine that they would be disgusted until...
8223,730-359-0031.flac," from beneath the snowy ground. early in the morning, before she had risen,"
8224,730-359-0013.flac, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
8225,730-359-0002.flac," this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. the young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind."
8226,730-359-0009.flac," it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter."
8227,730-359-0038.flac, as the sun became warmer and the late of the day longer.
8228,730-359-0022.flac, when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.
8229,730-359-0006.flac," it was less strange that i, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?"
8230,730-359-0010.flac," when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. they often, i believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves."
8231,730-359-0003.flac," enjoyed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. nothing could exceed the love and respect, which the younger cottages exhibited towards their venerable companion."
8232,730-359-0041.flac," my mode of life and my hobble was uniform. during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept. the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends."
8233,730-359-0030.flac, in the midst of poverty and want.
8234,730-359-0004.flac, and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them.
8235,730-359-0001.flac, which influenced their actions. the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal.
8236,730-359-0047.flac," and led me to apply with fresh art or to the acquiring of the art of language. my organs were indeed harsh but supple, and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease."
8237,730-359-0019.flac," not having any apparent connection with visible objects. i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference. by great application, however,"
8238,730-359-0039.flac," from this time, felix was more employed, and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared."
8239,730-359-0045.flac," that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. when i slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father."
8240,730-359-0049.flac," happy, happy earth. fit habitation for gods, which so short a time before."
8241,730-359-0018.flac, but i was baffled and every attempt i made for this purpose.
8242,730-359-0042.flac," when they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was starlight,"
8243,730-359-0027.flac," and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. it was not thus with felix. he was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractice senses he appears to have suffered more deeply than his friends."
8244,730-359-0037.flac, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure.
8245,730-360-0027.flac," he had chosen this work, he said, because the the climateary style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors."
8246,730-360-0020.flac, the days now pass this peacefully as before with the sole alteration that...
8247,730-360-0039.flac, except through means which i obtained by stealth.
8248,730-360-0022.flac," in the meanwhile, also, the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with immunoomerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes. stars of pale radiance among the moonlit woods. the sun became warmer, the nights clear and bombing."
8249,730-360-0004.flac," that he inquired the cause of the sun sorrow. felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door. it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a countryman as a guide."
8250,730-360-0008.flac," every trade of sorrow vanished from his face, and an instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed capable."
8251,730-360-0012.flac," she was neither understood, by nor herself understood the cottagers. they made many signs which i did not comprehend, and i saw that her presence defused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their soar o'er as the sun dissipates the morning mist."
8252,730-360-0005.flac," the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent the name of felix."
8253,730-360-0028.flac, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world. it gave me an insight into the manner's governments and religions of the different nations of the earth.
8254,730-360-0021.flac," and the countenance of my friends. safi was always gay and happy. she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors."
8255,730-360-0031.flac," and at another, as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honor that can be full of sensitive being. to be base and vicious, as many on-record have been, appeared."
8256,730-360-0043.flac," all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing. from my earliest remembrance, i had been as i then was in height and proportion."
8257,730-360-0025.flac," who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, while sti-comprehended and can imitate almost every word that was spoken. while i improved in speech, i also learned the science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me,"
8258,730-360-0035.flac," united with riches. a man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slain, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few."
8259,730-360-0003.flac," that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression. he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and i conjectured."
8260,730-360-0023.flac," although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for i never ventured abroad during daylight."
8261,730-360-0037.flac," sensations of hunger, thirst and heat. of what a strange nature is knowledge."
8262,730-360-0015.flac," retired early. when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said goodnight sweet saffy. he sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name, i conjectured that their lovely guest"
8263,730-360-0034.flac," i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalad poverty of rank, descent and noble blood."
8264,730-360-0006.flac," on hearing this word, felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil,"
8265,730-360-0026.flac," the book from which felix instructed safi was volnay's ruins of empires. i should not have understood the purp, purport of this book had not felix in reading it."
8266,730-360-0001.flac, it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and merma.
8267,730-360-0007.flac, and her complexion wonderfully fair.
8268,730-360-0000.flac," i now hasten to the more moving part of my story. i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what i had been, had made me what i am."
8269,730-360-0018.flac," when she had finished, she gave the guitar to agatha, who at first declined it. she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger."
8270,730-360-0024.flac," my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language, and that i may boast."
8271,730-360-0011.flac," and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately."
8272,730-360-0019.flac," the old band appeared in rapshard and said some words with agatha endeavored to explain to safi, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music."
8273,730-360-0013.flac," and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which i did not comprehend."
8274,730-360-0036.flac," and what was i, of my creation, and creator i was absolutely ignorant, but i knew that i possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property."
8275,730-360-0040.flac," measurable, unhappy wrench. other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply."
8276,730-360-0014.flac," presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound, which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavoring to learn their language, and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end."
8277,730-360-0016.flac," was the subject of their conversation. i i already desired to understand them and met every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible. the next morning felix went out to his work,"
8278,730-360-0002.flac, my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand sense of delight and a thousand sights of beauty. it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labor. the old man played on his guitar.
8279,730-360-0033.flac," or even why there were laws and governments, but when i heard details of the vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing. every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me."
8280,730-360-0041.flac, how the father doded on the smiles of the infant.
8281,730-360-0017.flac," and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished, the arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so intransingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes."
8282,730-360-0029.flac," degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire of shivary, christianity, and kings. i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere."
8283,730-360-0042.flac, no mother had blessed me with smiles or caresses.
8284,730-360-0010.flac," she did not appear to understand him, but smiled. he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage."
8285,730-360-0009.flac," she appeared affected by different feelings, wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes."
8286,730-360-0038.flac," and that was death, a state of which i feared yet did not understand."
8287,730-360-0030.flac," inhabitants. these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings, was man indeed at one so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base."
8288,730-360-0032.flac, a condition more object that
8289,730-360-0044.flac," i had never yet seen a being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. what was i?"
8290,83-9960-0044.flac," ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement. at the same time, marius heard below him at the base of the partition, but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy conducted in a low tone."
8291,83-9960-0026.flac," finally, he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious tone."
8292,83-9960-0024.flac," was safe. while his exasperated wife, vosif, raided,"
8293,83-9960-0029.flac," and had then straightened himself up again. and now, to nardier, the female to nardier and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at the extremity of the havall."
8294,83-9960-0032.flac, are to jewelers work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry. there are ben venuto chilinis in the galleys.
8295,83-9960-0042.flac," the horrible, blowing tool disappeared into the night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow. the prisoner resumed. do what you please with me. he was disarmed."
8296,83-9960-0037.flac," they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the zoo. it is probable that the prisoner had this zoo piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal it in his hand."
8297,83-9960-0031.flac," when the police made their dissent on it. this soupies was one of those marvels of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the galley's in the shadows and for the shadows. marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape."
8298,83-9960-0025.flac," for several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage reverie."
8299,83-9960-0056.flac, with written names thrown into a hat? would you like my hat? cry to voice on the threshold.
8300,83-9960-0030.flac," stared at him in stupifaction, as almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red hot chisel, which emitted a threatening glow."
8301,83-9960-0018.flac, false address! the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again. she resumed. nobody there!
8302,83-9960-0043.flac," ""'seize him,' said to nardier. two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked man with a ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him."
8303,83-9960-0039.flac," that you can make me write what i do not choose to write, that you can make me say what i do not choose to say. he stripped up his left sleeve and added, see here."
8304,83-9960-0050.flac," softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paper round it, and tossed the hole through the crevice into the middle of the den. it was high time. the denardi a had conquered his last fears or his last scruples."
8305,83-9960-0041.flac," the revolts of the flesh and the senses, when subjected to physical suffering, cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow. justice rebellion's among the soldiery forced the captain to show himself."
8306,83-9960-0023.flac," and after all that racing and feed to the coachman and all, i spoke to both the porter and the portress, a fine stout woman, and they know nothing about him."" marius breathed freely once more."
8307,83-9960-0022.flac, it's nothing but a big carriage gate!
8308,83-9960-0036.flac, he possesses liberty. it was a large zoo of this sort.
8309,83-9960-0038.flac," as he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he had not cut the bonds of his left leg. the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise. be easy."
8310,83-9960-0040.flac," at the same moment, he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle."
8311,83-9960-0019.flac," she paused choking, then went on."
8312,83-9960-0054.flac," replied to nardier. since punnine has thrown the stone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on that side. the mask, with the ventriloquists' voice deposited his huge key on the floor,"
8313,83-9960-0052.flac," to nardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle. it's in epinean's handwriting, the devil. he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near."
8314,83-9960-0017.flac," he had hardly uttered the words, when the tenardi ae woman did, in fact, rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes, and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously."
8315,83-9960-0035.flac," in this box he hides a watch spring. and this watch spring, properly handled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sue. not at all."
8316,83-9960-0016.flac," in the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shot again. the prisoner made a movement in his bonds. here's the bush waws, said to nardier."
8317,83-9960-0055.flac," to nardier exclaimed, are you mad? are you crazy? what a pack of boobies! you want to waste time, do you? draw lots, do you? buy a wet finger, buy a short straw."
8318,83-9960-0048.flac," marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of despair. all at once a shudder ran through him. at his feet on the table a bright ray of light from the full moon"
8319,83-9960-0020.flac," you are too good, you see. if it had been me, i'd have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with. and if he had acted ugly, i'd have boiled him alive. he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is."
8320,83-9960-0045.flac, there is only one thing left to do. cut his throat! that's it. it was the husband and wife taking counsel together. tynardier walked slowly towards the table.
8321,83-9960-0051.flac," she handed it to her husband. where did this come from? demanded to nardier. party, ejaculated his wife, where do you suppose it came from? through the window, of course."
8322,83-9960-0033.flac," the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden handled knife to saw a sue into two thin plates."
8323,83-9960-0046.flac, opened the drawer and took out the knife. marius fretted with a handle of his pistol. unprecedented perplexity. for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience.
8324,83-9960-0015.flac, marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart-breaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none.
8325,83-9960-0047.flac," the one, in joining him to respect his father's testament, the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony. up to that moment,"
8326,83-9960-0028.flac," the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg. before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward, he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hands to the razor,"
8327,83-9960-0049.flac," this was the expedient of which he was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim. he knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet of paper."
8328,83-9960-0021.flac, and where he keeps his shiners. that's the way i should have managed matters. people are perfectly right when they say that men are ideal stupider than women.
8329,83-9960-0053.flac," asked the tinarda woman, we haven't the time. through what?"
8330,83-9960-0027.flac," what did you expect to gain by that? to gain time, cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the same instant he shook off his bonds, they were cut."
8331,83-9960-0034.flac," to hollow out these plates without affecting the cornage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the su in such a manner that the plates will adhere again. this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will. it is a box."
8332,83-9960-0006.flac, they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. your young lady will be taken to it. she will alight from the fiacar.
8333,83-9960-0002.flac, almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters. he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature.
8334,83-9960-0001.flac," this was what mario's perceived most clearly of all. a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene. there he stood."
8335,83-9960-0007.flac," my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tell us it's done. as for the young lady, no harm will be done to her."
8336,83-9960-0003.flac," and then i will give my life and my blood, if necessary, but i will deliver her. nothing shall stop me."" nearly half an hour passed in this manner. tinariae seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections."
8337,83-9960-0005.flac, think that the lark really is your daughter.
8338,83-9960-0009.flac," the prisoner uttered not a syllable. after a pause, tynardier continued. it's very simple as you see. there'll be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done."
8339,83-9960-0000.flac," the enigma was more impenetrable than ever. who was this little one whom tanardier had called the lark? was she his or soon? the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the lark,"
8340,83-9960-0014.flac," it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained. this frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour, was changing its aspect every moment."
8341,83-9960-0011.flac," as soon as my wife returns and says to me, the lark is on the way. we will release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. you see that our intentions are not evil."
8342,83-9960-0010.flac," i'm telling you how things stand. i warn you so that you may be prepared."" he paused. the prisoner did not break the silence, and tynardi ae resumed."
8343,83-9960-0008.flac," and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little 200,000 francs, she will be returned to you. if you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark. that's all."
8344,83-9960-0012.flac, what? that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back? one of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness? with her? and what if it were she? it was clear that it was she.
8345,83-9960-0013.flac," what was he to do? discharge the pistol? place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice? but the horrible man with a meat axe would, nonetheless, be out of reach with the young girl."
8346,83-9960-0004.flac," the prisoner did not stir. still, marius fancied that it intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner. all at once, tinarrié addressed the prisoner."
8347,83-3054-0008.flac," and many of them being separated by the violence of the shock, they fell upon a crab tree which was growing below them. they have, like the farina of plants, united and produced a fish resembling both."
8348,83-3054-0009.flac," i endeavored to bring one with me, but it was too cumbersome, and my saltwater pegassus seemed much displeased at every attempt to stop his career whilst i continued upon his back."
8349,83-3054-0012.flac," not only able, but really wished to devour us. now, as my rose and ante was blind, i had these hungry gentleman's attempts to guard against, in addition to my other difficulties."
8350,83-3054-0014.flac," when i came close, i perceived her hand move. i took it into mine and brought her on shore as a corpse. and apothecary, who had just been instructed by dr. haas,"
8351,83-3054-0006.flac," the periwinkle is a kind of shrub. it grows at the foot of the oyster tree, and twines round it as the ivy does the oak."
8352,83-3054-0017.flac," and let her make the impression of her fingers upon the waves rather than his face. he was not much out in his ideas of the consequence. for, meeting no opposition, she went directly overboard."
8353,83-3054-0004.flac," are said to be upwards of one hundred fathoms below the surface of the sea. on the sides of which there was a great variety of tall, noble trees loaded with marine fruit, such as lobsters, crabs, oysters, scallops,"
8354,83-3054-0002.flac," i will now faithfully give you in his own words, as i heard him relate to them to his friends several times. on my arrival, says my father, at hell-vetsless, i was observed to breathe with some difficulty."
8355,83-3054-0005.flac," fruit shook off the branches of the tree at groze upon by the motion of the water, as those in our gardens are by that of the wind. the lobster trees appeared the richest, but the crab and oysters were the tallest."
8356,83-3054-0001.flac," i omitted several very material parts in my father's journey across the english channel to holland, which, that they may not be totally lost,"
8357,83-3054-0019.flac," he found this gentle creature waiting his arrival, and learned the means by which she came into the world again."
8358,83-3054-0013.flac," as we drew near the dutch shore, and the body of water over our heads did not exceed twenty fathoms, i thought i saw a human figure in a female dress then lying on the sand before me, with some signs of life."
8359,83-3054-0016.flac," followed him in an open boat. as soon as she had got on the quarter-deck, she flew at her husband, and attempted to strike him with such impetuousity, that he thought it most prudent to slip on one side."
8360,83-3054-0011.flac," therefore, i had no inclination to prolong the time. add to this, my situation was in other respects very unpleasant. i met many large fish who were, if i could judge by their open mouths,"
8361,83-3054-0007.flac," as she sank, she fell upon her side and forced a very large lobster tree out of its place. it was in the spring when the lobsters were very young."
8362,83-3054-0000.flac, a woman's life saved the cause of her falling into the sea.
8363,83-3054-0003.flac," carrying their heads at the extremity of their tails. i crossed, continued he, one prodigious range of rocks equal in height to the alps, the tops or highest parts of these marine mountains,"
8364,83-3054-0010.flac," besides, i was then, though galloping over a mountain of rocks that lay about midway, the passage, at least 500 fathom below the surface of the sea, and began to find the want of air inconvenient."
8365,83-3054-0018.flac," and it was my unfortunate lot to lay the foundation for bringing this happy pair together again. i can easily conceive what execrations the husband loaded me with, when, on his return,"
8366,83-3054-0015.flac," of london treated her properly and she recovered. she was the rib of a man who commanded a vessel belonging to hell that's list. he was just going out of port on a voyage, when she, hearing he had got a mistress with him,"
8367,83-11691-0012.flac," well, think of that. udo showed what he thought of it by waving it peevishly. this is not a time for tact, he said. tell me what i look like. cornell considered for a moment."
8368,83-11691-0003.flac, coronel came back from his stroll in the same casual way in which he had started.
8369,83-11691-0028.flac," really, i don't know. perhaps because i'm too unimportant. yes, that must be it. he began to feel a little brighter. obviously that's it. he caressed a whisker with one of his paws."
8370,83-11691-0008.flac," i think i'm coming out. wondering what it all meant, coronal weighted in silence. yes, i am coming out to coronal,"" said the voice. but you mustn't be surprised if i don't look very well."
8371,83-11691-0036.flac," this, he rejected at once. when you have the head of a rabbit, the tail of a lion, and the middle of a woolly lamb, the need for action of some kind is imperative."
8372,83-11691-0040.flac," already then, he had suffered in her service, so at least he would say, and so possibly it might be. coronel had thought him funny, but women had not much sense of humor as a rule."
8373,83-11691-0027.flac," and make her tell me what she knows. she knows something i'm certain. then we shall see better what to do."" udo mused for a space. why didn't they turn you into anything?"" he asked."
8374,83-11691-0015.flac," i was afraid so,"" he said. that's the cruel part about it. had i been a lion, there would have been a certain pathetic splendor about my position. i saluted, cut off, suffering in regal silence."
8375,83-11691-0014.flac," sedudo nervously. then, frankly, your royal highness looks funny. very funny. sedudo, wistfully. very funny. said coronel. his highness sighed."
8376,83-11691-0020.flac," rabbit, he sobbed, so one dignified."
8377,83-11691-0039.flac, why not? the princess hyacinth had called for him. what devotion it showed if he came to her even now in his present state of bad health. she was in trouble.
8378,83-11691-0032.flac," corinel got on his horse and rode away. as soon as he was out of earshot, he began to laugh, spasm after spasm shook him. no sooner had he composed himself to gravity,"
8379,83-11691-0034.flac," however, we'll soon get him all right."" that evening he reached the place where the cottage had stood, but it was gone. next morning he rode back to the wood. udo was gone too."
8380,83-11691-0030.flac, he murmured to himself. obviously.
8381,83-11691-0043.flac," untamable in the man they love. well, there it was. it was not as if he had coronel with him. coronel and he, in his present health, could never have gone into eurelia together."
8382,83-11691-0026.flac," it was likely that she alone could turn him back again, and that in that case he had better only threaten her. ""'i want somebody killed,' said udo, rather naturally. ""'supouse,' said cornel."
8383,83-11691-0023.flac," i was very polite to her. don't you remember my saying to you, be polite to her because she's probably a fairy?"
8384,83-11691-0000.flac," this is a painful chapter for me to write. mercifully, it is to be a short one. later on, i shall become used to the situation, inclined even to dwell upon its humorous side."
8385,83-11691-0001.flac, but for the moment i cannot see beyond the sadness of it. that to a prince of the royal house of arabi
8386,83-11691-0007.flac," corinel stopped. your royal highness' command, he began rather coldly. there was an ominous sniffing from the bushes. corinel said an unhappy voice at last."
8387,83-11691-0041.flac, she would find him strookable. and the lion in him.
8388,83-11691-0044.flac," the contrast was too striking, but he alone, high of since only help, surely she would appreciate his magnanimity. also, as he had told himself a moment ago,"
8389,83-11691-0006.flac," he said, isn't it time we were starting? we aren't starting,"" said the voice. what's the matter? what are you hiding in the bushes for? whatever's the matter, odo?"
8390,83-11691-0025.flac," was that cornell should go back that afternoon and kill the old woman. cornell pointed out that as she had turned prince udo into a quite so, sedudo."
8391,83-11691-0010.flac," it is difficult to say what he was, save that there was an impression of magnificence about his person, such magnificence anyhow, as is given by an astrican trimmed for coat."
8392,83-11691-0033.flac," then a remembrance of udo's appearance started him off again. ""'i couldn't have stayed with him a moment longer,' he thought. i should have burst.'"
8393,83-11691-0004.flac," he was not thinking of udo. he was wondering if princess hayes synth had an attendant of surpassing beauty, or a dragon of surpassing malevolence, if, in fact,"
8394,83-11691-0038.flac," so popular? to arabic, where he rode daily among his father's subjects that they might have the pleasure of cheering him? how awkward for everybody! on to eurelia then?"
8395,83-11691-0011.flac," cornel decided that it was an occasion for tact. ah, here you are, he said cheerfully. shall we get along? don't be a fool, cornel! sedudo almost crying."
8396,83-11691-0042.flac, she would find that inspiring.
8397,83-11691-0019.flac," striking. i haven't seen it, you see. to one who didn't know your royal highness."
8398,83-11691-0009.flac," i'm... i'm... corridor... here i am. sedudo, pathetically."
8399,83-11691-0021.flac," he added bitterly. how did it happen? i don't know, cornel. i just went to sleep."
8400,83-11691-0024.flac," so they held a council of war. prince udo put forward two suggestions. the first was that cornell should go back on the morrow and kill the old woman. the second,"
8401,83-11691-0037.flac, he might go back to arabic.
8402,83-11691-0013.flac," really? frankly, he asked."
8403,83-11691-0031.flac," goodbye, your royal highness."
8404,83-11691-0045.flac," but no doubt he would think of some tremendously cunning device later on. too eurelia then, with all dispatch. he trotted off."
8405,83-11691-0002.flac," roger, scurvy legs, frankly, breaks down over it. that abominable woman, he says, meaning, of course, belvane, and he has hysterics for more than a page. let us describe it calmly."
8406,83-11691-0018.flac," and where one does not laugh, one may come to love."
8407,83-11691-0022.flac," he sat up suddenly and stared at cordell. it was that old woman did it. you mock my words, cordell. she did it. moshuji."
8408,83-11691-0005.flac," there were any adventures in eurelia for a humble fellow like himself. ""'cara nell?' said a small voice behind him. he turned round indifferently."""
8409,83-11691-0016.flac," he waved an explanatory paw. even in the most hideous of beasts there might be a dignity. he meditated for a moment. every weversee in a yak, cornel, he asked. never."
8410,83-11691-0029.flac," they were afraid of me. he began to look so much happier that cornell thought it was a favorable moment in which to withdraw. shall i go now, your royal highness?"
8411,83-11691-0035.flac," he returned to the palace and began to think it out. left to himself, udo very soon made up his mind. there were three courses open to him. he might stay where he was till he was restored to health."
8412,83-11691-0017.flac," i saw one once in barodia. it is not a beautiful animal, corinell, but as a yak, i should not have been entirely unlovable. one does not laugh at a yak, corinell."
8413,2159-179157-0031.flac," their impersonations are ridiculous in the extreme. one man i remember believed himself to be controlled by the spirit of charles sumner. being uneducated, he used the most wretched english."
8414,2159-179157-0014.flac," i felt in a vague way that there were beings all about me, but could not hear their voices. i felt, as though every muscle in my body was fixed and rigid."
8415,2159-179157-0018.flac," all of which were presumably due to opium. the causes which dr. cork thinks produced the hypnotic condition, in his case, namely, belief, desire to be hypnotized, and strained attention, united with a vivid imagination."
8416,2159-179157-0010.flac," however, honesty might be at the start soon began to deceive himself, as well as others, until he lost his power entirely to distinguish between fact and imagination. before discussing the matter further,"
8417,2159-179157-0017.flac," his descriptions of dreams bear a wonderful likeness to de-quincees dreams, such as those described in the english male coach, de profondis, and the confessions of an english opium eater."
8418,2159-179157-0011.flac, let us quote dr. cox's experiment in hypnotizing himself. it will be remembered that a professional hypnotizer or magnetizer had hypnotized him by telling him to fix his mind on the number 26 and holding up his hand.
8419,2159-179157-0001.flac," that they have any peculiar power in themselves, which they exert over their fellows. one of these professionals gives an account in his book of what he calls the wonderful lock method. he says that"
8420,2159-179157-0024.flac," and possibly these two things will turn out to me much the same, in fact. on no other ground can we explain the so-called children's crusade, in which over 30,000 children from germany, from all classes of the community,"
8421,2159-179157-0016.flac," secondly, i wished to be hypnotized, these together with a vivid imagination and strained attention brought on the states which occurred."
8422,2159-179157-0021.flac," by prolonging the operation, the whole community becomes more or less hypnotized. in all such cases, however, unusual excitement is commonly followed by unusual lethargy."
8423,2159-179157-0007.flac, and how it extends to the professional subjects as well as to the professional operators. till those subjects even impose upon scientific men who ought to be proof against such deception.
8424,2159-179157-0013.flac," the roar became deafening. it crackled like a mighty fire. i was fearfully conscious of myself. having read vivid accounts of dreams, visions, etc., it occurred to me that i would experience them."
8425,2159-179157-0029.flac," is that of the mystic swedenborg, who saw such strange things in his visions, and at last came to believe in them as real. the same explanation may be given of the manifestations of oriental prophets,"
8426,2159-179157-0030.flac," for in the orient, hypnotism is much easier and more systematically developed than with us of the west. the performances of the dervishes and also of the fakers who wound themselves and perform many wonderful feats."
8427,2159-179157-0008.flac," moreover, the possibility of self-hypnotization, carefully concealed and called by another name, opens another great field of humbug and charlatanism, of which the advertising columns of the newspapers are constantly filled."
8428,2159-179157-0020.flac," for instance, the effects of an exciting religious revival are very like those produced by mesmer's operations in paris. the subjects become hysterical and are ready to believe anything or do anything."
8429,2159-179157-0026.flac, gazing steadily at a bed of bright coals or a stream of running water will invariably throw a sensitive subject into a hypnotic sleep that will last sometimes for several hours. dr. cox says
8430,2159-179157-0028.flac," with its lofty dome, or the faces of imaginary beings beautiful or demoniacal, according to the will and temper of the subject. perhaps the most wonderful example of self-hypnotism, which we have in history,"
8431,2159-179157-0006.flac, probably no scientific phenomenon was ever so grossly prostituted to base ends as that of hypnotism. later we shall see some of the outrageous forms this charlatanism assumes.
8432,2159-179157-0009.flac," namely, that of the clairvoyant and medium. we may conceive how such a profession might become perfectly legitimate and highly useful, but at present it seems as if any person who went into it"
8433,2159-179157-0023.flac," are no doubt the effect of hypnotization by the priests. some of the strange movements of whole communities during the crusades are to be explained, either on the theory of hypnotization or of contagion."
8434,2159-179157-0032.flac," and his language was utterly devoid of sense, while on the other hand a very intelligent lady who believed herself to be controlled by the spirit of charlotte kushman, personated the part very well. dr. cook says of himself,"
8435,2159-179157-0015.flac," the roar in my ears grew louder still, and i heard, above the roar, reports, which sounded like artillery and musketry. then, above the den of the noise, a musical cord. i seemed to be absorbed in this cord, i knew nothing else."
8436,2159-179157-0027.flac," that he has experimented in this direction with patience of his. says he, they have the ability to resist the state or to bring it at will. many of them describe beautiful scenes from nature, or some mighty cathedral."
8437,2159-179157-0025.flac," tried to cross the alps in winter, and in their struggles were all lost or sold into slavery without even reaching the holy land. again, hypnotism is accountable for many of the poet's dreams."
8438,2159-179157-0033.flac," i can hypnotize myself to such an extent that i will become wholly unconscious of events taking place around me. and a long interval of time, say from one half to two hours, will be a complete blank."
8439,2159-179157-0019.flac, our causes which are often found in conjunction and produce effects which we may reasonably explain on the theory of self-hypnotization.
8440,2159-179157-0002.flac," though he is locked up in a separate room, he can make the psychic power work through the walls. all that he does is to put his subjects in the way of hypnotizing themselves."
8441,2159-179157-0003.flac," he shows his inconsistency when he states that under certain circumstances the hypnotizer is in danger of becoming hypnotized himself. in this, he makes no claim that the subject is using any psychic power."
8442,2159-179157-0022.flac," in fact, it is a sort of intoxication. the same phenomena are probably accountable for many of the strange records of history, the wonderful cures at lords of which we have read in zola's novel of that name."
8443,2159-179157-0012.flac," i was intensely cold. my heart seemed to stand still. i had ringing in my ears. my hair seemed to rise upon my scalp. i persisted in the effort, and the previously mentioned noise in my ears grew louder and louder."
8444,2159-179157-0004.flac," but, of course, if the hypnotizer looks steadily into the eyes of his subject, and the subject looks into his eyes, the steady gaze on a bright object will produce hypnotism in one quite as readily as in the other."
8445,2159-179157-0005.flac," hypnotism is an established scientific fact, but the claim that the hypnotizer has any mysterious psychic power is the invariable mark of the charlatan."
8446,2159-179157-0000.flac," and it is true that a person can deliberately hypnotize himself when he wishes to, till he has become accustomed to it and is expert in it, so to speak. it does away at a stroke with the claims of all professional hypnotists and magnetic healers"
8447,2159-179154-0035.flac," he looked for a moment and then dashed down the platform into the audience and seizing the man's head vigorously rubbed it. as this did not extinguish the flames, he took off his coat and put the fire out. in doing this, he set his coat on fire."
8448,2159-179154-0017.flac," in the meantime, the act had caused great laughter among the rest of the class. one young fellow in particular laughed so uproariously that tears coursed down his cheeks, and he took out his handkerchief to wipe his eyes."
8449,2159-179154-0013.flac," they immediately began and twirled them faster and faster, in spite of their efforts to stop. one of the subjects said he thought of nothing but the strange action of his hands, and sometimes it puzzled him to know why they were world."
8450,2159-179154-0014.flac," at this point, dr. flint's daughter took charge of the class. she pointed her finger at one of them, and the subject began to look steadily before him, at which the rest of the class were highly amused."
8451,2159-179154-0006.flac," at each individual awoke him. one of the subjects, one question afterward, as to what sensation he experienced at the snapping of the fingers replied that it seemed to him as if something inside of his head responded."
8452,2159-179154-0024.flac, at the same time into the audience. the one who was impersonating a newsboy went about crying his addition in a loud voice while the hunter crawled along stealthily and carefully.
8453,2159-179154-0029.flac," she touched each one of the class in succession, and every one manifested the utmost pain and fear. one subject sat down on the floor and cried in dire distress."
8454,2159-179154-0034.flac," all the world loves a lover, as the saying is, and all the world loves to laugh at him. one of the subjects was told that the head of a man in the audience was on fire."
8455,2159-179154-0001.flac," the following is a description of a public performance given by dr. herbert l. flint, a very successful public operator. it is in the language of an eyewitness, a new york lawyer."
8456,2159-179154-0039.flac," he pointed to a suppositious canvas picture. he chaffed the boys. he flattered the vanity of the young fellows with their girls, telling them that they could not afford for the small sum of ten cents to miss this great show."
8457,2159-179154-0002.flac," in response to a call for volunteers, 20 young and middle-aged men came upon the stage. they evidently belonged to the great middle class. the entertainment commenced by dr. flint passing around the group."
8458,2159-179154-0022.flac," he was informed that he could tell who the father was by the similarity and the color of the eyes. these suggestions were made in a loud tone, as flint being no nearer one subject than another."
8459,2159-179154-0011.flac," he was then away from anyone who could influence him. he replied that the very idea was repugnant. however, he was induced to take a cigarette in his mouth, but it made him ill and he flung it away with every expression of disgust."
8460,2159-179154-0032.flac," the manner in which, little by little, he ventured upon a familiar footing, was exceedingly funny, but when in a moment of confident response to his wooing, he clasped her around the waist and imprinted a chased kiss upon the brushy part of the broom."
8461,2159-179154-0030.flac," had the suggestion been continued, it would undoubtedly have raised a blister. one of the amusing experiments tried, at a later time, was that if a tall young man, diffident, pale and modest, being given a broom carefully wrapped in a sheet."
8462,2159-179154-0023.flac," the bear suggestion was given as, now, think that you are a newsboy and are selling papers, or now, think that you are hunting and are going into the woods to shoot birds. so the party was started."
8463,2159-179154-0016.flac," then he stopped. miss flint led him to the front of the stage and left him standing in profound slumber. he stood there, stooping, eyes set, and vacant, fast asleep."
8464,2159-179154-0038.flac," then for the small sum of ten cents, they could see more wonders than ever before had been crowded under one canvas tent. he harrained the crowd as they surged about the tent door."
8465,2159-179154-0019.flac," but the moment the gesture was made, his countenance fell, his mirth stopped. while that of his companions redoubled, and the change was so obvious that the audience shared in the laughter, but the subject neither saw nor heard."
8466,2159-179154-0007.flac," and with this sensation he regained self-consciousness. this is to be doubted. as a rule, subjects in this stage of hypnotism do not feel any sensation that they can remember."
8467,2159-179154-0020.flac," his eyes assumed the same expression that had been noticed in his companions. he too arose in the same attitude, as if his head were pulling the body along, and following the finger in the same way as his predecessor."
8468,2159-179154-0008.flac," that you can't pull them apart. they are fast. you cannot pull them apart. try. you can't. the whole class made frantic efforts to unclassp their hands, but we're unable to do so. the doctor's explanation of this is"
8469,2159-179154-0021.flac," another was given a broomstick, and told to hunt game in the woods before him. another was given a large rag doll and told that it was an infant, and that he must look among the audience and discover the father."
8470,2159-179154-0009.flac," that what they were really doing was to force their hands closer together, thus obeying the counter-suggestion. that they thought they were trying to unclassp their hands was evident from their endeavors."

8473,2159-179154-0033.flac," disguised by the sheet, the house resounded with roars of laughter. the subject, however, was deaf to all of the noise. he was absorbed in his courtship, and he continued to hug the broom, and exhibit in his features."
8474,2159-179154-0025.flac," the newsboy even adopted the well-worn device of asking those whom he solicited to buy, to help him get rid of his stock. one man offered him a scent. when the price was two cents, the newsboy chaffed the would-be purchaser."
8475,2159-179154-0031.flac," and told that it was his sweetheart. he accepted the situation and sat down by the broom. he was a little sheepish at first, but eventually he grew bolder and smiled upon her such a smile as mulvolio cast upon olivia."

8477,2159-179154-0005.flac," while a few were wide awake and smiling at the rest. these latter were dismissed as unlikely subjects. when the stage had been cleared of all those who were not responsive, the doctor passed around and snapping his finger"
8478,2159-179154-0026.flac," and taking him into the center of the stage showed him a small riding whip. he looked at it indifferently enough. he was told it was a hot bar of iron, but he shook his head still incredulous."

8480,2159-179154-0027.flac," the suggestion was repeated, and as the glazed look came into his eyes, the incredulous look died out. every member of the class was following the suggestion made to the subject in hand. all of them had the same expression in their eyes. the doctor said."
8481,2159-179154-0012.flac," this is an instance of what is called post-hypnotic suggestion, dr. cocktell's, of suggesting to a drinker whom he was trying to cure of the habit that for the next three days anything he took would make him vomit."
8482,2159-179154-0015.flac," presently, the subjects head leaned forward. the pupils of his eyes dilated and assumed a peculiar glassy stare. he arose with a steady, gliding gate."
8483,2159-179154-0018.flac," just as he was returning it to his pocket, the lady suddenly pointed a finger at him."

8485,2159-179154-0004.flac," you feel very sleepy. as he did this, several of the volunteers closed their eyes at once, and one fell asleep immediately. one or two remained awake."
8486,2159-179154-0037.flac," when his mind had absorbed this idea, he was ordered to open his exhibition. he had once mounted a table and, in the voice of the traditional side show fekir, began to dilate upon the fat woman and the snakes."
8487,2159-179156-0018.flac," he believed they were in a condition of self-induced hypnotism, in which their subjective faculties were so exalted as to supersede their objective perceptions. music was no longer to them a succession of pleasing sounds."

8491,2159-179156-0012.flac, but i was painfully conscious of the two contradictory elements within me. i knew that my body existed but could not prove it to myself. i knew that the statements made by the operator were in a measure untrue.

8494,2159-179156-0006.flac," the operator said, you are going to sleep. you are getting sleepy. you cannot open your eyes. i was conscious that my heart was beating rapidly, and i felt a sensation of terror."
8495,2159-179156-0009.flac," the feeling of not wishing to open my eyes was not based upon any desire to please the operator. i had no personal interest in him in any way, but, be it understood, i firmly believed in his power to control me."
8496,2159-179156-0023.flac," the state of mind brought up before him in the most realistic and vivid manner possible the picture of the ride of tamo shantur, which he had seen years before."
8497,2159-179156-0026.flac," this subject did not pass into such a deep state of hypnotism, but the result was practically the same. the pulse rate rose from 70 to 120. the sensation remembered was that of riding furiously through the air."
8498,2159-179156-0010.flac," then he stroked the arm and said it was growing numb. he said, you have no feeling in it, have you?"" dr. caut goes on, i said, no. and i knew that i said no."

8501,2159-179156-0031.flac, appears to summon the sigmund to valhalla.
8502,2159-179156-0011.flac," the operator went on, pricking the arm with a pin, and though dr. koch felt the pain, he said he did not feel it. and at the same time, the sensation of terror increased. i was not conscious of my body at all, he says further on."
8503,2159-179156-0001.flac," the sensations produced during a state of hypnosis are very interesting. as may be supposed, they differ greatly in different persons."
8504,2159-179156-0033.flac," we'll find descriptions of many other interesting experiments in the same article. dr. cork describes a peculiar trick he played upon the site of a subject. says he, i once hypnotized a man."
8505,2159-179156-0003.flac," he was, at that time, a firm believer in the theory of personal magnetism, a delusion from which he afterward escaped. on the occasion which he describes, the operator commanded him to close his eyes"
8506,2159-179156-0008.flac," yet i was conscious that while one part of my mind wanted to open my eyes, another part did not want to, so i was in a paradoxical state. i believed that i could open my eyes and yet could not."

8508,2159-179156-0028.flac," to him, it always expressed the pictured wild ride of the daughters of wohtem, the subject taking part in the ride. it was noticeable in each case that the same music played to them in the waking state produced no special impression."
8509,2159-179156-0002.flac," one of the most interesting accounts ever given is that of dr. james r. cawke, a hypnotist himself, who submitted to being operated upon by a professional magnetizer."

8512,2159-179156-0015.flac," by fixing his mind on the number 26 and holding up his hand. this time, he experienced a still greater degree of terror and incidentally learned that he could hypnotize himself, the matter of self-hypnotism."

8514,2159-179156-0014.flac," it seemed to me that the hypnotist commanded me to awake as soon as i dropped my arm, and yet ten minutes of unconsciousness had passed. on a subsequent occasion, dr. koch, who was blind, was put into a deep hypnotic sleep."

8516,2159-179156-0004.flac," but he did open them at once. again, he told him to close the eyes. and at the same time, he gently stroked his head and face and eyelids with his hand. dr. cawke fancied he felt a tingling sensation in his forehead and eyes."
8517,2159-179156-0030.flac, and the subject seemed to contemplate a landscape of lofty grandeur. a different sort of music was played.
8518,2159-179156-0027.flac, the experiment was repeated on other subjects in all cases with the same result.
8519,2159-179156-0005.flac," which he supposed came from the hand of the operator. afterward, he came to believe that this sensation was purely imaginary on his part. then he says, a sensation akin to fear came over me."
8520,2159-179156-0020.flac, this observation suggested to him an interesting series of experiments. his first subject was easily hypnotized and of an emotional nature. vogners
8521,2159-179156-0022.flac," as the music progressed, the tension diminished. the respiration increased from 18 to 30 per minute. great excitement in the subject was evident. his whole body was thrown into motion. his legs were drawn up, his arms tossed into the air."
8522,2159-179156-0013.flac," i obeyed them voluntarily and involuntarily. this is the last remembrance that i have of that hypnotic experience. after this, however, the operator caused the doctor to do a number of things which he learned of from his friends after the performance was over."
8523,5867-48852-0022.flac," only she, poor young lady, shall be better now, mr. john, a dear better."
8524,5867-48852-0045.flac," but not the less should he have it of right, seeing that he desired it. but yet mrs. dale did not dare to get up and leave the room. lily had asked her not to do so, and at the present period of their lives all lily's requests were sacred."
8525,5867-48852-0039.flac," i don't know anybody i should so much like for a brother. i'm very glad that you like him, very glad. i hope you'll be friends always. there was some little tenderness in this as john acknowledged to himself. i'm sure we shall, if he likes it. that is if i ever happen to see him."
8526,5867-48852-0065.flac," i could not have that one thing, and i was nearer to my heart's longings than you have ever been. i cannot have that one thing, but i know that there are other things, and i will not allow myself to be brokenhearted."
8527,5867-48852-0017.flac, here he encountered hopkins.
8528,5867-48852-0040.flac," i'll do anything for my can if he ever comes up to london. wouldn't it be a good thing, mrs. dale, if he settled himself in london? no, john. it would be a very bad thing. why should he wish to rob me of my daughter? mrs. dale was speaking of her eldest daughter."
8529,5867-48852-0106.flac," and i'd already seen his handy-work. as she offended you, john,"" she said."
8530,5867-48852-0038.flac," of course, nothing is settled. it was such fun, said lily. james, who took, at any rate a year or two to make his proposal, wanted to be married the next day afterwards. no, lily, not quite that. well, mama, it was very nearly that."
8531,5867-48852-0098.flac," as it was, he did not think it possible that he should return to his place in the earls' house. how could he pretend to maintain his ordinary demeanor under the eyes of those two old men? it would be better for him to get home to his mother."
8532,5867-48852-0047.flac," to say that you think we shall not go. it was only last night that you suggested it. the truth is, john, that hopkins came in and discourseed with the most wonderful eloquence. nobody dared to oppose hopkins. he made us almost cry. he was so pathetic."
8533,5867-48852-0110.flac," if you can be constant in your love, you may win her yet. remember how young she is and how young you both are. come again in two years' time, and then when you have won her, you shall tell me that i have been a good old woman to you both."
8534,5867-48852-0101.flac," it was not only of his late disappointment that he was thinking, but of his whole past life. he was conscious of his harbly hoihood."
8535,5867-48852-0062.flac, always know to that. how can it be otherwise? you would not have me marry you while i love another? but he is gone. he's taken another wife. i cannot change myself because he is changed.
8536,5867-48852-0051.flac," and it asked all the dails there, and it offered himself up as a sacrifice at the cruel shrine of a serious dinner party. to say nothing of that easier and lighter sacrifice which he had made in a pecuniary point of view, in order that this thing might be done."
8537,5867-48852-0049.flac," john, however, remembered well at this moment all that the gardener had said to him. did she know of that encounter between him and crosby? and if she did know of it, in what light did she regard it?"
8538,5867-48852-0021.flac," he never looked at one as though one were a christian, did he, mr. john?"
8539,5867-48852-0111.flac," i shall never win her lady julia."" as he spoke these last words, the tears were running down his cheeks."
8540,5867-48852-0073.flac," she spoke in a low voice slowly, almost with difficulty, but still the words came very clearly, with a clear distinct voice which caused them to be remembered with accuracy."
8541,5867-48852-0013.flac," he had told her that he hated crosby, calling him that man, and assuring her that no earthly consideration should induce him to go into that man's house. then he had walked away moodily, wishing him all manner of evil."
8542,5867-48852-0103.flac," if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating, regardless whether he himself might be called upon to follow him. was it not hard that for the two of them, for lily, and for him also,"
8543,5867-48852-0095.flac, and it so made a fool of himself that now all hope and happiness were over for him. how could he escape at once out of the country back to london? how could he get away without saying a word further to anyone?
8544,5867-48852-0080.flac," when we do meet, let us be glad to see each other. no other friend shall ever be dearer to me than you are. you are so true and honest. when you marry, i will tell your wife when an infinite blessing god has given her."
8545,5867-48852-0029.flac," i don't know, perhaps it will be better that i should. no mama, no. what good can it do? it can do no good. i like him as well as i can like anyone. i love him dearly. but it can do no good. let him come in here and be very kind to him."
8546,5867-48852-0102.flac," of that backwardness on his part and assuming manhood, which had rendered him incapable of making himself acceptable to lily before she had fallen into the clutches of crosby."
8547,5867-48852-0090.flac," he had failed, and he acknowledged to himself with bitter approaches that he had failed now and forever. he told himself that he had abrooted upon her in her sorrow with an unmanorly love,"
8548,5867-48852-0088.flac," and then pulled out his own watch as though to verify the one by the other. he made, unconsciously, a struggle to drive away from his thoughts the facts of the late scene, and for some five or ten minutes he succeeded."
8549,5867-48852-0043.flac," and of this mrs. dale soon felt herself aware. the thing had to be done. and no little precautionary measure, such as this of mrs. dale's enforced presence, would prevent it. of this mrs. dale was well aware."
8550,5867-48852-0012.flac," and she had answered him by telling him that she loved mr. crosby better than all the world besides. of course she had done so at that time, but nevertheless her manner of telling him had seemed to him to be cruel. and he also had been cruel."
8551,5867-48852-0053.flac," should he get up boldly and ask lily to put on her bonnet and come out into the garden? as the thought struck him he rose and grasped at his hat. i am going to walk back to guest-wix, said he. it was very good of you to come so far to see us."
8552,5867-48852-0052.flac," under such circumstances, ames was too honest a man not to do it, let the difficulties in his way be what they might. he had sat there for an hour, and mrs. dale still remained with her daughter."
8553,5867-48852-0000.flac," bel had declared that her sister would be very happy to see john ames if he would go over to allington, and he had replied that of course he would go there. so much having been as it were settled,"
8554,5867-48852-0055.flac," i have a glass of wine before you go. oh, dear, no, i think i'll go back through the squires fields, and out on the road at the white gate, the path is quite dry now."" i dare say it is,"" said mrs. dale. lily."
8555,5867-48852-0081.flac," you shall never do that. yes, i will. i understand what you mean. but yet i will. goodbye, mrs. dale. you said, goodbye, john."
8556,5867-48852-0104.flac, there should be such punishment because of the insincereity of that man when he had thus stood upon the bridge for some quarter of an hour he took out his knife and with deep rough gashes in the wood cut out lily's name from the rail
8557,5867-48852-0112.flac," it was well for him that she had come upon him in his sorrow. when he once knew that she had seen his tears,"
8558,5867-48852-0030.flac," and i shall be very glad to see him. then mrs. dale went round to the other room and admitted her visitor through the window of the drawing room. we are in terrible confusion, john, are we not? and so you are really going to live in guestwick?"
8559,5867-48852-0001.flac, he was able to speak of his visit as a matter of course at the breakfast table on the morning after the earl's dinner party. i must get you to come round with me dale and see what i am doing to the land the earl said.
8560,5867-48852-0094.flac, was it not the case that he had so fondly expected success as to think only of his triumph in returning and not of his more probable disgrace? he had allowed others to make a fool of him.
8561,5867-48852-0034.flac," how do you do, john? how do you do, lily? we all know the way in which such meetings are commenced, each long to be tender and affectionate to the other."
8562,5867-48852-0066.flac," you are stronger than i am,"" he said. not stronger, but more certain. make yourself as sure as i am and you too will be strong. is it not so, mama?"
8563,5867-48852-0087.flac," as he made his way through the tombstones, he paused and read one as though it interested him."
8564,5867-48852-0009.flac, i am not prepared to say. but ames took his advice as being in itself good and resolved to act upon it. not that any resolution will be of any use he said to himself as he walked along.
8565,5867-48852-0035.flac," but neither knew how to throw any tenderness into this first greeting. ""'so you're staying at the manor house,' said lily. ""'yes, i'm staying there. your uncle and bell came yesterday afternoon.' ""'have you heard about bell,' said mrs. dale."
8566,5867-48852-0108.flac, will be a consolation when you are as old as i am. it is something to have had a heart.
8567,5867-48852-0083.flac," he looked longingly into her faces, though he had thought it possible that she also might kiss him. then he pressed her hand to his lips, and without speaking any further farewell took up his hat and left the room. poor fellow."
8568,5867-48852-0024.flac," ames passed on over the little bridge, which seemed to be in a state of fast decay, unattended to by any friendly carpenter, now that the days of its use were so nearly at an end, and on into the garden, lingering on the spot where he had last said farewell to lily."
8569,5867-48852-0050.flac, he had sworn to himself that he would not leave the small house without asking lily to be his wife. it seemed to him as though he would be guilty of falsehood toward the earl if he did so. lord degast had opened his house to him.
8570,5867-48852-0037.flac," i don't know that i am fond of such secrets. but as she said this she thought of crosby's engagement, which had been told to everyone, and of its consequences. is it to be soon, he asked? well, yes, we think so."
8571,5867-48852-0006.flac," resting when he might choose to rest, and running when it might suit him to run. and she is not like other girls he thought to himself. she won't care for my boots being dirty, so at last he elected to walk."
8572,5867-48852-0018.flac," mr. john, may i make so bold, and hopkins held out a very dirty hand, which james, of course, took, unconscious of the cause of this new affection. i'm just going to call it the small house, and i thought i'd come this way."
8573,5867-48852-0086.flac," he made his way out by the front door and through the church yard, and in this way onto the field through which he had asked lily to walk with him."
8574,5867-48852-0084.flac," said mrs. dale. they should not have let him come, said lily. but they don't understand."
8575,5867-48852-0054.flac," i was always fond of walking, he said."
8576,5867-48852-0069.flac," but it will not be so forever, lily, forever. why should he not be mine as well as hers when that forever comes? john, if you understand what it is to love,"
8577,5867-48852-0068.flac, that i loved him better than all the world besides it is still the same i still love him better than all the world how then can i give you any hope
8578,5867-48852-0036.flac," oh, yes! mary told me, i'm so glad of it. i always liked dr. cross very much. i've not congratulated her because i didn't know whether it was a secret. but cross was there last night, and if it is a secret, he didn't seem to be very careful about keeping it."
8579,5867-48852-0092.flac," he almost hated the earl for having brought him to this condition. a conquering hero indeed. how should he manage to sneak back among them all at the manor house, crestfallen and abject in his misery?"
8580,5867-48852-0070.flac," you will say nothing more of it. i have spoken to you more openly about this than i have ever done to anybody, even to mama, because i have wished to make you understand my feelings."
8581,5867-48852-0044.flac, and she felt moreover that john was entitled to an opportunity of pleading his own cause.
8582,5867-48852-0046.flac," they continued for some time to talk of crafts and his marriage, and when that subject was finished, they discussed their own probable, or as it seemed now improbable, removal to guest-wik. it's going too far, mama, said lily."
8583,5867-48852-0016.flac," at any rate, i have a right to tell her now. when he reached allington, he did not go in through the village and up to the front of the small house by the cross street, but turned by the church gate and passed over the squires' terrace."
8584,5867-48852-0067.flac," i wish it could be otherwise. i wish it could be otherwise if you can give him any hope. mama! tell me that i may come again in a year, you pleaded. i cannot tell you so. you may not come again, not in this way."
8585,5867-48852-0072.flac," i am not blaming him, remember? these things are different with the man. she had not dropped his hand, and as she made her last speech with sitting in her old chair with her eyes fixed upon the ground."
8586,5867-48852-0078.flac," but now the attempt had been made, and words had been forced from lily's lips, the speaking of which would never be forgotten by herself. i knew that it would be so,"" said john. ah, yes."
8587,5867-48852-0089.flac," and laughed inwardly as he remembered the figure of rafferty bringing in the night's jews. he had gone some half-mile upon his way before he ventured to stand still, and tell himself that he had failed in the great object of his life. yes."
8588,5867-48852-0056.flac," i wonder whether you would come as far as that with me. as the request was made, mrs. dale looked at her daughter almost be seated. ""'do,' praydew,' said he. ""'it is a beautiful day for walking.'"
8589,5867-48852-0011.flac," he had last seen her on the lawn behind the small house, just at that time when her passion for crossbeam was at the strongest. ames had gone thither impelled by a foolish desire to declare to her his hopeless love."
8590,5867-48852-0033.flac," that would be very troublesome. is lily with you, mrs. dale? yes, she is in the parlour. come and see her. so we followed mrs. dale through the hall, and found himself in the presence of his love."
8591,5867-48852-0079.flac," you know it because your heart understands my heart, and you will not be angry with me and say naughty, cruel words as you did once before. we will think of each other, john, and pray for each other, and we'll always love one another."
8592,5867-48852-0059.flac," oh, yes, and then i should have to go again with you, but john really, i don't wish to walk today. whereupon john ames again put down his hat. lily said he, and then he stopped. mrs. dale walked away to the window."
8593,5867-48852-0008.flac, there's nothing sets them against the man like being sheepish. how the earl knew so much.
8594,5867-48852-0105.flac," he had hardly finished and was still looking at the chips as they were being carried away by the stream. when a gentle step came close up to him and turning round, he saw that lady julia was on the bridge. she was close to him."
8595,5867-48852-0063.flac," if you are kind to me, you will let that be enough. but you are so unkind to me. no, no. oh, i would wish to be so kind to you. john here, take my hand. it is a hand of a friend who loves you and will always love you."
8596,5867-48852-0004.flac," but this he declined, and taking himself away hit himself about the place for the next hour and a half. during this time he considered much whether it would be better for him to ride or walk. if she should give him any hope,"
8597,5867-48852-0091.flac," and rebuked himself as having been not only foolish but ungenerous. his friend the earl had been warned in his waggish way to call him the conquering hero, and had so talked him out of his common sense as to have made him almost think that he would be successful in his suit."
8598,5867-48852-0058.flac," i think i am almost tired and i'd rather not go out. it would do you good,"" said mrs. dale. i don't want to be done good to mama. besides, i should have to come back by myself. i'll come back with you,"" said johnny."
8599,5867-48852-0096.flac," he crossed the road at the end of the squires' property where the parish of allington divides itself from that of abbott's guest, in which the earlshouse stands, and made his way back along the cops, which skirted the field, in which they had encountered the bull."
8600,5867-48852-0109.flac," and john, i can understand her feeling now, and indeed i thought all through that you were asking her too soon, but the time may yet come when she will think better of your wishes. no, no, never. i begin to know her now."
8601,5867-48852-0093.flac," everybody knew the errand on which he had gone, and everybody must know of his failure. how could he have been such a fool as to undertake such a task under the eyes of so many lookers on?"
8602,5867-48852-0082.flac," and i will love you now. then she put up her lips and kissed his face. and so will i love you, said lily, giving him her hand again."
8603,5867-48852-0060.flac," lily, i have come over here on purpose to speak to you. indeed, i have come down from london only that i might see you. have you, john? yes, i have. you know well all that i have got to tell you."
8604,5867-48852-0020.flac," all they said it. i hated them all. i did indeed, mr. john."
8605,5867-48852-0085.flac," and they mean to be good and natured, and to give me another. very shortly after that lily went away by herself, and sat alone for hours, and when she joined her mother again at tea-time, nothing further was said of john ains' visit."
8606,5867-48852-0064.flac," dear john, i will do anything. everything for you but that. there is only one thing said he, still holding her by the hand, but with his face turned from her. nay, do not say so."
8607,5867-48852-0100.flac," there he stopped, and stood a while with his broad hands spread over the letters which he had cut in those early days, so as to hide them from his sight. what an ass i have been. always and ever, he said to himself."
8608,5867-48852-0057.flac," the path proposed lay right across the field into which lily had taken crosby when she made her offer to let him off from his engagement. could it be possible that she should ever walk there again with another lover? no, john, she said. not today."
8609,5867-48852-0005.flac," he could ride back triumphant as a field marshal, then the horse would be delightful to him. but if she should give him no hope, if it should be his destiny to be rejected utterly on that morning, then the horse would be terribly in the way of his sorrow."
8610,5867-48852-0076.flac," or had attempted to make so clear an exposition of her own feelings. i should be disgraced in my own eyes if i admitted the love of another man. they were terrible words, but very easy to be understood."
8611,5867-48852-0015.flac," he had been ignominously thrashed. but what good would all this be of his image were still dear to lily's heart? i told her that i loved her then, he said to himself, though i had no right to do so."
8612,5867-48852-0028.flac," in this frame of mine he slowly made his way up across the lawn. ""'my dear, there is john ames,'' said mrs. dale, who had first seen him from the parlor window. don't go, mama.'"
8613,5867-48852-0003.flac," or else, as was more possible, bell avoided the meeting. no opportunity for such an interview offered itself, though he hung about the drawing-room all the morning. you had better wait for lunch and now, lady julia said to him about twelve."
8614,5867-48852-0032.flac," ames was so intent on his own purpose and so fully occupied with the difficulty of the task before him, that he could hardly receive mrs. dale's tidings with all the interest which they deserved. unpack them all again, he said."
8615,5867-48852-0002.flac," but the squire preferred walking, and in this way they were disposed of soon after breakfast. john had it in his mind to get bell to himself for half an hour and hold a conference with her. but it either happened that lady julia was too keen in her duties as a hostess."
8616,5867-48852-0077.flac," mrs. dale had felt from the first that ames was coming too soon, that the earl and the squire together were making an effort to cure the wound too quickly after its inflection, that time should have been given to her girl to recover."
8617,5867-48852-0042.flac," and for the moment silenced him. ""'you think he would have a better career in london?' said lily, speaking under the influence of her superior presence of mind. she had certainly shown defective judgment in desiring her mother not to leave them alone."
8618,5867-48852-0019.flac," to be sure this way or that way or any way who so welcome, mr. john, i envy you. i envy you more than i envy any man. if i could have got him by the scruff of the neck, i'd have treated him just like any worm and i would indeed. he was worm and i'd be."
8619,5867-48852-0107.flac," do you mean to cut it out from your heart? never. i would if i could, but i never shall. keep to it as to a great treasure. it will be a joy to you in after years and not to sorrow."
8620,5867-48852-0014.flac," was it not singular that all the evil things which he, in his mind, had meditated for the man had fallen upon him? crosby had lost his love. he had so proved himself to be a villain, that his name might not be so much as mentioned."
8621,5867-48852-0023.flac," tell me, mr. john, did you give it him well when you got him? i heard you did. two black eyes in all his face, one mash of gore, and hopkins, who was by no means a young man, stiffly put himself into a fighting attitude."
8622,1098-133695-0072.flac," who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, in as much as there were several things in which she excelled."
8623,1098-133695-0044.flac, and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again. the sentiment of these reflections was very just.
8624,1098-133695-0012.flac," with whom she talked a great deal, and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large license to extravagance. her cousin used, as the phrase is, to chave her."
8625,1098-133695-0043.flac," a greek bus relief to stick over my chimney piece. the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and i'm told to walk in and admire. my poor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful."
8626,1098-133695-0080.flac, it's impossible i should wait for you. mrs. tushet answered.
8627,1098-133695-0033.flac," the father and son had been close companions, and the idea of being left alone with a remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always intacidly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business."
8628,1098-133695-0024.flac, and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff.
8629,1098-133695-0013.flac," he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred."
8630,1098-133695-0019.flac, and enter the private apartments. it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place. she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order. it was but half hospitality to let her remain outside.
8631,1098-133695-0089.flac," isabel considered, i'm not vexed, but i'm surprised. and a good deal mystified. wasn't it proper i should remain in the drawing room? not in the least, young girls here in decent houses."
8632,1098-133695-0081.flac," ralph will like my candle, isabelle galey engaged. i'll light your candle. do let me light your candle, miss archer."
8633,1098-133695-0070.flac," cried lord walberton, still with his sonorous myrth. my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rose so well,"" said ralph. she does everything well. she touches nothing that she doesn't adorn."
8634,1098-133695-0038.flac," he wondered whether he were harboring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany, but he judged that on the whole he was not. after he had known her for a week, he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure."
8635,1098-133695-0046.flac," but she needed the knowing, and his attitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical, was not judicial. he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly."
8636,1098-133695-0008.flac," she asked of her aunt, when you criticize everything here, you should have a point of view. yours doesn't seem to be american. you thought everything over there so disagreeable. when i criticize, i have mine. it's thoroughly american."
8637,1098-133695-0006.flac," isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins, not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her, her aunt might make better use of her sharpness."
8638,1098-133695-0007.flac," she was very critical herself. it was incidental to her age, her sex, and her nationality, but she was very sentimental as well. and there was something in mrs. tuchette's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing. now what is your point of view?"
8639,1098-133695-0086.flac, mrs. tuchette gave a little look of despair and sat down again.
8640,1098-133695-0088.flac," nodded goodnight and withdrew, accompanied by her aunt. for himself he was annoyed at his mother, though he thought she was right. above stairs the two ladies separated at mrs. tuchette's door. isabel had said nothing on her way up."
8641,1098-133695-0040.flac," which he had always greatly admired. if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order. a caricor like that, he said to himself."
8642,1098-133695-0082.flac, only i beg it shall not be before midnight.
8643,1098-133695-0001.flac," her gaudy uncle received very little company and mrs. tushet, not having cultivated the relations with her husband's neighbors, was not warranted in expecting visits from them. she had, however, a peculiar taste. she liked to receive cards."
8644,1098-133695-0005.flac, isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt.
8645,1098-133695-0061.flac," had been that she should see a great many people. when ralph said to her as he had done several times, i wonder you find this indurable. you ought to see some of the neighbors and some of our friends."
8646,1098-133695-0075.flac," the first impression he had made on her had had wait, but at the end of an evening spent in his society, she scarce fell short of seeing him, though quite without lyridity, as a hero of romance."
8647,1098-133695-0068.flac," the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well. but i needn't ask that, he said, since you've been handling the oars. i've been rowing a little, isabelle answered, but how should you know it?"
8648,1098-133695-0026.flac," i don't know what's the matter with you. she observed to him once, but i suspect you're a great humbug."" that's your privilege. ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed. i don't know what you care for."
8649,1098-133695-0074.flac," he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow. during this period, he addressed many of his remarks to isabel, who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace. she found herself liking him extremely."
8650,1098-133695-0031.flac," the old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with. just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subdefuge of the enemy."
8651,1098-133695-0059.flac," the place itself was sovereign. her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather, and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered. her idea of cousins having tended to gloom."
8652,1098-133695-0073.flac," had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof. lord warburton not only spent the night at garden court, but he was persuaded to remain over the second day, and when the second day was ended,"
8653,1098-133695-0029.flac," at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him, her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for."
8654,1098-133695-0066.flac," oh no, they're not all like him."
8655,1098-133695-0050.flac," they took a boat on the river. the dear little river as isabel called it, where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape, or drove over the country in a faten, a low capacious thick-wield faten,"
8656,1098-133695-0071.flac," it makes one want to be touched, miss archer. lord walperton declared."
8657,1098-133695-0023.flac," she found herself able to defer from him on a variety of points. in fact, the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pair."
8658,1098-133695-0058.flac," he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense, and she had thought of him several times. she had hoped she should see him again, hoped too that she should see a few others. garden court was not dull."
8659,1098-133695-0000.flac," as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it. but in fact, the british public remained for the present, profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer, whose fortune had dropped her, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in england."
8660,1098-133695-0035.flac," but without the encouragement of his father's society, he should barely have patience to await his own turn. he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother. it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets."
8661,1098-133695-0032.flac," who was waiting to take him off his guard. if the manoeuvre should succeed, there would be little hope of any great resistance. ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him, that his own name would be the first grimly called."
8662,1098-133695-0083.flac, and transfer them coldly to her niece.
8663,1098-133695-0085.flac," i must take it as i find it. can't i stay with my own cousin, as a bell-enquired? i'm not aware that lord wardwarden is your cousin. perhaps i had better go to bed, the visitor suggested. that will arrange it."
8664,1098-133695-0054.flac," but the two for the most parts at silent, the old man with his head back and his eyes closed. his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity, with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles."
8665,1098-133695-0025.flac," if her good humor flagged at moments, it was not because she thought herself ill-used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph. it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said."
8666,1098-133695-0045.flac, his cousin was a very brilliant girl.
8667,1098-133695-0064.flac, isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens. it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary. she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases.
8668,1098-133695-0041.flac, a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature. it's finer than the finest work of art than a greek bass relief.
8669,1098-133695-0052.flac," full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find. past cottages thatched and timbered, past ale houses lattice and sanded, past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks,"
8670,1098-133695-0053.flac," between hedgerows made thick by midsummer. when they reached home, they usually found tea had been served on the lawn."
8671,1098-133695-0036.flac," he bethought himself, of course, that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound. he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy."
8672,1098-133695-0028.flac," even that, i should be very glad. oh, well, i should hope so. the young man exclaimed. isabelle might have believed it, and not have been far from the truth. he thought a great deal about her. she was constantly present to his mind."
8673,1098-133695-0027.flac," i don't think you care for anything. you don't really care for england when you praise it. you don't care for america even when you pretend to abuse it. i care for nothing but you do a cousin,"" said ralph. if i could believe that..."
8674,1098-133695-0067.flac," said isabel, because i'm sure he's nice."
8675,1098-133695-0022.flac," she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her, she would give him plenty of occupation. she defended england against his mother, but when ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up."
8676,1098-133695-0017.flac," it keeps the sounds of the worlds from reaching the private apartments, and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within."
8677,1098-133695-0065.flac," well now, there's a specimen. he said to her as they walked up from the riverside as he recognized lord warburton. a specimen of what? ask the girl. a specimen of an english gentleman. do you mean they're all like him?"
8678,1098-133695-0056.flac," of which even at a distance the desultery character was appreciable, was..."
8679,1098-133695-0049.flac," a pastime for which the weather remained favorable, with a persistency not allowed for in isabel's somewhat legubrious provision of the climate. and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness,"
8680,1098-133695-0084.flac," you're not at your blessed albany, my dear. isabel rose blushing. i wish i were,"" she said. oh, i say, mother."" ralph broke out."
8681,1098-133695-0009.flac," there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them. you may say that doesn't make them very numerous. american? never in the world that's shockingly narrow. my point of view, thank god, is personal."
8682,1098-133695-0090.flac," don't sit alone with the gentleman late at night. you were very right to tell me then,"" said isabelle. i don't understand it, but i'm very glad to know it. i shall always tell you,"" her aunt answered. whenever i see you taking what seems to me, too much liberty."
8683,1098-133695-0020.flac," it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self-defense, for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched. he drew a caricature of her."
8684,1098-133695-0051.flac," but which he had now ceased to enjoy. isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing, was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways."
8685,1098-133695-0021.flac, in the folds of the national banner. isabelle's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow-minded. what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so. but she never left.
8686,1098-133695-0042.flac," then a gothic cathedral. it's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it. i had never been more blue, more bored than for a week before she came. i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen."
8687,1098-133695-0063.flac," little, however, for the present had come of his offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out, it was because he found the labor of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help."
8688,1098-133695-0004.flac," but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them, and that her failure, really very gratuitous, to make herself important in the neighborhood, had not much to do with the acrimony of her illusions to her husband's adopted country."
8689,1098-133695-0055.flac," one day, however, a visitor had arrived. the two young persons, after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation."
8690,1098-133695-0048.flac," and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor. so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph, duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed. he was not a great walker, but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin."
8691,1098-133695-0069.flac," ""'oh, i know he doesn't row. he's too lazy,' said his lordship, indicating ralph to shed with a laugh. he has a good excuse for his laziness, isabelle rejoined, lowering her voice a little. ah, he has a good excuse for everything.'"
8692,1098-133695-0091.flac," yes, i think i'm very fond of them, but i always want to know the things one shouldn't do. so is to do them, ask her aunt."
8693,1098-133695-0010.flac," isabelle thought this a better answer than she admitted. it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not have sounded well for her to say so."
8694,1098-133695-0016.flac," he's adopted and his native country. he's charming newfound cousin. i keep a band of music in my anti-room. he said, once to her, it has orders to play without stopping. it renders me two excellent services."
8695,1098-133695-0077.flac," that an incident had occurred, which might have seemed to put her good humor to the test."
8696,1098-133695-0076.flac," with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities. it's very nice to know too such charming people as those,"" she said, meaning by those her cousin and her cousin's friend. it must be added moreover"
8697,1098-133695-0060.flac," her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view. but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature, and that her foremost hope in coming abroad"
8698,1098-133695-0039.flac," lord warburton had been right about her. she was a really interesting little figure. ralph wondered how their neighbor had found it out so soon, and then he said it was only another proof of his friends' high abilities."
8699,1098-133695-0002.flac," for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish, but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whiteened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard. she flattered herself that she was a very just woman."
8700,1098-133695-0079.flac," the occasion wore to her sense a festive character, and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early. so without further thought, she replied very simply, need i go dear aunt, i'll come up in half an hour."
8701,1098-133695-0047.flac," isabelle's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own. whenever she executes them, said ralph, may i be there to see? it devolved upon him, of course, to do the honors of the place."
8702,1098-133695-0034.flac," at the prospect of losing his great motive, ralph lost indeed his one inspiration."
8703,1098-133695-0078.flac," but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party. she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then rising, observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentleman good night. isabel had, as yet no desire to go to bed,"
8704,1098-133695-0018.flac, the liveliest waltzes seem to float upon the air. isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling.
8705,1098-133695-0011.flac, would savor of immodesty even of arrogance.
8706,1098-133695-0003.flac," and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing. she had played no social part as mistress of garden court, and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country, a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings."
8707,1098-133695-0030.flac," poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy. his outlook habitually somber, lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud."
8708,1098-133695-0037.flac," which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first. but of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophisticated son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements he enjoyed,"
8709,1098-133695-0015.flac," his useless life, his fantastic mother."
8710,1098-133695-0087.flac, ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick. he had been watching her. it had seemed to him her temper was involved. an accident that might be interesting. but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little.
8711,1098-133695-0014.flac, of laughing at all things beginning with himself. such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centered wholly upon his father. for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son. this gentleman's weak lungs
8712,1098-133695-0057.flac," he had driven over from his own place with a portman too, and had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a dinner and a lodging. isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him."
8713,1098-133695-0062.flac," though you would never suppose it. when he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society, she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray."
8714,3857-182317-0014.flac," but no matter how harmless we treat them as outlaws, and those of us who are specially well brought up shoot them for fun. some might be our friends. we don't wish it. we keep them all terrorized."
8715,3857-182317-0007.flac," he was plastic, too. he had learned to eat many foods and endure many climates. once some say this race explored the globe. their bones are found everywhere in south america even."
8716,3857-182317-0033.flac," in addition to these, a race, to be great, needs some hunger, some itch, to spur it up the hard path we'd lately have learned to call evolution. the love of toil in the ants and of craft and cats are examples."
8717,3857-182317-0026.flac," torn between those two voices, wailing loudly at night by a river in his puzzled distress. my poor, far off, brother!"
8718,3857-182317-0006.flac," and well should the elephant know it. he had the best chance of all. wise are even then the lion, where the wisest of apes, his wisdom furthermore was benign where theirs was sinister. consider his dignity, his poise and skill."
8719,3857-182317-0030.flac," we attain no power over nature till we learn natural laws, and our lordship depends on the adroitness with which we learn and conform. adroitness, however, is merely an ability to win."
8720,3857-182317-0013.flac," all species must surrender unconditionally. those are our terms. and come and live in barns alongside us, or honest as parasites. the creatures that want to live a life of their own, we call wild. if wild."
8721,3857-182317-0011.flac," just as ants are too energetic and cats too shrewd for their own highest good, so the elephants suffer from too much patience. their exhibitions of it may seem superb. such power and such restraint combined are noble."
8722,3857-182317-0028.flac," some quenchless desire to urge them on and on, and also adaptability of a thousand kinds to their environment. the rhinocera's cares little for adaptability. he slogs through the world. but we."
8723,3857-182317-0002.flac," one must grant their vassals, not rulers. they are two parasitic, the one willing servant class of the world. and we have betrayed them by making undersymians of them."
8724,3857-182317-0022.flac," and all that while the contest for leadership blindly went on, without any species making use of this obvious aid, the lesson to be learned was simple. the reward was the rule of a planet, yet only one species are own."
8725,3857-182317-0001.flac," but they have lost their chance of kingship through worshiping us. the dog's finer qualities can't be praised too warmly. there is a purity about his devotion, which makes mere men feel speechless. but with all love for dogs,"
8726,3857-182317-0024.flac," instead of sticking to instinct. now, sticking to instinct has its disadvantages, but so has using reason. whichever faculty you use, the other atrophies, and partly deserts you. we are trying to use both."
8727,3857-182317-0005.flac," and grossness delays one's achievement. it takes so much time. the snake, too, though wise, has a way of eating himself into stupors. if super-snakemen had had banquets, they would have been too vast to describe."
8728,3857-182317-0032.flac," by some longing that pushes them forward in defeat and in darkness. all creatures wish to live, and to perpetuate their species, of course. but those two wishes alone evidently do not carry any race far."
8729,3857-182317-0015.flac," when one of us conquering monkey-man enters the woods, most animals that sent him slink away, or race off in a panic. it is not that we have planned this deliberately, but they know what we're like. race by race, they have been slaughtered."
8730,3857-182317-0027.flac, and thereafter achieve a high civilization. but that wasn't the problem. the real problem
8731,3857-182317-0020.flac," when an elephant plucks off a branch and switches his flanks and thus keeps away insects, he is using a tool. but he does it only by a vague and haphazard association of ideas. if he once became a conscious user of tools,"
8732,3857-182317-0018.flac," the elephant is stupid when it comes to learning how to use tools. so are all other species, except our own. isn't it strange? a tool, in the most primitive sense, is any object lying around?"
8733,3857-182317-0004.flac," dogs have more love than integrity. they've been true to us, yes, but they haven't been true to themselves. pigs! the pig is remarkably intelligent and brave, but he's gross."
8734,3857-182317-0009.flac," and not narrow, not self-absorbed, for they seemed interested in everything. what was it then that put them out of the race? could it have been a quite natural belief that they had already won? and when they saw that they hadn't?"
8735,3857-182317-0008.flac," so the elephant's columbus may have found some road here before hours. their cosmopolitan's, these swav and well-bred beings, they have rich emotional nature, long memories, loyalty. they are steady and sure."
8736,3857-182317-0003.flac," loving us, they let us stop their developing in tune with their natures, and they've patiently tried ever since to adopt ways of ours. they have done it, too. but of course they can't get far. it's not their own road."
8737,3857-182317-0000.flac," some had over-trustful characters like the seals, or exploitable characters like cows and chickens and sheep. such creatures sentenced themselves to be captives by their lack of ambition. dogs? they had more spirit."
8738,3857-182317-0012.flac, more live and let live in allowing other species to stay here. our way is to kill good and bad male and female and babies till the few last survivors lie hidden away from our guns.
8739,3857-182317-0019.flac," that can obviously be used as an instrument for this or that purpose. many creatures use objects as materials, as birds use twigs for nests. but the step that no animal takes is learning freely to use things as instruments."
8740,3857-182317-0029.flac," we are experts. adaptability is what we depend on. we talk of our mastery of nature, which sounds very grand. but the fact is, we respectfully adapt ourselves first to her ways."
8741,3857-182317-0023.flac," has ever had that much brains. it makes you wonder what other obvious lessons may still be unlearned. it is not necessarily stupid, however, to fail to use tools. to use tools involves using reason."
8742,3857-182317-0010.flac," and that the monkey men were getting ahead, were they too great-minded and decent to exterminate their puny rivals? it may have been their tolerance and patience that betrayed them. they wait too long before they resent an imposition or insult,"
8743,3857-182317-0016.flac," soon all will be gone. we give neither freedom nor life-room to those we defeat. if we had been as strong as the elephants, we might have been kinder. when great power comes naturally to people,"
8744,3857-182317-0017.flac," it is used more urbanly. we use it as parvenous do, because that's what we are. the elephant, being born to it, is easygoing, confident, tolerant. he would have been a more humane king."
8745,3857-182317-0021.flac," he would of course go much further. we ourselves, who are so good at it now, were slow enough in beginning, think of the long epochs that passed before it entered our heads."
8746,3857-182317-0025.flac," but we still don't know which has the more value. a sudden vision comes to me of one of the first faraway ape men who tried to use reason instead of instinct as a guide for his conduct. i imagine him, perched in his tree."
8747,3857-182317-0031.flac," back of it, there must be some spur to make us use our adroitness. why don't we all die or give up when we're sick of this world? because the love of life is reinforced, and most energized beings"
8748,3857-180923-0027.flac, there were refugees from the revolutionary uprisings in europe of 1848. there were some who had served under compulsion in the armies of the south. there were men whose obviously fictitious names concealed stories which could be guessed to be extraordinary.
8749,3857-180923-0029.flac," and every town among us has known some of them ever since among its leading figures, while some in quarters far distant have also attained to honors and responsibilities as the record show."
8750,3857-180923-0028.flac," there were names which have been for years among the best known and most honored in this state, and there were those of outcasts and wrecks. a large part of these men came back after their service ended to resume the peaceful life of citizenship."
8751,3857-180923-0005.flac," as the burden of the baccalaureate sermon so frequently testifies, is consigned to a special place of responsibility in life because of his training. these men surely earned one of special honor by reason of theirs, which was, too."
8752,3857-180923-0018.flac," corporal edward c. hobson, a graduate of trinity in 1864, was killed at cedar creek. sergeant garwood r. merwin, who had been a member of the class of 1864 at yale,"
8753,3857-180923-0023.flac," as a whole, the regiment was a body thoroughly representative not only of the army of which it was a fraction, an army as has been often said unlike any other the world has known, but also of the population from which it was drawn."
8754,3857-180923-0007.flac," a number of the officers and men were college graduates when they enlisted, and others gained degrees after the war ended. the list which follows is, however, necessarily incomplete. in fact, an absolutely correct list is no doubt hopelessly impossible."
8755,3857-180923-0016.flac," studied after the war at the berkeley divinity school, and has been for many years rector of st. john's church in bridgeport. lieutenant and brevet captain louis w. munger"
8756,3857-180923-0006.flac," not like the other, preparation alone, but also fulfillment. the realization of how typical it all was of that generation and that time brings the clearest understanding of the real scope of the civil war."
8757,3857-180923-0012.flac, captain and brevitt major was a graduate of williams in the class of 1857. he was pastor of the congregational church at east canaan when the regiment was organized and was one of its recruiting officers. adjutant theodore f. vale
8758,3857-180923-0020.flac," there are not a few other names upon the roles of the regiment, which upon more thorough investigation that has been possible in the present case would certainly be added to the list."
8759,3857-180923-0003.flac," for then the hundreds of thousands of their contemporaries who devoted themselves to the same service is not to be believed. yet to have passed through such experiences as have been recounted, which became for them for a time the commonplaces of everyday life,"
8760,3857-180923-0008.flac," and was enlisted as captain of a company which he had been active in recruiting. lieutenant colonel nathaniel smith of woodbury entered the yale law school in the class of 1853, but did not graduate."
8761,3857-180923-0014.flac, and received a degree from trinity in 1855. surgeon henry plum and assistant surgeons robert g. hazard and john w. lawton were all graduates of the yale medical school in the classes of 1861.
8762,3857-180923-0022.flac," memorable among these meetings was the one held on october 21, 1896. the occasion being the dedication of the regiment's monument in the national cemetery at arlington."
8763,3857-180923-0010.flac," came back from the war, having lost an arm at cedar creek, to take a course in the law school at harvard, and yale made him a master of arts in 1889. his prominence for many years in public life and his judge in the highest courts in the state is well known."
8764,3857-180923-0026.flac, the records kept by the association referred to furnished suggestive revelations as to the various elements that composed it. the names of men of every sort and kind are found upon the roles. there were veterans of the mexican war.
8765,3857-180923-0025.flac," though the large addition to its numbers, which the increase in size necessitated made it perhaps somewhat less homogeneous than at first, it did not greatly alter its essential characteristics."
8766,3857-180923-0015.flac, and after the war was for some years rector of st. john's church in salisbury. he was later connected with the church college in missouri where he died in 1898.
8767,3857-180923-0004.flac," is enough to place them apart from ordinary men in the eyes of our peace-knowing generation. in fact, to have passed the tests of so fierce a course of education gives them a title to a place thus apart. the university man of today"
8768,3857-180923-0000.flac," the preceding pages have outlined the career of the second connecticut heavy artillery, and have narrated some of the more memorable events of its history. enough has been told of what it did to furnish grounds for deducing what it was."
8769,3857-180923-0017.flac," sargent theodore c. glasier was a graduate of trinity in the class of 1860, and was a tutor there when he enlisted. he was later made colonel of a colored regiment, and served with credit in that capacity."
8770,3857-180923-0002.flac," made up the organization whose not uneventful existence has been described. that they were better men or worse, braver men, or more patriotic, than their descendants and successors would prove under similar conditions,"
8771,3857-180923-0013.flac," the historian of the regiment was a student before the war at union college, but did not graduate. captain george s. williams, as new milford, was a member of the class of 1852 at yale for a time,"
8772,3857-180923-0011.flac," at the time of his death in 1897, he was a lecturer in the yale law school and member of the supreme court of errors."
8773,3857-180923-0001.flac," but to deal with the regiment on the personal side is hardly possible within the limits of such a sketch as this, though it is a matter that cannot be entirely passed by."
8774,3857-180923-0009.flac," el health forced him to relinquish his commission early in 1864, and until his death in 1877 he was a leading citizen of the county. judge augustus h. fenn, major and brevitt colonel,"
8775,3857-180923-0021.flac," a complete history of the organization would also give a large place to the association of its veterans formed shortly after the war, whose frequent gatherings have more than a superficial likeness to the reunions of college classes."
8776,3857-180923-0024.flac," it was made up of men of almost all conditions of life and of widely different ages, though naturally with young men in a large majority. of mechanics from the housatonic and nagatuck valleys and farmers' boys from the hills, of men of education and men of none."
8777,3857-180923-0019.flac," colonel mckenzie graduated at west point in 1862, but he was never a resident of the county or of connecticut, and his only connection with either was through his commission from governor buckingham."
8778,3857-182315-0029.flac," no derision of eugenics, no thieves, perhaps no crime at all. answer good citizens. they place group interests first. but they carry it so far they have few or no political rights."
8779,3857-182315-0016.flac," there are also queer limitations. 3. in those distant and visible epochs, before men existed, before even the proud, missing links strutted around through the woods."
8780,3857-182315-0030.flac," an ant doesn't have the vote, apparently. he just has his duties. this quality may have something to do with their having group's wars. the egotism of their individual spirits is a loud scant expression."
8781,3857-182315-0044.flac," it is the servant of instinct. it, with therefore, have told the ants that incessant toil was useful and good. toil has brought you up from the ruck of things."" reason would have possibly said."
8782,3857-182315-0012.flac," if a god or some principle of growth had gone that way to work with us, he or it might have molded us in much more splendid forms. but considering our simian descent, it is done very well."
8783,3857-182315-0024.flac," still, those frowsy, unlovely hordes of apes and monkeys were so completely lacking in signs of kingship. they were so flighty too in their ways, and had so little purpose, and so much love for absurd and idle chatter."
8784,3857-182315-0020.flac," familiar with the ways of evolution elsewhere in the universe, we naturally should have wondered what course it would take on this earth. even in this out of the way corner of the cosmos, we might have reflected, and on this tiny star,"
8785,3857-182315-0036.flac," regressively so. their ways are more fixed than those of the old egyptians, and their industry is painful to think of. it's hyper-chinese. but we must remember this is a simian comment."
8786,3857-182315-0011.flac," what could you expect? 2. if we had been made directly from clay, the way it says in the bible, and had therefore inherited no intermediate characteristics,"
8787,3857-182315-0022.flac, and how great a development could they attain to thereafter.
8788,3857-182315-0032.flac," i wish i could truly say, inhuman. but conversely, answer absolutely unselfish within the community. they are skillful, ingenious. their nests and buildings are relatively larger than man's."
8789,3857-182315-0019.flac," and kept us in cages, or show us for sport in the forest while they ruled the world. so potter and i, developing this train of thought, began to imagine we had lived many ages ago, and somehow or other had a lighted here from some older planet."
8790,3857-182315-0026.flac, the bees or the ants might have seemed to us more promising. their smallness of size was not necessarily too much of a handicap. they could have made poison their weapon for the subjugation of rivals.
8791,3857-182315-0004.flac," sunday afternoon crowds. they were not going anywhere. they were just strolling up and down, staring at each other, and talking. there were thousands and thousands of them."
8792,3857-182315-0008.flac," and yet at other times i too feel like a spectator, an alien. but even then i had never felt so alien or despairing as potter. let's remember, i said, it's a simian civilization."
8793,3857-182315-0001.flac," i take a jealous pride in my simian ancestry. i like to think that i was once a magnificent, hairy fellow, living in the trees, and that my frame has come down through geological time via sea-jelly and worms."
8794,3857-182315-0006.flac, are any other beings ever found in such masses but vermin? ameless staring. they could mind it. look at them.
8795,3857-182315-0038.flac," and instead of merely struggling with nature for it, they also fight other ants. the custom of plunder seems to be a part of most of their wars. this has gone on for ages among them and continues today."
8796,3857-182315-0005.flac," i turned and asked, what about them? i wasn't sure whether he had an idea or a headache. other creatures don't do it, he replied, with a discouraged expression."
8797,3857-182315-0013.flac," the only people who are disappointed in us are those who still believe that clay story, or who unconsciously still let it color their thinking. there certainly seems to be a power at work in the world."
8798,3857-182315-0040.flac, but that would not help for long unless they could abolish the love of it. and seemed to care even more for property than we do ourselves. we met her in klein to ease up a little when we have all we need.
8799,3857-182315-0018.flac," certain groups sought the headship. many strange forgotten dynasties rose, met defiance and fell. in the end, it was our ancestors who won and became simeon kings and bequeathed a whole planet to us."
8800,3857-182315-0042.flac," conceivably, they might have developed inquiring minds, but this would have run against their strongest instincts. the ant is knowing and wise, but he doesn't know enough to take a vacation."
8801,3857-182315-0033.flac," the scientists speak of their paved streets, vaulted halls, their hundreds of different domesticated animals, their pluck and intelligence, their individual initiative, their chest and industrious lives."
8802,3857-182315-0007.flac, i could get no sense whatever of individual worth or value in men as a race when i see them like this. it makes one almost despair of civilization. i thought this over for a while.
8803,3857-182315-0010.flac," eagles, for instance, instead of broadly speaking from ape-like or monkey-ish beings. being of simeon's stock, we had simeon traits. our development naturally bore the marks of our origin."
8804,3857-182315-0034.flac," darwin said the ants' brain was one of the most marvelous atoms in the world, perhaps more so than the brain of man. yes, of present-day man, who for thousands and thousands of years has had so much more chance to develop his brain."
8805,3857-182315-0027.flac, and in these orderly insects there are obviously a capacity for labor and cooperative labor at that which could carry them far. we all know that they have a mark's genius. great gifts of their own.
8806,3857-182315-0014.flac," by virtue of which every living thing grows and develops. and it tends toward splendor. seeds become trees, and weak little nations grow great. but the push or the force that is doing this, the yeast as it were."
8807,3857-182315-0021.flac," it may be of interest to consider the trend of events. we should have tried to appraise the different species as they wandered around, each with its own set of good and bad characteristics, which group we'd have wondered would ever contrive to rule all the rest."
8808,3857-182315-0031.flac," so the egotism of the groups is extremely ferocious and active. is this one of the reasons why ants fight so much? we have seen the same phenomenon occur in certain nations of men, and the ants commit atrocities in and after their battles that are"
8809,3857-182315-0043.flac," would they have been able therewith to rule their instincts, or to stop work long enough to examine themselves, or the universe, or to dream of any noble development? probably not. reason is seldom or never the ruler."
8810,3857-182315-0037.flac," the instincts of the species that you and i belong to are of an opposite kind, and that makes it hard for us to judge ants fairly. but we in the ants are alike in one matter. the strong love of property."
8811,3857-182315-0015.flac," has to work in and on certain definite kinds of material. because this yeast is in us, there may be great and undreamed of possibilities awaiting mankind. but because of our line of descent,"
8812,3857-182315-0023.flac," we might first have considered the lemurs or apes. they had hands. esthetically viewed, the porcimians were simply grotesque, but travelers who knew other planets might have known what beauty may spring from an uncouth beginning in this magic universe."
8813,3857-182315-0009.flac," potter was staring disgustedly at some vaudeville signboards. yes, i said, those, for example, are distinctively simian. why should you feel disappointment at something inevitable? and i went on to argue that it wasn't as though we were descended from"
8814,3857-182315-0025.flac," they are not easily left behind even after long stages, and they form a terrible obstacle to all high advancement."
8815,3857-182315-0041.flac, they can't bear to stop. they keep right on working. this means that ants do not contemplate. they heed nothing outside of their own little rounds. it is almost as though their fondness for labor has closed fast their minds.
8816,3857-182315-0035.flac," a thoughtful observer would have weighed all these excellent qualities. when we think of these creatures as little men, which is all wrong, of course, we see they have their faults. to our eyes they seem too orderly, for instance."
8817,3857-182315-0028.flac," in a civilization of super ants or bees, there would have been no problem of the hungry unemployed, no poverty, no unstable government, no riots, no strikes for short hours."
8818,3857-182315-0045.flac, it's by virtue of feverish toil that you have become what you are. being endlessly industrious is the best road for you to the heights.
8819,3857-182315-0000.flac," how i hate the man who talks about the brute creation with an ugly emphasis on brute. as for me, i am proud of my close kinship with other animals."
8820,3857-182315-0017.flac," little realizing how we his great grandsons would smile riley at him much as our own descendants may shutter at us, ages hence, the various animals were desperately competing for power. they couldn't, or didn't, live as equals."
8821,3857-182315-0039.flac," raids, ferocious combats, and loot are part of an ant's regular life. ant reformers, if there were any, might lay this to their property sense, and talk of abolishing property as a cure for the evil."
8822,3857-182315-0003.flac," last sunday, potter took me out driving along up a broadway, where those long rows of tall, new apartment houses were built a few years ago. it was a mild afternoon, and great crowds of people were out."
8823,3857-182315-0002.flac," and amphioxis, fish, dinosaurs, and apes. who would exchange these for the pallid couple in the garden of eden? wnp barbellian"
8824,6078-54007-0049.flac," i know not why it is,"" said he, but that story of yours, my friend, brings to my mind a story of a man whom i once knew, a great magician in his time, and a necromancer and a chemist and an alchemist."
8825,6078-54007-0040.flac," and all was as sweet and happy as a spring day. but at the end of that time the fiddler began to wonder what was to be seen in the castle. the queen was very fond of him, and was glad enough to show him all the fine things that were to be seen."
8826,6078-54007-0044.flac," and the spark of light at the far end, as though the sun were shining. he cocked his head to one side and listened. yes, said he. i think i hear the water rushing, but i am not sure. i will just go a little further in."
8827,6078-54007-0037.flac," and so she had come out into the garden for a bit of rest, and there she sat under the shade of an apple tree, fanning herself and crying, wind, swash, down fell the fiddler into the apple tree, and down fell a dozen apples,"
8828,6078-54007-0021.flac, everything the fiddler wanted came to his hand. he lived high and slept soft and warm and never knew what it was to want either more or less or great or small. and all of those three or four days he did nothing but enjoy himself.
8829,6078-54007-0046.flac," away through the fiddler like a bullet, and there was ill luck carrying him by the belt again. away they sped."
8830,6078-54007-0034.flac," by and by he managed to screw his head around and look up, and there it was, ill luck that had him. i thought so, said the fiddler, and then he gave over kicking. while on and on they flew over hill and valley, over moore and mountain."
8831,6078-54007-0050.flac," and a rhetorician, an astronomer, an astrologer, and a philosopher as well. tis a long list of exonancies said, oh, bid pie."
8832,6078-54007-0048.flac," or else i would have been a king if it had not been for ill luck. and that is the way we all of us talk. dr. fastus had sat all the while neither drinking ale nor smoking tobacco, but with his hands folded and in silence."
8833,6078-54007-0041.flac," you must not ask or wish to know. should you open that door, ill luck will be sure to overtake you."" poo said the fiddler. i don't care to know anyhow. and off they went hand in hand. yes."
8834,6078-54007-0045.flac," and listen, and so he entered and closed the door behind him. well, he went on and on until, pop! there he was out at the farther end, and before he knew what he was about, he had stepped out upon the seashore."
8835,6078-54007-0047.flac," until the finners had grew so dizzy that he had to shut his eyes. suddenly, ill luck let him drop, and down he fell, thump, bump, on the hard ground. then he opened his eyes and sat up."
8836,6078-54007-0036.flac," and all had been weeping and woe, though they were beginning now to pick up their smiles again. and this was the reason why. the king of that country had died, and no one was left behind him, but the queen."
8837,6078-54007-0025.flac," there, in a corner by the wall, was a great trap door of iron. the old man fitted the key to the lock and turned it. he lifted the door and then went down a steep flight of stone steps, and the fiddler followed close at his heels."
8838,6078-54007-0043.flac," why look, says he. it is just like the door at the rich men's house over yonder. i wonder if it is the same inside as outside. and he opened the door and peeped in. yes, there was the long passage."
8839,6078-54007-0020.flac," and so you shall live with me as long as i live, and after i am gone, everything that i have shall be yours."" the fitler did nothing but stare with open eyes and mouth, as though he would never shut either again."
8840,6078-54007-0038.flac," you fell from heaven, for i saw it with my eyes and heard it with my ears. i see how it is now. you were sent hither from heaven to be my husband, and my husband you shall be. you shall be king of this country. half and half with me as queen."
8841,6078-54007-0035.flac," until they came to another garden, and their ill luck led the fiddler drop. swash, down he fell into the top of an apple tree, and their he hung in the branches. it was the garden of a royal castle."
8842,6078-54007-0029.flac, perhaps i can see what is there without opening the door. so down he took the key and off he marched to the garden. he opened the trap door and went down the steep steps to the room below. there was the door at the end of the room.
8843,6078-54007-0022.flac," with might and main. but by and by he began to wonder where all the good things came from. then, before long, he felt a pestering the old man with questions about the matter. at first the old man put him off with short answers."
8844,6078-54007-0026.flac, down below it was as light as day. for in the center of the room hung a great lamp that shone with a bright light.
8845,6078-54007-0031.flac," he heard a sound like the waves beating on the shore. well, says he. this is the most curious thing i have seen for a long time. since i have come so far, i may as well see the end of it."""
8846,6078-54007-0042.flac," that was a very fine thing to say. but before an hour had gone by, the fiddlers had began to hum and buzz like a beehive. i don't believe,"" said he. there would be a grain of harm in my peeping inside that door all the same."
8847,6078-54007-0023.flac," but the fiddler was a master hand at finding out anything he wanted to know. he didn't and drummed, and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer. so, at last the old man said that he would show him the treasure house, where all his wealth came from."
8848,6078-54007-0033.flac," there he stood on the seashore, with the waves beating and dashing on the rocks. he stood looking and wondering to find himself in such a place. when all of a sudden, something came with a whizz and a rush and caught him by the belt, and away he flew like a bullet."
8849,6078-54007-0030.flac," but when he came to look, there was no keyhole to it."
8850,6078-54007-0027.flac," you must never open that door yonder at the back of the room. should you do so, ill luck will be sure to overtake you. oh no! the fiddler would never think of doing such a thing as opening the door."
8851,6078-54007-0032.flac," so he entered the passageway and closed the door behind him. he went on and on, and the spark of light kept growing larger and larger, and by and by pap! out he came at the other end of the passage. sure enough,"
8852,6078-54007-0039.flac," and she'll sit on a throne beside me. you can guess whether or not that was music to the fiddler's ears. so the princes were sent packing, and the fiddler was married to the queen, and reigned in that country. well, three or four days passed,"
8853,6078-54007-0051.flac," nay said st. george, everything must have a name. it hath no name said dr. fostas, but i shall give it a name, and it shall be…"
8854,6078-54007-0028.flac," and out into the sunlight again. it took a maybe an hour to count all the money and jewels he had brought up with them. after he had done that, he began to wonder what was inside of the little door at the back of the room. first he wondered."
8855,6078-54007-0024.flac," and at that, the fiddler was tickled beyond measure."
8856,6078-54007-0011.flac," and pop, out came ill- luck along with it. plague take the fiddler, say, i, listen, says ill- luck. it has been many a long day that i have been in that hazelnut, and you are the man that has let me out."
8857,6078-54007-0005.flac," even if it be through a keyhole. now, is that so? yes, as ill-uck it is. well, look now, friends, as st. nicholas."
8858,6078-54007-0009.flac," so, says st. nicholas, that's a piece of work well done. then he tossed the hazel nut under the roots of an oak tree nearby and went his way. and that is how the story begins. well."
8859,6078-54007-0006.flac," he asked, says ill-luck, i could indeed. i should like to see you, says st. nicholas, for then i should be of a mind to believe what people say of you. well, says ill-luck, i have not much time to be pottering and playing upon jack's fiddle, but to oblige an old friend."
8860,6078-54007-0014.flac," all built of white marble with a fountain in front, and peacock strutting about on the lawn. well, the fiddler smoothed down his hair and brushed his clothes a bit, and off he went to see what was to be seen at the grand house at the end of the garden."
8861,6078-54007-0017.flac," do not say that. sit down to the table and eat. and when i have told you all, you will say it was not ill- luck, but good luck that brought you. the fiddler had his own mind about that, but all the same, down he sat at the table."
8862,6078-54007-0007.flac, then what do you think saint nicholas did?
8863,6078-54007-0001.flac," for he had a notion to find out whether things were going on nowadays, as they one time did. by and by he came to a crossroad, and who should he see sitting there, but ill luck himself? ill luck's face was as gray as ashes."
8864,6078-54007-0016.flac," the table was spread with a feast that smelled so good that it brought tears to the fiddler's eyes and water to his mouth, and all the plates were of pure gold. the little old man sat alone, but another place was spread."
8865,6078-54007-0019.flac," and without wife or child. and this morning i said to myself that the first body that came to my house, i would take for a son or a daughter, as the case might be. you are the first."
8866,6078-54007-0010.flac," nobody met with ill luck, but one day, who should come traveling that way?"
8867,6078-54007-0013.flac," than away he flew to attend to other matters of greater need. when the fiddler had gathered his wits together, and himself to his feet, he saw that he lay in a beautiful garden of flowers and fruit trees and marble walks and whatnot."
8868,6078-54007-0002.flac, and his hair as white as snow.
8869,6078-54007-0018.flac," and fell to with knife and fork at the good things, as though he had not had a bite to eat for a week of sundays. i am the richest man in the world, says a little old man after a while. i'm glad to hear it, says the fiddler. you may well be, said the old man."
8870,6078-54007-0003.flac, and two great wings grew out of his shoulders. for he flies fast and comes quickly to those whom we visit. does ill luck.
8871,6078-54007-0008.flac," and no sooner had ill luck entered the nut, then he stuck the plug in the hole, and there was man's enemy."
8872,6078-54007-0012.flac," for once in a way, i will do a good turn to a poor human body, therewith and without giving the fiddler time to speak a word. il luck caught him up by the belt and whiz, away he flew like a bullet."
8873,6078-54007-0015.flac," he entered the door, and nobody said no to him. then he passed through one room after another, and each was finer than the one he left behind. many servants stood around, but they only bowed, and never asked whence he came."
8874,6078-54007-0004.flac," which he kept cracking and eating as he trudged along the road, and just then he came upon one with a wormhole in it. when he saw ill-luck it came into his head to do a good turn to poor, sorrowful man. good morning, ill-luck, says he."
8875,6078-54007-0000.flac, ill luck and the fiddler. once upon a time st. nicholas came down into the world to take a peep at the old place and see how things looked in the springtime. on he stepped along the road to the town where he used to live.
8876,6078-54013-0062.flac," for many a long day and never knew that a great treasure of silver and gold was hidden beneath it. until a few days ago, there came an angel."
8877,6078-54013-0040.flac," but the next morning before the dawning of the day, the traveling companion was stirring again."
8878,6078-54013-0024.flac," then, when all but they too were tight and fast asleep,"
8879,6078-54013-0051.flac," but suddenly, catching the widow's son by the collar, he lifted him and flung him into the black rushing water, splash, with the young man. and then away he went whirling over rocks and waterfalls. there cried the comrade."
8880,6078-54013-0056.flac," the garden and the torrent and all were gone, and nothing was left but a naked playing, covered over with the bones of those who had come that way before, seeking the fruit which the traveling servant had sought. it was a long time before the servant found his way back into the world again."
8881,6078-54013-0000.flac, once upon a time there was a servant who served a wise man.
8882,6078-54013-0079.flac," come friend, let us have it. stop a bit, said fortunatus. what is this story mostly about? it is said alibaba. about two men bit twix tung, there was."
8883,6078-54013-0070.flac," my wife and all my friends fell out with me, and we quarreled so that they all left me. but, though i knew it not at the time, your comrade was an angel, and took the ring away with him, and now i am as happy as i was sorrowful before."
8884,6078-54013-0031.flac," no matter for that said the traveling companion, we can go no father tonight, so you must let us in and hide us the best you may. and any went as he said with the servant at his heels."
8885,6078-54013-0053.flac," he found his tongue at last, and all that he had bottled up."
8886,6078-54013-0071.flac," rapp tap tap. he knocked at the door, and the wise man who had been his master opened to him."
8887,6078-54013-0045.flac," in this cottage lived a widow and her only son, and they also made the travelers welcome, and set before them a good supper and showed them to a clean bed. this time the traveling comrade did neither good nor ill to those of the house."
8888,6078-54013-0066.flac," there happened to be one of the households standing at the door, and he knew the servant as the companion of that one who had stolen the ruby ring. up he came and laid hold of the servant by the collar, calling to his companions that he had caught one of the thieves."
8889,6078-54013-0018.flac, there the traveling companion stopped and drawing out a little pipe from under his jacket.
8890,6078-54013-0043.flac, all was a red blaze behind them.
8891,6078-54013-0015.flac," and say not a word. do you agree to that? yes, so the servant, i do. very well said his new comrade. then let us be jogging."
8892,6078-54013-0073.flac," and then jogged all the way back home again to cook cabbage and onions and pot herbs and to make broth for wiser men, them himself to sup."
8893,6078-54013-0008.flac, why thus? so the second.
8894,6078-54013-0001.flac," day after day, time in and time out for seven years. in those years, the servant was well enough contented, but no one likes to abide in the same place forever, and so one day he took it into his head that he would like to go out into the world."
8895,6078-54013-0035.flac," he drew from his pocket the ruby ring, which he had stolen from the sorrowful young man's finger."
8896,6078-54013-0026.flac, to see what his comrade was about.
8897,6078-54013-0019.flac," to listen to the music. well, he played and played until, by and by, the door opened, and out came a serving man. hope hyper said he."
8898,6078-54013-0044.flac," on their jogged and by the time evening was at hand, they had come to a neat cottage."
8899,6078-54013-0030.flac," up, step the servants' cobrand and knocked upon the door. rat, tap, tap. by and by, it was open to crack, and their student ugly old woman, blair-eyed and crooked, and gnarled as a winter twig."
8900,6078-54013-0022.flac," thereupon he drew out his pipe and began to play, and it was such a tune as no man had ever listened to before. he played and he played, and after a while, one after another of those who listened to him, began to get drowsy. first they winked,"
8901,6078-54013-0072.flac," very well, so the wise men come in and shut the door. and for all i know, the traveling servant is there to this day. for he is not the only one in the world who has come in sight of the fruit of happiness."
8902,6078-54013-0067.flac," into the house they hauled the poor servant and into the same room where he had been before and there sat the young man at a grand feast with his wife and all his friends around him. but when the young man saw the poor serving man, he came to him."
8903,6078-54013-0065.flac," and the next day came to the town and to the house of the sorrowful young man. their, low and behold, instead of being dark and silent as it was before, all was ablaze with light and noisy with the sound of rejoicing and mariment."
8904,6078-54013-0060.flac," but to bring an apple for me also. then the poor traveling servant began to thump his head. he saw well enough through the millstone now, and that he too might have had one of the fruit if he had but held his tongue a little longer."
8905,6078-54013-0068.flac, and took him by the hand and set him the side himself at the table.
8906,6078-54013-0017.flac, the servants companion in the gate as though he knew the place right well and led the way up one street and down another until by and by they came to a noble house that stood a little apart by itself with gardens of flowers and fruit trees all around it
8907,6078-54013-0020.flac," where dozens of servants were serving a fine feast. but only one man sat at the table, a young man with a face so sorrowful that it made a body's heart ache to look upon him. can you play a good music-piper?"" said he."
8908,6078-54013-0028.flac," but the next day they jogged on together again until by and by they came to a great forest. there they wandered up and down, till night came upon them and found them still stumbling onward through the darkness."
8909,6078-54013-0069.flac," it was the ring of discord that breadstrife, wherever it came."
8910,6078-54013-0042.flac," he gathered together a great heap of straw and sticks of wood, and stuffed all under the corner of the house. then he struck a light and set fire to it."
8911,6078-54013-0027.flac," none was more ugly than this. to be which the poor, sorrowful young man and to asleep, and then to rob him of the ruby ring,"
8912,6078-54013-0047.flac," and my son himself should go with you to show you the way. that is good, said the servants' comrade, and if he will do so, i will pay him well for his trouble. so the young man put on his hat and took up his stick."
8913,6078-54013-0078.flac, clattered the bottom of his cannican against the table.
8914,6078-54013-0009.flac, and there we would find a man sitting.
8915,6078-54013-0036.flac," then he led the way out of the house. and if the surveyman had wondered the day before, at that which the comrade did, he wondered ten times more to see him give so beautiful ring."
8916,6078-54013-0025.flac," and stepping up to the young man, took from off his finger a splendid ruby ring, as red as blood and as bright as fire, and popped the same into his pocket. and all the while, the surveyman stood gaping like a fish,"
8917,6078-54013-0055.flac," thereupon, as he ended speaking, he struck his staff upon the ground, instantly the earth trembled and the sky darkened overhead until it grew as black as night."
8918,6078-54013-0064.flac," he gave it to the captain of the band, and after he had gone, the robbers fought for it with one another until they were all killed, so now the world is rhythm, and the travelers can come and go as they please. back jogged the traveling servant."
8919,6078-54013-0041.flac, for i have a bit of work to do before i leave this place. and strange work it was.
8920,6078-54013-0012.flac," and wish, and whatever one asks for, one shall have. you may guess that when the servant understood the talk of the ravens, he was not slow in making use of what he had heard. a piece scrambled,"
8921,6078-54013-0075.flac," i would as leave as not. i liked the story well enough, piped up the little tailor who had killed seven flies at a blow, twas a good enough story of its sort. but why does nobody tell a tell of good big giants and of wild boars and of unicorns?"
8922,6078-54013-0076.flac," such as i killed in my adventures, you what of? old alebaba had been sitting with his hands folded in his eyes closed. now he opened them and looked at the little tailor."
8923,6078-54013-0014.flac, there is one condition you must fulfill. many strange things will happen upon our journey between here and there.
8924,6078-54013-0058.flac," and she was dressed in clothes fit for a queen to wear, shining with gold and silver and precious stones. the servants stood and stared like one in berift of wits."
8925,6078-54013-0005.flac," paying his way with the few pennies he had saved in his seven years of service. but for all of his traveling, nothing good happened to him. until one morning, he came to a lonely place where there stood a gallows. and there he sat him down to rest."
8926,6078-54013-0063.flac," the next morning, the poor servant jogged a lawn on his homeward way, more sad and downcast than ever, and by evening he had come to the robbers' den in the thick woods, and there the old woman came running to the door to meet him."
8927,6078-54013-0038.flac, and there the comrade knocked upon the door and asked for lodging.
8928,6078-54013-0048.flac, and off went the three uphill and downdale until by and by they came over the top of the last hill and there below them lay the garden. and what a sight it was. the leaves shining and glistening like so many jewels in the sunlight.
8929,6078-54013-0037.flac, the two travelers came to a little hut. need enough?
8930,6078-54013-0023.flac," then they shut their eyes, and then they nodded until all were as dumb as logs, and it sounded sleep as though they would never wake in again, only the servant and the piper stayed awake, for the music did not make them drowsy as it did the rest."
8931,6078-54013-0032.flac," trembling like a leaf at what he had heard. the old woman gave them some bread and meat to eat, and then hid them away in a great empty meal chest in the corner, and there they lay as still as mice."
8932,6078-54013-0039.flac," nevertheless, they made the travelers welcome and set before them the very best that was to be had in the house. and after both had eaten and drunk, they showed him to a bed in a corner as clean as snow. and there they slept the night through."
8933,6078-54013-0007.flac," there, they began talking to one another, and the servant popped the pebble into his mouth to hear what they might say. yonder is a traveler in the world."" said the first raven. yes! so the second."
8934,6078-54013-0046.flac," but in the morning he told the widow whether they were going and asked if she and her son knew the way to the garden where grew the fruit of happiness. yes, said she, that we do, for the garden is not a day's journey from here."
8935,6078-54013-0061.flac," the house that he had seen the angel set fire to. there he beheld mason's and carpenter's heart at work, hacking and huing, and building a fine new house. and there he saw the poor man himself standing by giving them orders. how is this, said the traveling servant?"
8936,6078-54013-0016.flac," and the time is not too long to get there. so all the rest of that day, they journeyed onward together until towards evening they came to a town with high towers and steep roofs and tall spires."
8937,6078-54013-0003.flac," you have served me faithfully these seven years gone. and now that you ask to leave to go, you shall go. but it is little or nothing in a way of money that i can give you. and so you will have to be content with what i can afford."
8938,6078-54013-0049.flac, all he could do was to stand and look.
8939,6078-54013-0011.flac," the fruit of happiness,"" said the first raven, and of what use would the fruit of happiness be to him?"
8940,6078-54013-0002.flac, to see what kind of a fortune a man might make there for himself.
8941,6078-54013-0057.flac," but what a change he beheld. it was the poor cottage no longer, but a splendid palace. fit for a queen to dwell in."
8942,6078-54013-0013.flac," and away he went as fast as his legs could carry him. on and on he traveled until he came to the crossroads and the stone cross of which the raven spoke. and there, sure enough, set the traveler."
8943,6078-54013-0077.flac," who as as big as a giant and six times as powerful. and besides that, he added,"
8944,6078-54013-0074.flac," no offense,"" said the blacksmith. i meant not to speak ill of your story. come, comsir. will you not take a pot of ale with me?"" why, said st. george, somewhat modified."
8945,6078-54013-0010.flac, that man would lead him to the garden.
8946,6078-54013-0004.flac," see, here is a little pebble and its like is not to be found in the seven kingdoms. for whoever holds it in his mouth can hear while he does so."
8947,6078-54013-0054.flac," such abuse, as he showered upon his traveling companion, no man had ever listened to before. but to all the servants said, the other answered never a word until he had stopped for sure want of breath. then, poor fool, so the traveling companion,"
8948,6078-54013-0034.flac, how they had cruelly robbed and murdered poor people.
8949,6078-54013-0006.flac," and it is just in such an unlikely place as this, that a man's best chance of fortune comes to him sometimes. as the servants sat there, there came two ravens flying and lit upon the cross beam overhead."
8950,6078-54013-0050.flac," torrent without a bridge for a body to cross over. yonder is what you seek, so the young man pointing with his finger, and there you can see for yourself the fruit of happiness."
8951,6078-54013-0033.flac," by and by, in came the gang of thieves with a great noise and uproar, and down they sat to their supper."
8952,6078-54013-0052.flac, that is your reward for your service.
8953,6078-54013-0029.flac," he seemed to doubt nothing nor fear nothing, but trudged straight ahead until, by and by, they saw a light twinkling far away. and when they came to it, they found a gloomy stone house, as ugly as eyes ever looked upon."
8954,6078-54013-0021.flac," but suddenly everything went wrong. his wife and he fell out and quarreled until there was no living together, and she had to go back to her old home. then his companions deserted him, and now he lived all alone. yours is a hard case, said the traveling companion."
8955,6078-54013-0059.flac, and angel came and showed the way to my son.
8956,3982-182255-0032.flac," unity of the country. if therefore mr. newbury and mr. overhand were found to be discussing the corrupt state of their city, they only shared in the national sentiments of the moment. in fact, in the same city, hundreds of other citizens."
8957,3982-182255-0035.flac," on the expropriation committee itself. and worse than that, alderman undercut was a butcher in a city that consumed a thousand tons of meat every week and alderman o'hooligan, it leaked out, was an irishman."
8958,3982-182255-0004.flac," and then, leaning forwards in his chair and looking carefully about the quarters of the club, he spoke behind his hand and said, and the mayors, the biggest grafter of the lot. and what's more, he added,"
8959,3982-182255-0044.flac, you want to let the boys know to keep pretty dark and go easy. there's a lot of talk i don't like about the elections going around the town. let the boys know that just for a while the darker they keep the better. whereupon the word was passed.
8960,3982-182255-0028.flac," how and where this movement of indignation had started? people said that it was part of a new wave of public morality that was sweeping over the entire united states. certainly, it was being remarked in almost every section of the country."
8961,3982-182255-0021.flac," everybody felt it at once. people wondered how any sane, intelligent community could tolerate the presence of a set of corrupt scoundrels like the 20 alderman of the city. their names, it was said,"
8962,3982-182255-0020.flac," but it is the one that was used. look at the alderman, they said, rotten. look at the city solicitor, rotten. and as for the mayor himself, whoo! the thing came like a wave."
8963,3982-182255-0037.flac," when mr. newbury said, it's worse than russia, he meant it, every word. now, just as mr. newbury and mr. dick overland were finishing their discussion, the huge bulky form of mayor mcgrath came pondersly past them as they sat."
8964,3982-182255-0024.flac," others were butchers, two were grocers, and all of them wore blue checkered weskets and red ties, and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets. nobody had ever really thought about them. that is to say, nobody on plutoria avenue."
8965,3982-182255-0009.flac," when mr. newbury and mr. dick over and were young, men went into congress from pure patriotism. there was no such thing as graft or crookedness, as they both admitted in those days. and as for the united states senate?"
8966,3982-182255-0015.flac," it thrilled him. he would never forget it. it stayed in his memory as if it were yesterday. but as for the present legislature, here mr. dick overens sadly nodded a cent in advance to what he knew was coming."
8967,3982-182255-0027.flac," oh, i see, i beg your pardon. i thought it might be somebody important."
8968,3982-182255-0011.flac," and then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey and soda. then naturally, speaking of the rottenness of the federal government, had led them to talk of the rottenness of the state legislature."
8969,3982-182255-0041.flac," warm evening, is it not? the mayor gave no other answer than that deep guttural grunt, which is technically known in municipal interviews as refusing to commit oneself. did he hear?"
8970,3982-182255-0012.flac," how different from the state legislatures that they remembered as young men? not merely different in the matter of graft, but different, so mr. newbury said, in the caliber of the men."
8971,3982-182255-0025.flac," sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was. but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it, one said, oh, i see, an alderman. and turned to something else. who's funeral is that?"
8972,3982-182255-0002.flac," absolutely, rotten, a scented mr. dick overand ringing the bell for a second whiskey and soda. corrupt, said mr. newbury, between two puffs of his cigar. full of graft, said mr. overand."
8973,3982-182255-0000.flac, chapter 8. the great fight for clean government.
8974,3982-182255-0005.flac," syncing his voice to a whisper, that time has come to speak out about it fearlessly. mr. overn nodded. it's a tyranny, he said. worst than russia rejoined mr. newberry."
8975,3982-182255-0003.flac," flicking his ashes into the grate. crooked alderman said mr. newbury, a bum-city solicitor said mr. overand, and an infernal grafter for a treasurer. yes, a scented mr. newbury."
8976,3982-182255-0014.flac," then a legislature. he said he distinctly recalled a man whose name he didn't recollect. speaking on a question, he didn't just remember what, either for or against."
8977,3982-182255-0039.flac," being a politician, he merely said, good evening gentlemen, without a sign of disturbance. good evening, mr. mayor,"" said mr. newbury, rubbing his hands feebly together, and speaking in and"
8978,3982-182255-0017.flac," from speaking of the crookedness of the state government, mr. newbury and mr. dick overland were led to talk of the crookedness of the city government. and they both agreed, as above, that things were worse than in russia. what secretly irritated them both most."
8979,3982-182255-0036.flac," imagine it! an irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where 38 and a half out of every hundred policemen were irish, either by birth or parentage. the thing was monstrous."
8980,3982-182255-0043.flac," which was situated in the rear end of a saloon and pool room far down in the town. boys, he said to alderman o'hulligan and alderman gorfinkle, who were playing freeze out poker in a corner behind the pool tables."
8981,3982-182255-0022.flac, were simply a byword throughout the united states for rank criminal corruption. this was said so widely that everybody started hunting through the daily papers to try to find out who in blazes were aldermen anyhow.
8982,3982-182255-0026.flac," a man would sometimes ask on plutoria avenue. oh, just one of the city aldermen."
8983,3982-182255-0030.flac," they called it the spirit of william penn. in the south it was said to be the reassertion of southern chivalry, making itself felt against the greed and selfishness of the north. while in the north they recognized it at once."
8984,3982-182255-0018.flac," was that they had lived and done business under this infernal corruption for 30 or 40 years and hadn't noticed it. they had been too busy. the fact was that their conversation reflected not so much their own original ideas,"
8985,3982-182255-0029.flac," chicago newspapers were attributing its origin to the new vigor and the fresh ideals of the middle west. in boston, it was said to be due to a revival of the grand old new england spirit. in philadelphia,"
8986,3982-182255-0034.flac," in a city with 150 deaths a week, and sometimes even better, an undertaker sat on the council. a city that was about to expropriate land and to spend $400,000 for a new cemetery had an undertaker"
8987,3982-182255-0031.flac," as a protest against the sluggishness and ignorance of the south. in the west, they spoke of it as a revolt against the spirit of the east, and in the east they called it a reaction against the lawlessness of the west. but everywhere they hailed it, as a new sign of the glorious"
8988,3982-182255-0006.flac, they had been sitting in a quiet corner of the club. it was on a sunday evening.
8989,3982-182255-0023.flac," and as a matter of fact, at the moment when this wave of feelings struck the city, nobody knew or cared who were aldermen anyway. to tell the truth, the aldermen had been much the same persons for about 15 or 20 years, somewhere in the produce business."
8990,3982-182255-0045.flac," from the thomas jefferson club to the george washington club, and thence to the eureka club, colored and to the kosooth club, hungarian, and to various other centers of civic patriotism in the lower parts of the city."
8991,3982-182255-0040.flac," ingratiating tone. there is no more pitiable spectacle than an honest man caught in the act of speaking boldly and fearlessly of the evil-doer. good evening, mr. mayor, echoed mr. dick overand, also rubbing his hands."
8992,3982-182255-0019.flac," as a general wave of feeling that was passing over the whole community. there had come a moment, quite suddenly it seemed, when it occurred to everybody at the same time that the whole government of the city was rotten. the word is a strong one."
8993,3982-182255-0013.flac," he recalled how he had been taken as a boy of twelve by his father to hear a debate. he would never forget it. giants, he said. that was what they were. in fact, the thing was more like a vittngamot."
8994,3982-182255-0001.flac," as to the government of this city,"" said mr. newbury, leaning back in a leather armchair at the mausoleum club, and lighting a second cigar, it's rotten, that's all."
8995,3982-182255-0038.flac," he looked at them sideways out of his eyes. he had eyes like plums in a modeled face. and being a born politician, he knew by the very look of them that they were talking of something that they had no business to be talking about."
8996,3982-182255-0008.flac, the rottenness of the federal government didn't anger them. it merely grieved them. they could remember both of them. how different everything was when they were young men just entering on life.
8997,3982-182255-0033.flac," as disinterested as themselves, were waking up to the realization of what was going on. as soon as people began to look into the condition of things in the city, they were horrified at what they found. it was discovered, for example,"
8998,3982-182255-0016.flac," as for the present legislature, well, mr. newbury had had, he said, occasion to visit the state capital a week before in connection with the railway bill that he was trying to, that is, that he was anxious to"
8999,3982-182255-0042.flac," whispered mr. newbury as the mayor passed out of the club. i don't care if he did. whispered mr. dick overland. half an hour later, mayor mcgrath entered the premises of the thomas jefferson club."
9000,3982-182255-0010.flac," here their voices were almost hushed in awe. why, when they were young, the united states sent it, but no, neither of them could find a phrase big enough for their meaning. they merely repeated,"
9001,3982-182255-0007.flac," not argumentatively, or with any heat, but with the reflective sadness that steals over an elderly man, when he sits in the leather armchair of a comfortable club, smoking a good cigar, and musing on the decadence of the present day."
9002,3982-178459-0060.flac, won't you he stammered mary i'm going with father. isn't there some way you could use the money without without she gave a choked little laugh you gave me something to live for he said you kept me alive i think
9003,3982-178459-0064.flac," and without knowing what she did, she set her hands upon his breast, pushing him back from her a little. i can't! i can't! don't you see? mary! no, no! and you must go now, bibs! i can't bear anymore! please!"
9004,3982-178459-0023.flac," in love with you? no, he said. somewhere in the still air of the room, there was a whispered word. it did not seem to come from mary's part at lips, but he was aware of it. why?"
9005,3982-178459-0031.flac," and then, that i tried to marry you. you heard her say that, and you believe that i don't care for you, and that no girl could care for you. but you think that i am in such an extremity as civil was?"
9006,3982-178459-0018.flac," you've given up to your father, she said slowly. and then you came to ask me, she broke off."
9007,3982-178459-0038.flac," i knew you'd never thought of me, except generously, to give. i said i couldn't make it plain, he cried despairingly. wait! she lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously, like a child."
9008,3982-178459-0043.flac," you saw that i was fond of you. you knew i cared for you, but you didn't think i might be in love with you. but you saw that i might marry you without being in love with you."
9009,3982-178459-0008.flac," she paused, and he came in, not lifting his eyes to hers. always when he crossed that threshold he had come with his head up, and his wistful gaze seeking hers."
9010,3982-178459-0015.flac," both of her hands leaped to her cheeks. she grew red and then white. she rose slowly and moved backward from him, staring at him, at first incredulously, then with an intense perplexity more and more luminous in her wide eyes."
9011,3982-178459-0027.flac," she turned away, went to the bare little black mantle, and stood leaning upon it. presently she asked, when did mrs. roscoe share it and say that no girl could care about you?"
9012,3982-178459-0005.flac," she glanced back at bibs who had turned north. he walks kind of slow and stooped over like. so much money in his pockets it makes him sag, i guess, said the young husband with bitter admiration."
9013,3982-178459-0050.flac," and i wonder myself why? when a family loses its money, people always say the daughters ought to go and be stenographers. it's curious."
9014,3982-178459-0053.flac," i went out to be fascinating and to be married. i did it openly at least, and with a kind of decent honesty, i told your brother i had meant to fascinate him."
9015,3982-178459-0026.flac," well, not as particularly captivating. oddly enough mary's pal are changed to an angry flush. those two, she exclaimed sharply, and then, with thorough going contempt, lambhorn. that's like them."
9016,3982-178459-0032.flac," you took your father's offer and then came to ask me to marry you. what had i shown you of myself that could make you suddenly she sank down, kneeling, with her face buried in her arms upon the lap of the chair?"
9017,3982-178459-0017.flac," bibbs, look at me. her voice was loud and clear. what made you say that? look at me. he could not look at her. and he could not speak. what was it that made you, she said? i want you to tell me."
9018,3982-178459-0046.flac," i didn't know you could cry. listen, she said. listen till i get through, i want you to understand. we were poor, and we weren't fitted to be. we never had been, and we didn't know what to do."
9019,3982-178459-0058.flac," i asked his pardon and i said i would not marry him. i posted the letter, but he never got it. that was the afternoon he was killed. that's all, bibs. now you know what i did. and you know..."
9020,3982-178459-0052.flac," and i didn't know how to be a stenographer. i didn't know how to be anything, except a well-to-do old maid or somebody's wife. and i couldn't be a well-to-do old maid. then bibs, i did what i'd been raised to know how to do."
9021,3982-178459-0047.flac," we'd been almost rich. it was plenty, but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the town. he wanted to be richer. but instead, well, just about the time your father finished building next door,"
9022,3982-178459-0039.flac," help me up, bibs. then when she was once more upon her feet, she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him rooffully and faintly, but reassuringly, as if to tell him in that way."
9023,3982-178459-0040.flac," that she knew he had not meant to hurt her. and that smile of hers, so lamentable, but so faithfully friendly, misted his own eyes, for his shame-facedness lowered them no more."
9024,3982-178459-0010.flac, they've made you give up. your father's won. you're going to do what he wants. you've given up.
9025,3982-178459-0055.flac," but i think that though i did mean to marry him, i never should have done it. because that sort of a marriage is... it's sacrilege. something would have stopped me."
9026,3982-178459-0035.flac, you seemed to lean down out of a rosy cloud to be kind to me. i never dreamed i could do anything for you. i never dreamed you could need anything to be done for you by anybody.
9027,3982-178459-0007.flac, what's the matter? i saw something was terribly wrong when i...
9028,3982-178459-0061.flac, and i've hurt you like this.
9029,3982-178459-0000.flac," chapter 29 as bibbs came out of the new house, a sunday trio was in course of passage upon the sidewalk, an ample young woman, placid of face, a black clad,"
9030,3982-178459-0020.flac," let me think. it's something that happened since i walked this morning. yes, since you left me at noon. something happened that she stopped abruptly."
9031,3982-178459-0056.flac," she meant no harm, but she was horrible and she put what i was doing into such horrible words and they were the truth. oh, i saw myself she was proposing a miserable compact with me"
9032,3982-178459-0054.flac, but i let him think that perhaps i meant to marry him. i think i did mean to marry him. i had never cared for anybody and i thought it might be there really wasn't anything more than a kind of excited fondness. i can't be sure
9033,3982-178459-0036.flac, and today i heard that you...
9034,3982-178459-0065.flac," mary! never, never, never!"" she cried in a passion of tears. you mustn't come anymore. i can't see you, dear. never, never, never. somehow, in helpless, stumbling obedience to her besieging gesture,"
9035,3982-178459-0051.flac," no, i'd been raised to be either married comfortably or a well-to-do old maid if i chose not to marry. the poverty came on slowly, bibs, but at last it was all there."
9036,3982-178459-0037.flac," anyone with money, she sobbed. and you thought we were so... so desperate. you believe that i had... no, he said quickly. i didn't believe you'd done one kind thing for me for that. no, no, no."
9037,3982-178459-0042.flac," you didn't believe that i'd try to make you fall in love with me? never. never for an instant. you didn't believe i'd try to make you want to marry me? no, no, no. i believe it, bibs."
9038,3982-178459-0059.flac," she pressed her clenched hands tightly against her eyes, leaning far forward, her head bowed before him. vibsid forgotten himself long ago. his heart broke for her. couldn't you—isn't there—"
9039,3982-178459-0029.flac," answer me once more,"" she said. vibs, do you know now why i stopped wearing my fur's? yes. i thought so. your sister-in-law told you, didn't she? i..."
9040,3982-178459-0002.flac," sunday fide, and made fit to dine with the wife's relatives. how'd you like for me to be that young fella, mama?"" the husband whispered. he's one of the sons, and they're ain't but two left now."
9041,3982-178459-0003.flac," the wife stared curiously at bibs. well, i don't know,"" she returned. he looked to me like he had his own troubles. ""'i expect he has, like anybody else,' said the young husband. but i guess we could stand a good deal if we had his money.'"
9042,3982-178459-0014.flac," mary, he said, could you marry me? what did you say, bibs?"" she asked quietly. his tone and attitude did not change. will you marry me?"
9043,3982-178459-0011.flac," affirmation. she gave a little cry of compassion, and came and sat near him, «bibs», she said. «i can be glad of one thing, though it's selfish. i can be glad you came straight to me. it's more to me than even if you'd come because you were happy."
9044,3982-178459-0016.flac," it was like a spoken question. the room filled with strangeness in the long silence. the two were so strange to each other. at last she said, what made you say that? he did not answer."
9045,3982-178459-0013.flac," could you tell me about it? do you want to? still he did not look up. but in a voice shaken and husky, he asked her a question so grotesque that at first she thought she had misunderstood his words."
9046,3982-178459-0049.flac, you might wonder why i didn't.
9047,3982-178459-0006.flac," mary, happening to glance from a window, saw bibs coming, and she started, clasping her hands together in a sudden alarm."
9048,3982-178459-0045.flac," i did try to make jim want to marry me. i did."" and she sank down into the chair, weeping bitterly again. bibbs was agonized. ""'mary,' he groaned."
9049,3982-178459-0022.flac," you could. she looked at him and slowly shook her head. bibs, do you... her voice was as unsteady as his. little more than a whisper. do you think i'm..."
9050,3982-178459-0025.flac," and when i first came home, edith told me, sible was so anxious to marry that she'd have married me. she meant it to express sible's extremity, you see. but i hardly needed either of them to tell me. i hadn't thought of myself as..."
9051,3982-178459-0044.flac, because you did believe i had tried to marry your brother and mary i only knew for the first time that you that you were were desperately poor she said you can't even say that bibbs it was true
9052,3982-178459-0009.flac," ah, poor boy,"" she said, with the gesture of understanding and pity. i know what it is. he followed her into the room where they always sat, and sank into a chair. ""'you needn't tell me,' she said."
9053,3982-178459-0001.flac," thin young man, whose expression was one of habitual anxiety, habitual weariness, and habitual eagerness. he propelled a perambulator containing the third."
9054,3982-178459-0048.flac," we found we hadn't anything. people say that sometimes, meaning that they haven't anything in comparison with other people of their own kind, but we really hadn't anything. we hadn't anything at all, bibs."
9055,3982-178459-0063.flac," can't what, bibs? you couldn't marry you, she said for him. yes. no, no, no! she sprang up facing him."
9056,3982-178459-0057.flac," and i couldn't breathe the air of the same room with her, though i'd so cheapened myself that she had a right to assume that i would. but i couldn't. i left her, and i wrote to your brother just a quick scrawl. i told him just what i'd done."
9057,3982-178459-0024.flac," i've had nothing but dreams, bibb said, decilitly. but they weren't like that. sybil said no girl could care about me. he smiled faintly."
9058,3982-178459-0004.flac," well, maybe if you keep on the way you've been."
9059,3982-178459-0041.flac," let me tell you what you want to tell me,"" she said. you can't, because you can't put it into words. they are too humiliating for me, and you're too gentle to say them. tell me, though. isn't it true?"
9060,3982-178459-0066.flac, he got himself to the door.
9061,3982-178459-0034.flac," he said, i can't make it plain. from the first of your loveliness to me, i was all self. it was always you that gave and i that took. i was the dependent. i did nothing but lean on you."
9062,3982-178459-0030.flac," i heard her say. i think i know what happened now."" mary's breath came fast, and her voice shook, but she spoke rapidly. you heard her say more than that. you heard her say that we were bitterly poor. and on that account i tried first to marry your brother, and then"
9063,3982-178459-0012.flac, she did not speak again for a little while. then she said.
9064,3982-178459-0021.flac," with a tremulous murmur of amazement and dawning comprehension, she remembered that sible had gone to the new house. bib swallowed painfully and contrived to say, i do, i do want you to marry me if—if—"
9065,3982-178459-0062.flac," oh, a thousand times! her right hand went out in a faltering gesture and just touched his own for an instant. but there's nothing to forgive. and you can't. you can't."
9066,3982-178459-0033.flac," tears overwhelming her. mary. mary, he cried helplessly. oh, no! you don't understand. i do, though. she sobbed. i do. he came and stood beside her. you kill me."
9067,3982-178459-0019.flac," yes, he said just audibly. no, she cried. you do not. then what made you ask me? what is it that's happened? nothing. wait, she said."
9068,3982-178459-0028.flac," today, mary drew a deep breath. i think i'm beginning to understand a little. she bit her lip. there was anger and good truth in her eyes and in her voice."
9069,4051-11218-0030.flac," and looked very angry and excessively disturbed, for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece, if his courage and skill should enable him to do so. but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls,"
9070,4051-11218-0025.flac, that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled.
9071,4051-11218-0017.flac," and instead of running any further toward jason, they had began to fight among themselves. the confusion spread through the host."
9072,4051-11218-0041.flac," their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed, and with their fierceness, the two furnaces and their stomachs had likewise been extinguished."
9073,4051-11218-0051.flac," on which he felt inclined to finish his meal. in various directions, he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees, stretching out his neck a terrible long way. now here."
9074,4051-11218-0046.flac," what is it, as jason? have you come so far to seek it?"
9075,4051-11218-0006.flac," a large tract of black earth, ready to be sown with the dragon's teeth. so jason scattered them broadcast and harried them into the soil with the brush hairrow and took a stand on the edge of the field, anxious to see what would happen next."
9076,4051-11218-0049.flac," the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jason's memory. soon, however, something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered. an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came..."
9077,4051-11218-0062.flac," have herbindicurally ready to let fall into the water. as jason drew near, he heard the talking image calling to him, with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave, sweet voice. make haste, prince jason, for your life. make haste."
9078,4051-11218-0031.flac," and the dragon's teeth, the king fear that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon, and therefore, though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful, he was resolved, and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentant."
9079,4051-11218-0028.flac, the field has been plowed. the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast and herald into the soil.
9080,4051-11218-0054.flac," what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden police?"" jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward. stay you foolish youth! sid media grasping his arm."
9081,4051-11218-0010.flac," tore themselves up by the roots. wherever a dragon's tooth had fallen, they arsed a man armed with the battle. they made a clanger with their swords against their shields, and eyed one another fiercely."
9082,4051-11218-0057.flac, and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down again. the dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless. it is only a sleeping person said the enchantress to prince jason.
9083,4051-11218-0036.flac," and although she had done him so much service only the night before, he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset. these enchantresses, you must know, are never to be depended on."
9084,4051-11218-0018.flac," hewing and stabbing at one another, lopping off arms, heads, and legs, and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration. although, at the same time, he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other,"
9085,4051-11218-0035.flac," at so many mouthfuls by the dragon, but as jason was hastening down the palest steps."
9086,4051-11218-0061.flac," although several stone walls, a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between. by his advice, the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley"
9087,4051-11218-0043.flac," how they had contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine. but now, instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulfurous vapor, they breathed the very sweetest of cowbreath. you're kindly patting the bowls."
9088,4051-11218-0052.flac," upon my word, as the head came waving and undulating through the air, and reaching almost within arm's length of prince jason, it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight."
9089,4051-11218-0012.flac," and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world, like alexander or napoleon, to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did."
9090,4051-11218-0047.flac," when it glitters before your eyes, it is the golden fleece. jason went onward a few steps further, and then stopped to gaze. oh, how beautiful it looked, shining with a marvelous light of its own, that it"
9091,4051-11218-0022.flac," let them sleep in a bed of honor so the princess medea, with a sligh smile at jason, the world will always have simpletons enough just like them, fighting and dying for they know not what, and fencing that posterity."
9092,4051-11218-0038.flac," and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden police, whether i slay the dragon or no. yes, jason, said the princess, and i can tell you more, unless you set sail from colcus"
9093,4051-11218-0050.flac," for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung, and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws. after this feat, the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach."
9094,4051-11218-0039.flac, stealing through the streets of caucasus and their way to the sacred grove.
9095,4051-11218-0001.flac," just as the brazen broods fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air, he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwed up tail and held them in a grip like that of an iron vice. one with his right hand, the other with his left."
9096,4051-11218-0008.flac, and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle. bye bye and bye all over the field.
9097,4051-11218-0019.flac," for defense which he himself had committed. in an incredibly short space of time, also short indeed as it had taken them to grow up, all but one of the heroes of the dragon's teeth were stretched lifeless on the field."
9098,4051-11218-0033.flac," to speak my mind plainly, you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks. jason left the king's presence in great sorrow and anger. he could think of nothing better."
9099,4051-11218-0042.flac," than ever before. indeed, it had here to for, but a great inconvenience to those poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass, the fire out of their nostrils had tripled it up before they could manage to crop it."
9100,4051-11218-0021.flac, when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren. and there was the end of that army that had sprouted from the dragon's teeth. that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth.
9101,4051-11218-0002.flac," to be sure, but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them. and ever since that time,"
9102,4051-11218-0055.flac," far more affectionately than your sword. the dragon had probably heard the voices, for swift is lightning, his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again, darting full 40 feet at a stretch. as it approached,"
9103,4051-11218-0007.flac," must we wait long for the harvest time, he inquired of medea, who was now standing by his side. whether sooner or later it will be sure to come, answered the princess. a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragon's teeth have been soon."
9104,4051-11218-0020.flac," the last survivor, the bravest and strongest of the whole, who had just forced enough to wave his crimson sword over his head, and give a shout of exaltation, crying, victory, victory, immortal fame."
9105,4051-11218-0011.flac," full of rage and stormy passions, and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense for the boon of their own existence."
9106,4051-11218-0058.flac, so i did not wish to kill him outright. quick! snatch the prize and let us be gone. you have won the golden fleece. jason caught the fleece from the tree.
9107,4051-11218-0023.flac, will take the trouble to put laurels on their rusty and battered helmets. could you help smiling prince jason to see the self-conceit of that last fellow?
9108,4051-11218-0026.flac," entering the presence chamber, he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obiessence. your eyes look heavy, prince jason, observed the king. you appear to have spent a sleepless night."
9109,4051-11218-0059.flac, with her peacock beside her. she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste. disappeared among the duskiness of the trees.
9110,4051-11218-0014.flac," and a hundred other outcries, such as men always bellow forth on a battlefield, in which these dragon people seemed to have had their tongues end. at last, the front crank caught sight of jason, who, beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight,"
9111,4051-11218-0027.flac, and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazen lunged bulls.
9112,4051-11218-0029.flac, and depart with my nine and 40 comrades.
9113,4051-11218-0034.flac," march at once to the grove of mars, slide the dragon, take position of the golden police, get on board the argo, and spread all sail for yokees. the success of the scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point."
9114,4051-11218-0009.flac," like sparkling drops of dew, these bright objects sprouted higher, improved to be the steel heads of spears. then, there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets, beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil."
9115,4051-11218-0004.flac, it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plow.
9116,4051-11218-0060.flac," who were transporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft. jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible, but lincius, with his sharp eyes, had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden police."
9117,4051-11218-0032.flac," not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece. you never would have succeeded in this business, young man,"" said he, if my undutiful daughter, medea, had not helped you with her enchantments. had you acted fairly, you would have been, at this instance,"
9118,4051-11218-0024.flac," you will think differently in the morning, simidia. true, the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it, but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs. have an object. you know, come. your nights work has been well-performed."
9119,4051-11218-0040.flac," loing, nodding their heads and threshing forth their snouts, which is other cattle do."
9120,4051-11218-0044.flac," jason followed medea's guidance into the grove of mars, where the great oak trees that have been growing for centuries, threw so thick a shade that the moonbeam struggled vainly to find their way through it."
9121,4051-11218-0015.flac," i thought it best to draw his sword. and a moment all the sons of the dragon's teeth appear to take jason for an enemy, and crying with one voice, guard the golden fleece. they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears."
9122,4051-11218-0003.flac," when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns, and to grip him by the tail is pretty much the same thing that is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it."
9123,4051-11218-0013.flac," clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the red hot thirst for battle. then they began to shout. show us the enemy, lead us to the charge. death or victory. come on, brave comrades. conquer or die."
9124,4051-11218-0037.flac," will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble?"" on the contrary, answer jason. he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragon's teeth."
9125,4051-11218-0053.flac," the gait of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the king's palace. well, jason, whispered medea, for she was ill-natured as all enchantresses are, and wanted to make the bold youth tremble."
9126,4051-11218-0000.flac, greatly encouraged finding himself not yet turned into a cinder.
9127,4051-11218-0045.flac," medea squeezed jason's hand. look yonder, she whispered. do you see it? gleaming among the venerable oaks, there was a radiance, not like the moonbeams, but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun."
9128,4051-11218-0005.flac," who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed by the plow. at any rate, our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the green sword, and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky, the plowed field lay before him."
9129,4051-11218-0016.flac," the young men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes. when he let fly the stone, and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft."
9130,4051-11218-0056.flac," medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monsters wide open throat. immediately, with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle, flinging his tail up to the tip-top of the tallest tree,"
9131,4051-11218-0048.flac," prize which so many heroes had long to behold, but had perished in the quest of it, either by the perils of their voyage, or by the fiery breath of the brazen-lunged bulls. how gloriously it shines, cry jason, and a rapture."
9132,4051-10927-0010.flac," and is this you, siddalexia alexandrovich, quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his fingers?"
9133,4051-10927-0009.flac," i wasn't dull, does that offend you? alexiel exy-injubits shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack."
9134,4051-10927-0014.flac," but judging by the impression made on the company, everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired. i positively don't understand,"" said anna, shugging her shoulders. he doesn't care, she thought."
9135,4051-10927-0005.flac," that she did not care to say a word about herself meant a great deal. he saw that the innmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto leant open before him were closed against him. more than that, he saw from her tone"
9136,4051-10927-0011.flac," what do you want of me?"" alexei alexandrovich paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes. he saw that instead of doing as he intended, that is to say, warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world,"
9137,4051-10927-0006.flac," that she was not even perturbed at that. but as it were said straight out to him, yes, it's shut up, and so it must be, and will be in the future. now he experienced a feeling, such as a man might have returning home and finding his own house locked up."
9138,4051-10927-0004.flac," she noticed it and asked him the reason, to him, knowing that every joy, every pleasure, and pain that she felt, she communicated to him at once. to him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind."
9139,4051-10927-0001.flac," why, what is it? what about she asked sitting down? well, let's talk if it's so necessary, but it would be better to get to sleep. anna said what came to her lips and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying."
9140,4051-10927-0012.flac," he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the fare for conscience, and with struggling against the barrier he fancied between them."
9141,4051-10927-0024.flac," when she came into the bedroom, he was already in bed. his lips were sternly compressed, and his eyes looked away from her. anna got into her bed and lay, expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again. she both feared his speaking and wished for it."
9142,4051-10927-0025.flac," but he was silent. she waited for a long while without moving. and he had forgotten about him. she thought of that other. she pictured him, and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him. suddenly,"
9143,4051-10927-0026.flac," she heard an even tranquil snore. for the first instant alexia alexandrovich seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased, but after an interval of two breathings, the snore sounded again."
9144,4051-10927-0003.flac," that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural, either in the sound or the sense of her words. but to him, knowing her, knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual,"
9145,4051-10927-0015.flac," but other people noticed it and that's what upsets him. you're not well, alexeal, xandrovich, she added, and she got up, and would have gone towards the door, but he moved forward as though he would stop her. his face was ugly and forbidding,"
9146,4051-10927-0018.flac, to myself and to god to point out to you your duties. our life has been joined not by man but by god. that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own testisement.
9147,4051-10927-0000.flac," it's late alexei alexandrovich, she said when she had gone through the doorway. anna, it's necessary for me to have a talk with you. with me, she said wonderingly. she came out from behind the door of the dressing room and looked at him."
9148,4051-10927-0020.flac," but believe me, what i say, i say as much for myself as for you. i am your husband, and i love you."" for an instant, her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away. but the word loved threw her into revolt again. she thought,"
9149,4051-10927-0016.flac," as anna had never seen him, she stopped, and bending her head back and on one side, began with her rapid hand, taking out her hairpins. well, i'm listening to what's to come,"" she said calmly and ironically, and indeed i listened with interest."
9150,4051-10927-0002.flac," how simple and natural were her words, and how likely that she was simply sleepy."
9151,4051-10927-0013.flac," and i beg you to listen to it. i consider jealousy, as you know, a humiliating, integrating feeling, and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it. but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity. this evening, it was not i observed it."
9152,4051-10927-0027.flac, with a new tranquil rhythm. it's late. it's late she whispered with a smile.
9153,4051-10927-0017.flac," began alexia alexandrovich, feriting in one soul went off in ferrets out something that might have laid there unnoticed. your feelings are in a fair of your own conscience."
9154,4051-10927-0022.flac, then my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place.
9155,4051-10927-0008.flac," your two animated conversation this evening with kalt-vronsky, he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis, attracted attention. he talked and looked at her, laughing eyes, which frightened him now with their impenetrable look."
9156,4051-10927-0019.flac," i don't understand a word, an oh dear, how sleepy i am, unlikely,"" she said, rapidly passing her hand through her hair, feeling for the remaining hairpins. and if for god's sake don't speak like that, he said gently. perhaps i am mistaken."
9157,4051-10927-0021.flac," love! can he love? if he hadn't heard there was such a thing as love, he would never have used the word. he doesn't even know what love is. alexia alexandrovich, really i don't understand, she said, define what it is you find."
9158,4051-10927-0007.flac," but perhaps the key may yet be found, thought alexeal xandrovich. i want to warn you,"" he said in a low voice, that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution"
9159,4051-10927-0023.flac," in that case, i beg you to forgive me. but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them,"
9160,4051-11217-0028.flac," princess, he exclaimed, you seem indeed very wise and very powerful, but how can you help me and do the things of which you speak? are you an enchantress? yes, princess, an intermedia with a smile,"
9161,4051-11217-0031.flac," which he contained and where to meet her at midnight. only be brave at its she, and before daybreak the brazen bull shall be tamed. the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him. he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself."
9162,4051-11217-0034.flac, with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky.
9163,4051-11217-0029.flac," it is well for you that i am favorably inclined, for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon. i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason, if i only knew how to manage the brazen footed and fiery longed bulls."
9164,4051-11217-0001.flac, and had spent their play days in the outskirts of the grove in the center of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree. they are now on their way to greece and hopes of getting back a kingdom that have been wrongfully taken from their father.
9165,4051-11217-0016.flac," what are the conditions which you must fulfill before getting position of the golden police? i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree in which the prize hangs, and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful."
9166,4051-11217-0025.flac," he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face. she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery, so that while looking into them,"
9167,4051-11217-0010.flac," pray, are you on a pleasure voyage?"
9168,4051-11217-0005.flac," at all events, turn back who may, i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden police. we will none of us turn back, cried his 9 and 40 brave comrades."
9169,4051-11217-0012.flac," for kyron had taught him how to behave with propriety, whether to kings or beggars."
9170,4051-11217-0013.flac," provided i bring him the golden fleece. this, as your majesty is aware, is now hanging on a tree here at colcus, and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away. in spite of himself, the king's face twisted itself into an angry frown,"
9171,4051-11217-0011.flac, or what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court. great sir replied jason.
9172,4051-11217-0035.flac," and the farthest corner of the field. it will be excellent sport, i assure you, when they catch a glimpse of your figure. my father in all his court delighted nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order to come at the golden police."
9173,4051-11217-0026.flac," you can never be certain whether you see into the farthest steps or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom. if jason had been capable of fearing anything,"
9174,4051-11217-0004.flac, i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible. you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster.
9175,4051-11217-0006.flac," much good may it do him. an orpheus, whose customer was to set everything to music, began to harp and sing most gloriously,"
9176,4051-11217-0040.flac," one other stride did bull jason make, and suddenly, as a streak of lightning, on came these fiery animals."
9177,4051-11217-0009.flac," who dethroned his father. you are welcome, brave jason."
9178,4051-11217-0019.flac," i must encounter the peril, answer jason, composably, since it stands in the way of my purpose."
9179,4051-11217-0018.flac," which vulcan, the wonderful blacksmith, made for me. there is a furnace in each of their stomachs, and they breathe such fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody hisseth or two, gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder."
9180,4051-11217-0017.flac," true said the king, with a smile that did not look particularly good-natured. very true young man, but there are other things as hard, or perhaps a little harder, to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon. for example,"
9181,4051-11217-0008.flac, he instantly summed jason to the court.
9182,4051-11217-0020.flac," from which kedmus raised a crop of armed men. they are an enruly set of reprobeats, those sons of the dragon's teeth, and unless you treat them suitably, they will fall upon you, sword in hand."
9183,4051-11217-0002.flac," when the princes understood whether the argonats were going, they offered to turn back and guide them to colcus."
9184,4051-11217-0041.flac," as has always been the fashion with angry bulls. their breath scorched the herbage before them, so intently hot it was, indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and set it all in a light blaze. but as for jason himself."
9185,4051-11217-0022.flac," make yourself comfortable for today, and tomorrow morning, since you insist upon it, you shall try your skill at the plow. while the king talked with jason, a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne. she fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful stranger,"
9186,4051-11217-0038.flac," these, you will understand, were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls, which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they laid chewing their cuds. at the first two or three steps with jason maid,"
9187,4051-11217-0014.flac," for, above all things else in the world, he prized the golden police and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession."
9188,4051-11217-0024.flac," i can instruct you how to tame the fiery balls and sow the dragon's teeth and get the golden police. indeed, beautiful princess, answer jason, if he will do me this service, i promise to be grateful to you my whole life long, gazing at my dear"
9189,4051-11217-0032.flac," and wore them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help. at the appointed hour, he met the beautiful medea on the marvel steps of the king's palace."
9190,4051-11217-0036.flac," it makes a holiday in cokus, whenever such a thing happens. for my part i enjoyed immensely. you cannot imagine it when a mere twinkling of an eye, their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black sinder. are you sure, beautiful medea, s. jason?"
9191,4051-11217-0003.flac," every person who might venture within his reach. there are other difficulties in the way, continue the young princess."
9192,4051-11217-0021.flac," and the forefooted pendant, his schoolmaster into the bargain. why would a full hearty self-conceited coxcomb he is? we'll see what my fire-breeding bulls will do for him. well, prince jason, he continued allowed, and as complacently as he could,"
9193,4051-11217-0037.flac, the instant he made a step further.
9194,4051-11217-0033.flac," just as they had been pulled out of the monstrous jaws by cadmus long ago. medea then led jason down the palace steps, and through the silent streets of the city, and into the royal pasture ground, where the two brazen footed bulls were kept. it was a starry night,"
9195,4051-11217-0027.flac, for beautiful as she now looked.
9196,4051-11217-0015.flac, had come to kokus with the sole purpose of taking away his cheap treasure.
9197,4051-11217-0007.flac," and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst. after this, being now under the guidance of the two princes, who are well acquainted with the way,"
9198,4051-11217-0000.flac," why, if you believe me, they were the sons of that very frixus, who, in his childhood, have been carried to coqus on the back of the golden-pleast ram. since that time, frixus had married the king's daughter,"
9199,4051-11217-0039.flac," the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully, for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp, and were lifting up their hot noses to sniff the air. he went a little further,"
9200,4051-11217-0023.flac," this young woman followed him out of the room. i am the king's daughter, she said to him, and my name is mandia. i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant, and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of. if you will trust me,"
9201,4051-11217-0030.flac, which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you if you chance to be a little scorched.
9202,6454-107462-0019.flac," but those who asked between pensive sips how the facts or the letter had come his way, these were the ones who yielded dc the richest harvest of rattling skeleton bones."
9203,6454-107462-0004.flac," for whom the bottles at the presbytery went in by the back door, and what was the real cause of the quarrel between the twin mismaconerneys? but these were but blackbird scratchings, as it were,"
9204,6454-107462-0028.flac," to the first unvering words, but all that is now passed and over and safe beneath the moldering clay. at these last words the widow-garrity knew well the barrier was down,"
9205,6454-107462-0027.flac," dc had craved for corpses, but nothing so grim as that had risen to his swisky-bait until he tried the same old game on mrs. guarantee. what subtle instinct was it that had prompted him to add"
9206,6454-107462-0005.flac," upon the deep soil of the human heart. what d.c. cared about was what he called the secrets of the soul. never met a man he was want to say, with no backstairs to his mind."
9207,6454-107462-0009.flac," but as between friends, certain delicate little facts in your past life have come inadvertently to mehering. sometimes he would allude to a certain document, or"
9208,6454-107462-0037.flac," this touch of the grey feet laid a spell on dc's hankering morbidity. what turned the feet grey, he whispered?"
9209,6454-107462-0032.flac," and the two bright eyes of it and a little clay cold feet. dc knew what was coming now, and he twitched in every vein, and she so white-haired and so regular at church."
9210,6454-107462-0011.flac," but always, whatever the words, whatever the nature or sex, the shot would tell. first came the little start, the straightened figure, the paler or flush,"
9211,6454-107462-0002.flac," at first, when dc retired from the police force with a pension and an heirous, with 300 pounds, and time hung heavy on his hands, he would try to satisfy this craving through the medium of a host of small."
9212,6454-107462-0026.flac," deese concluded at once it was a foul-e-merdered corpse. but then again, you could not well conceal a corpse in someone's waistcoat, and gold coins would melt or be misled amongst the loose bricks of a sute chimney."
9213,6454-107462-0022.flac," and gnomes, which had been locked away in darkness, maybe, this many a year. well, how would i get the time to claim the childer and to wash their heads, and i working all the day at curing-stinking hides?"
9214,6454-107462-0001.flac," for being full of the sour cream of an inhuman curiosity. his curiosity, however, did not extend itself to science,"
9215,6454-107462-0003.flac," flirtations, with everybody's maid. in this way, he couldn't form himself exactly how many loaves were taken by the sweenies for a week's consumption, as compared with those which were devoured by all the casities."
9216,6454-107462-0017.flac," those who asked, after a gentle sipper to, how the letter had come into his hands, and those who asked immediately if the letter hadn't been destroyed. as a rule, from the type that demanded the letter back,"
9217,6454-107462-0008.flac," and setting the whiskey bottle but twix, his customer, and himself, with a nod which said, help yourself, he would lean forward with the soft, indulgent grin of the human man of the world, and begin. now"
9218,6454-107462-0006.flac," to ring at the front door of ordinary intercourse was not enough for him. when dc invested his wife's money in a public house, he developed a better plan. it was the plan which made him ultimately describe himself"
9219,6454-107462-0000.flac," patrick d.c. described himself as a philosopher, psychologist, and humorist. it was partly because patrick delighted in long words, and partly to excuse himself"
9220,6454-107462-0016.flac," under the three heads into which he had divided them. those who demanded with violent threats, which melted like snow before the sunshine of john jameson, the letter or the name of the informant."
9221,6454-107462-0029.flac," that fences off one human soul from another. all the same, she shook her trembling head when dc drew the cork. at her refusal, dc was struck with the most respectful compassion."
9222,6454-107462-0036.flac," let you get up and cut its throat,"" says he, and then we will be shut of the damn screeching thing. then you got the knife, ma'am, prompted dc. it was the bread knife she answered, with the ugly notches in the blade."
9223,6454-107462-0024.flac," there was one of this nature which troubled his rest long. well, the way of it was, you see, he put it up the chimney, but when the chimney sweepers come, he transferred it in his wesket."
9224,6454-107462-0007.flac, he would gently close the door of the bar parlor. pick up a tumbler. breathe on it. polish the breath. lean one elbow on the bar. look round him once again.
9225,6454-107462-0018.flac," he only caught sight of the tip of the secret's ears. from those, they were nearly always the women, who swiftly asked if he hadn't destroyed the letters, he caught shame-faced gleams of the truth."
9226,6454-107462-0020.flac," indeed, it was curiously instructive how john jameson laid down a causeway of gleaming stepping stones, so that dc might cross lightly over the turgid waters of his victims' souls."
9227,6454-107462-0013.flac," dc would make reply, but it was from a certain person whom, perhaps, we need not name. then the whiskey bottle would move forward, like upon in chess, and the next soothing words would be,"
9228,6454-107462-0015.flac, and sometimes the whole skeleton would rattle out upon the floor. he had played this game so often that almost at first sight he could classify his doops
9229,6454-107462-0021.flac," has been inadvertently revealed to me, but is forever sacred in me-brest. it was strange to see how, from the underworld of the man's mind, there would trip out the company of miss shape and hobgoblins,"
9230,6454-107462-0014.flac," and your secret is safe with me. fourth with the little skeleton in that man's cupboard would lean forward and press upon the door, until at last the door flew open and a boner to,"
9231,6454-107462-0010.flac," incriminating facts, or certain letters. he would ring the changes on these three, according to the sex and temperament, with which he had to deal."
9232,6454-107462-0012.flac," the shamed and suddenly lit eyes, and then, who told you, mr. d. c. sir? or, where did you get the letter? ah, now that would be telling."
9233,6454-107462-0035.flac," maybe it wasn't your fault. to us, maybe your man egged you on to do the shameful deed?"
9234,6454-107462-0033.flac," and the black bonnet on the head of her and all. it was the only little one she had, went on the widow, bowed almost to the bar by shame, and it always perched up on her knee and taking food from her mouth."
9235,6454-107462-0031.flac," no, ma'am, returns dc, to look at you, you'd think ma'am you could never kill a fly. and respectfully, he passed the peppermints. sometimes the widow muttered, i hears it."
9236,6454-107462-0030.flac," until that hour he had never known one single lacerated soul to climb this consolation. and to look at me she wept forthwith,"
9237,6454-107462-0025.flac," to my place, and i dropped it down the well. they found it when they let the bucket down, but i wasn't as accomplished at all, it was only connivance with me."" when he had spoken of the chimney and the well,"
9238,6454-107462-0023.flac," and he fell over on the side and busted all his veins. or? well, anne wouldn't you draw two pinch and yourself, mr. d.c., if you'd a wife with two hands like a seed for yellow gold?"
9239,6454-107462-0034.flac," but i had bad teeth in me head, and i couldn't get me rest with a jaws aching, and all the whiles it's screeching with a group, to a madden you. all the same, dc whispered,"
9240,6454-120342-0005.flac," and so, tuesday night, the metropolitan people gave up their unequal contest, all good men and angels rejoicing at their discomforture, and only a few of the people in the very lowest bulgey being ill-natured enough to grieve."
9241,6454-120342-0028.flac, large enough to contain all the good wishes. so away again to the houses of confectioners who had given the children candy.
9242,6454-120342-0033.flac," everywhere, a little crowd gathered round us, and then we dashed away far enough to gather quite another crowd. and then back, perhaps, not sorry to double on our steps if need were, and leaving every crowd with a happy thought of"
9243,6454-120342-0003.flac," howland is always good about such things, knew what the sleigh was for, having done the same in other years, and doubled the span of horses of his own accord, because the children would like it better, and it would be no difference to him."
9244,6454-120342-0013.flac," shepherd of tender sheep, singing with all that unconscious paythos with which children do sing, and starting the tears in your eyes in the midst of your gladness. the instant the horses bell stopped, their voices began."
9245,6454-120342-0015.flac," little did clement think of bells and snow as he taught it in his sunday school there in alexandria. but perhaps today, as they pin up the laurels and the poem in the chapel at alexandria,"
9246,6454-120342-0035.flac," begged that they might stay till the last moment. they could walk back from the stable and rather walk than not, indeed."
9247,6454-120342-0024.flac," though christostom should have made a few remarks to them 17 times in the chapel. then the italian image-man heard for the first time in his life, now is the time of christmas come, and"
9248,6454-120342-0006.flac," and, without fatigue to horse or man. so it was that when i came down with licitous to the chapel at seven o'clock, i found harry had gathered there his eight pretty girls, and his eight jolly boys,"
9249,6454-120342-0012.flac," so, we dashed up to the front of halliburton's palace, where he was keeping his first christmas tie. and the children, whom harry had hushed down for a square or two, broke forth with good full voice under his strong lead in"
9250,6454-120342-0017.flac," halliburton came running out, and begged me to bring them in. but i told him, no, as soon as i could hush their shouts of mary christmas, that we had a long journey before us, and must not a light by the way."
9251,6454-120342-0019.flac," we ran the sleigh into a bank on the slope of pynchney street in front of walter's house, and before they suspected there that anyone had come, the children were singing, carol, carol, christians, carol, joyfully."
9252,6454-120342-0008.flac," or perhaps harry had hinted it to their mothers. certainly they were warmly dressed, and when 15 minutes afterwards, haaland came round himself with a sleigh, he had put in as many rugs and bare skins."
9253,6454-120342-0011.flac," there can be nothing better than two or three such hours. first, driver out on commonwealth avenue, that will tone down the horses. stop on the left after you have passed fairfield street."
9254,6454-120342-0021.flac," and all of them fell in so cheerily. oh, dear me, it is a scrap of old efframe the syrian, if they did but know it. and when, after this, harry would feign have driven on,"
9255,6454-120342-0010.flac," under the full moon, on the snow still white, with sixteen children at the happiest,"
9256,6454-120342-0034.flac," the star, the manger, and the child. at nine we brought up at my house, d. street, three doors from the corner, and the children picked their very best for polly and my six little girls to gear."
9257,6454-120342-0025.flac," jesus and his babes abiding, and then we came up hanover street and stopped under mr. jerry's chapel, where they were dressing the walls with their evergreens and gave them hail to the night, hail to the day."
9258,6454-120342-0018.flac," and the children broke out with, hale to the night, hale to the day. rather a favorite, quicker and more to the childish taste, perhaps than the other, and with another merry christmas we were off again."
9259,6454-120342-0002.flac," should break up the spree before it began. then i had told howland that he must reserve for me a span of good horses, and a sleigh that i could pack sixteen small children into, tight stowed."
9260,6454-120342-0000.flac," hours are not the carolings of your poor shivering little east angles or south mercians, where they have to plod round a foot in countries where they do not know what a sleigh ride is."
9261,6454-120342-0001.flac, i had asked harry to have sixteen of the best voices in the chapel school to be trained to eight or ten good carols without knowing why. we did not care to disappoint them if a february thaw setting in on the 24th of december
9262,6454-120342-0023.flac," and then up the hill and over to the north end, and as far as we could get the horses up into moon court, that they might sing to the italian image-man, who gave lucy the boy and dog in plaster,"
9263,6454-120342-0026.flac," and so down state street, and stopped at the advertiser office, because, when the boys gave their literary entertainment, mr. hale put in their advertisement for nothing. and, up in the old attic there,"
9264,6454-120342-0007.flac," and had them practicing for the last time, carol, carol, christians, carol joyfully, carol for the coming of christ's nativity. i think the children had got inkling of what was coming."
9265,6454-120342-0030.flac," and out on dover street bridge, that the poor chair-mender might hear our carols sung once more before he heard them better sang in another world, where nothing needs mending."
9266,6454-120342-0004.flac," sunday night, as the weather-nymphs ordered, the wind hauled round to the northwest and everything froze hard. monday night, things moderated, and the snow began to fall steadily. so steadily."
9267,6454-120342-0020.flac," kisses flung from the window. kisses flung back from the street. merry christmas again with a good will, and then one of the girls began, when anna took the baby and pressed his lips to hers."
9268,6454-120342-0031.flac," king of glory, king of peace, hear the song and see the star, welcome be thou heavenly king!"
9269,6454-120342-0027.flac," and the in-general man from his more serious views, and the daily the next morning wished everybody a merry christmas with even more function and resolved that in coming years it would have a supplement."
9270,6454-120342-0022.flac," because two carols at one house was the rule, how the little witches begged that they might sing just one song more there, because mrs. alexander had been so kind to them when she showed them about the german stitches."
9271,6454-120342-0032.flac," and all the others, wrung out with order or without order, breaking the hush directly as the horses bells were still thrown into the air with all the gladness of childhood."
9272,6454-120342-0016.flac," they are humming the words, not thinking of climate more than he thought of us. as the children closed with"
9273,6454-120342-0009.flac," as if he thought the children were to be taken new born from their respective cradles. great was the rejoicing as the bells of the horses rang beneath the chapel windows, and harry did not get his last decapoe for his last carol."
9274,6454-120342-0029.flac," to the palaces of millionaires who had prayed for these children with tears if the children only knew it, to dr. frothingham's and summers street, i remember, where we stopped because the boston association of ministers met there."
9275,6454-120342-0014.flac," in an instant more we saw halleberton and anna run to the window and pull up the shades, and in a minute more faces at all the windows, and so the children sang through clements old him."
9276,6454-93938-0011.flac," and when i saw the judge finish off his signature with a flourish, i played a pretty desperate card. you're just too late, gentlemen, i said, pointing out the side window of the saloon. there come the cavalry."""
9277,6454-93938-0030.flac," i was now heading for the station over the ties, and was surprised to see fred cullen, with lord rails, on the tracks up by the special. for my mind had been so busy in the last hour,"
9278,6454-93938-0017.flac," and considering that he had covered over forty miles that afternoon in pretty quick time, it was not surprising that there wasn't very much go left in him."
9279,6454-93938-0019.flac," but i lost sight of them the next moment. as soon as i reached a street leading back to the railroad i turned again, and rode towards it, my one thought being to get back, if possible, to the station,"
9280,6454-93938-0024.flac," that not one of them drew a bead on me. the moment i saw that there was no escape, i put my hand in my breast pocket and took out the letters, intending to tear them into a hundred pieces. but"
9281,6454-93938-0002.flac," to make matters more serious, baldwin had rounded up his cowboys and brought them along with him in order to make any resistance impossible. i made no objection to the sheriff serving the paper,"
9282,6454-93938-0007.flac," on the night of october 14, and ask that he be taken into custody on that charge. i couldn't make out this new move and puzzled over it, while judge wilson ordered my commitment."
9283,6454-93938-0034.flac," intending to write up and run into my car, for i knew that the papers in my hand would be taken to be the wanted letters, and that if i could only get inside the car, even for a moment, the suspicion would be that i had been able to hide them."
9284,6454-93938-0033.flac," afraid to shout anything which should convey the slightest clue as to the whereabouts of the letters, as the next best thing, i pulled a couple of old section reports from my pocket."
9285,6454-93938-0022.flac," in expectation of hearing the shooting begin, and to know that any moment may be your last. i don't suppose i was on the ragged edge more than thirty seconds, but they were enough to prove to me that"
9286,6454-93938-0023.flac," to keep one's back turned to an enemy as one runs away, takes a deal more pluck than to stand up and face his gun. fortunately for me, my pursuers felt so sure of my capture"
9287,6454-93938-0020.flac," and put the letters into the railroad age and safe. when i reached the main street, i saw that my hope was futile. for another batch of cowboys were coming in full gallop towards me, very thoroughly heading me off in that direction."
9288,6454-93938-0015.flac," as only western horses will stand. it didn't take me long to have those brides back in place, and as i tossed each over the peak of the mexican saddle,"
9289,6454-93938-0001.flac," seeing through the device, the party had at once gone to this ranch where the owner, baldwin, mounted them, and it was their dust cloud we had seen as they rode up to ash forks."
9290,6454-93938-0009.flac," this made me feel pretty serious, for the letters were in my breast pocket, and i swore at my own stupidity in not having put them in the station safe when i had first arrived at ash forks."
9291,6454-93938-0008.flac, but the next step revealed the object for the lawyer then asked for a search warrant to look for stolen property. the judge was equally obliging and began to fill one out on the instant.
9292,6454-93938-0021.flac," to escape them, i headed up the street away from the station, with the pack in close pursuit. they yelled at me to hold up, and i expected every moment to hear the crack of revolvers,"
9293,6454-93938-0016.flac," i gave two of the pony slaps, which started them off at a lope across the railroad tracks. i swung myself into the saddle of the third, and flicked him with the loose ends of the bridle in a way which made him understand that i meant business."
9294,6454-93938-0000.flac," what seemed at the moment an incomprehensible puzzle had, as we afterwards learned, a very simple explanation. one of the g.s. directors, mr. baldwin, who had come in on mr. camp's car,"
9295,6454-93938-0018.flac," two hundred feet, therefore, brought me to the edge of the town, and i wheeled my pony and rode down behind the rear of the buildings. in turning, i looked back, and saw half a dozen mounted men already in pursuit."
9296,6454-93938-0014.flac," i grabbed the key and locked them in. when i turned to do so, i saw the lot struggling up from the floor, and knowing that it wouldn't take them many seconds to find their way out through the window,"
9297,6454-93938-0003.flac," and the stars in their courses are against cicera. with the sheriff and mr. camp, i then walked over to the saloon, where judge wilson was waiting to dispose of my case."
9298,6454-93938-0010.flac," there weren't many moments in which to think, while the judge scribbled away at the warrant, but in what time there was, i did a lot of headwork, without, however, finding more than one way out of the snarl."
9299,6454-93938-0032.flac," but before i was within speaking distance, baldwin came running out from behind the station, and, seeing me, turned, called back and gesticulated, evidently to summon some cowboys to head me off."
9300,6454-93938-0028.flac," this put me out a view of my pursuers for a moment, and in that instant i stood up in my stirrups, lifted the broad leather flap of the saddle, and tucked the letters underneath it, as far in as i could force them."
9301,6454-93938-0005.flac," i told wilson i should not produce the letters, and he asked if i knew what that meant. i couldn't help laughing and retorting. it very appropriately means contempt of the court, your honor."
9302,6454-93938-0025.flac," as i did so i realized that to destroy united states mail, not merely entailed criminal liability, but was off-color morally. i faltered,"
9303,6454-93938-0006.flac," seeing that i understood the moves too well to be bluffed, the judge, mr. camp and the lawyer held a whispered consultation. my surprise can be imagined when, at its conclusion, mr. camp said,"
9304,6454-93938-0004.flac," and answered that i asked an adjournment of the case so that i might be heard by counsel. it was denied, as was to have been expected, indeed why they took the trouble to go through the forms was beyond me."
9305,6454-93938-0029.flac," it was a desperate place in which to hide them, but the game was a desperate one at best, and the very boldness of the idea might be its best chance of success."
9306,6454-93938-0027.flac," till i thought that madge wouldn't want me to be dishonest, even for her. i turned across the railroad tracks and cut in behind some freight cars that were standing on a siding."
9307,6454-93938-0035.flac," hide them! fred was quick as a flash, and grabbing them off the ground, sprang up the steps of my car, and ran inside, just escaping a bullet from my pursuers."
9308,6454-93938-0013.flac," as he did so, i gave him a shove towards the three, which sent them all sprawling on the floor in a pretty badly mixed up condition. i made a dash for the door, and as i went through it, i was able to see the door."
9309,6454-93938-0026.flac," balancing the outwitting of camp against state's prison, the doing my best for mange against the wrong of it. i think i'm as honest a fellow as the average, but i have to confess that i couldn't decide to do right."
9310,6454-93938-0012.flac, the three conspirators jumped to their feet and bolted for the window.
9311,6454-93938-0031.flac," that i had forgotten that fred was due. the moment i saw him, i rode towards him, pressing my pony for all he was worth. my hope was that i might get time to give fred the tip as to where the letters were, and that i would be able to see the letters."
9312,5339-14133-0035.flac," as a favorable symptom or otherwise. buy and buy, luckily for him, and some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table, she caught the edge of her work basket and down it fell. she stooped to pick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted."
9313,5339-14133-0041.flac," and then they sat down on the settle together. and when she was more composed, they began to talk. he asked her about her mother, not sorry in his heart at bill robbins' absence."
9314,5339-14133-0032.flac," she did not come forward to meet him. she went crimson to the very roots of her hair, but that in the waning light he could not see. and she shook so that she felt as if she could hardly stand, but the tremor was not visible to him."
9315,5339-14133-0052.flac, he wound up with a chuckle as the thought struck him that this great piece of business of disposing of their only child had been concluded while his wife was away
9316,5339-14133-0018.flac," there is much to be done in foster shop, and later hours were kept than usual. some perplexity or other was occupying john and jeremiah foster."
9317,5339-14133-0056.flac," for a time there was no answer, then a door was unbolted and sylvie said, accounts come down again."
9318,5339-14133-0002.flac," or washing or churning days. her life was quiet and monotonous, although hard working, and while her hands mechanically found and did the recustom labor, the thoughts that rose in her head always centered on charlie kinraid. his ways, his words."
9319,5339-14133-0010.flac," of which she, otherwise occupied, was quite unaware. she liked him better too than she had done a year or two before, because he did not show her any of the eager attention which teased her then, although its meaning was not fully understood."
9320,5339-14133-0005.flac," and to see sylvia. for the two fosters were punctuously anxious to make their shotman test all their statements, insisting on an examination of the stock as if hepburn and colson were strangers to the shop."
9321,5339-14133-0022.flac," i wish i had seen him,"" said colson."
9322,5339-14133-0004.flac, he was very busy with facts and figures.
9323,5339-14133-0051.flac," robson listened to all he said with approving nods and winks, till charlie had told him everything he had to say. and then he turned and struck his broad horny palm into kinrates as if concluding a bargain."
9324,5339-14133-0024.flac," and then my master saw another girl that he liked better. william was choked and is endeavored to keep down all appearance of violent anger in the wind on, and that he played the same game with as at her tail. and how did thysister take it?"
9325,5339-14133-0019.flac, but it thus happened that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render at such times. and colson had been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and philip as future partners.
9326,5339-14133-0017.flac," it was the time of the great half yearly traffic of the place. another impetus was given to business when the whalers returned in the autumn, and the men were flush of money, and full of delight at once more seeing their homes and their friends."
9327,5339-14133-0011.flac," things were much in this state when the frost broke, and milder weather succeeded. this was the time so long looked forward to by the invalid in her friends, as favoring the doctor's recommendation of change of air. her husband was to take her."
9328,5339-14133-0037.flac," you might have forgotten me, and yet i thought we made a bargain against forgetting each other. no answer. he went on. you've never been out of my thoughts, sylvia robson."
9329,5339-14133-0015.flac," conscious of the demand in which they were held at this season of the year, it was wartime too. many captains unable to procure men among shabin would have to complete their crews in the shetlands. the shops in the town were equally busy."
9330,5339-14133-0050.flac," at any rate, it was not unwelcome. he liked kin raid and had strong sympathy not merely with what he knew of the young sailor's character, but with the life he led and the business he followed."
9331,5339-14133-0030.flac," it was read up for the afternoon, covered with a black mass of coal, over which the equally black kettle hung on the crook. in the back kitchen, dolly reed, sylvia's assistant during her mother's absence, chanted a l'gubrius diddy, befitting her condition as a widow."
9332,5339-14133-0028.flac," sylvia sat in the house place, her back to the long, low window, in order to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her work. a basket of her father's unmended stockings was on the little round table beside her."
9333,5339-14133-0045.flac, i shall go to see happy now thinking i've your word. you're not one to go back from it. i'm sure. it's a long time to leave such a pretty girl as you. and now the chance of a letter reaching you. just to tell you once again how i love you.
9334,5339-14133-0026.flac," this fault of his was one with which the two graves, sedate young men, had no sympathy. their hearts were true and constant. whatever else might be their failings. and it is no new thing to dam the faults we have no mind to."
9335,5339-14133-0036.flac," and so did he. and when they rose up, he had fast hold of her hand, and her face was turned away, half ready to cry."
9336,5339-14133-0001.flac," and bill robson, though not getting worse, to not make any progress towards amendment."
9337,5339-14133-0008.flac," perhaps more silent than she had been a year ago. and she did not attend so briskly to what was passing around her. she was rather thinner and paler, but whatever changed there wasn't her was always an improvement in philip's eyes."
9338,5339-14133-0043.flac," had given him the chance of seeing her alone and obtaining her promise to marry him without being obliged to tell either her father or her mother at present. i had spent my money pretty free,"" he said. and i've narrowed a penny to the fore."
9339,5339-14133-0044.flac," and your parents may look for something better for you, my pretty."
9340,5339-14133-0020.flac," one evening after the shop was closed while they were examining the goods and comparing the sales with the entries in the day book, colson's suddenly inquired. by dewey hester, does they know where the possible of the best bandanas has gone? there was four left, as i'm pretty sure when i set off to sansand,"
9341,5339-14133-0049.flac," but she, weary of a subject she cared nothing about, and eager to identify herself with all his interests. asked him about his plans almost at the same time that he said these last words. and they went on as lovers do."
9342,5339-14133-0012.flac," to spend the fortnight with a kindly neighbor who lived near the farm they had occupied 40 miles or so inland before they came to hader's bank. though widow woman was to come and stay in the house, to keep sylvia company during her mother's absence."
9343,5339-14133-0023.flac," why? what's up?"" said philip, surprised at williams' unusual manner, and at the same time rather gratified to find a reflection of his own feelings about kinraid. colson's face was pale with anger."
9344,5339-14133-0025.flac," she died in a six-month said william. she forgived him, but it's beyond me. i thought it were him that i heard of to work about darlie. can't read. and coming from newcastle, where annie lived, prentas, and i made inquiry."
9345,5339-14133-0007.flac," but this, it was evident, would not have satisfied their masters, who were scrupulous and insisting that whatever advantage there was, should always fall on the side of the younger men. when philip saw sylvia, she was always quiet and gentle."
9346,5339-14133-0003.flac," like nancy, and borrowing the poor girl's own words, she would say softly to herself, he once was here. but all along, she believed in her heart he would come back again to her, though it touched her strangely to imagine the agonies of forsaken love."
9347,5339-14133-0000.flac," black and bitter, but welcome enough to the farmers."
9348,5339-14133-0006.flac," by degrees, both hepburn and colson were introduced to distinct manufacturers and wholesale dealers."
9349,5339-14133-0055.flac, an old man like me isn't as good a company as the pretty lass. laughing a low-rich laugh over his own wit. daniel went to the bottom of the stairs and called... siddhavi!
9350,5339-14133-0040.flac, he had not taken two steps when she turned quickly towards him and said something.
9351,5339-14133-0013.flac," daniel, indeed, was to return home after conveying his wife to her destination. but there was so much to be done on the land at this time of the year that sylvia would have been alone all day had it not been for the arrangement just mentioned."
9352,5339-14133-0021.flac, is he here again? set philip? i didn't see him. what brings him here?
9353,5339-14133-0033.flac," the tones, the looks that i accompanied those words, but all she said was, i didn't think to see you."
9354,5339-14133-0038.flac," and i've been your nibbikith no kin as yet. and now that i'm here, you won't speak to me. i don't know what to say."
9355,5339-14133-0031.flac," charlie kinrad and the story of crazy nancy had been the subjects for her dreams for many a day and many a night. now he stood there, bright and handsome as ever, with just that much timidity in his face. that anxiety as to his welcome."
9356,5339-14133-0047.flac, and there is jan tau fellow of a cousin as looks black at me.
9357,5339-14133-0042.flac," he had intended, if necessary, to acknowledge his wishes and desires with regard to sylvia to her parents. but for various reasons, he was not sorry that circumstances."
9358,5339-14133-0014.flac," and yet these must be reached before june, or the year's expedition would be of little avail. every blacksmith shop, wrong with the rhythmical clang of busy hammers, beating out old iron such as horseshoes, nails or stubs, into the great harpoons."
9359,5339-14133-0029.flac," and one was on her left hand, which she supposed herself to be mending. but from time to time she made long pauses, and looked in the fire, and yet there was but little motion of flame, or light in it out of which to conjure visions."
9360,5339-14133-0053.flac," mr. phononos, but she's no on a keen on matrimony."
9361,5339-14133-0054.flac, we invest keep this matter to ourselves till thou comes and port again.
9362,5339-14133-0046.flac," that i'll be none need of that, murmur sylvia. she was too dizzy with happiness to have attended much to his details of his worldly prospects, but at the sound of his tender words of love her eager heart was ready to listen. i don't know."
9363,5339-14133-0009.flac," so long as she spoke graciously to him. he thought she was suffering from long continued anxiety about her mother, or that she had too much to do. and either cause was enough to make him treat her with a grave regard and deference, which had a repressed tenderness in it."
9364,5339-14133-0016.flac," stores had to be purchased by the whaling masters, warm clothing of all sorts to be provided. these were the larger wholesale orders, but many a man and woman too brought out their small hordes to purchase extra comforts, or precious keepsakes for some beloved one."
9365,5339-14133-0039.flac," till i taught her to love me more, but if she's a cold hearted and cannot care for an honest seller, why then i'd better go back at once. he made for the door. he must have been pretty sure from some sign or other, or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to give way."
9366,5339-14133-0034.flac," she felt his eyes were upon her, watching every motion, and grew more and more confused in her expression and behavior. he was a little taken aback by the nature of his reception, and was not sure at first whether to take the great change in her manner."
9367,5339-14133-0027.flac," he had only come that afternoon to monk shaven, and for the sole purpose of seeing sylvia once more before he went to fulfill his engagement as specseneer in the urania, a whaling vessel that was to sail from north shields on thursday morning, and this was monday."
9368,5339-14133-0048.flac, he's a notion of being sweet on your herself. nati said sylvia with some contempt in her tone.
9369,5339-14134-0025.flac," said colson. «luck» said alice, turning sharp-round on him. «never let me hear such a vain word out of thy mouth, laddie, again. it's the lord's doing, and the luck's the devil's way of putting it."
9370,5339-14134-0027.flac," but if that's the frame of mind thou art in, london is liked for it to be a so-a-place authentication. there's pitfalls for men in traps for money in every turn, as i've heard say."
9371,5339-14134-0077.flac," the need for his departure, and yet he stood still for a little time like one entranced, as if his will had lost all power to compel him to leave the place. those two words of hers, which two hours before would have been so far beneath his aspirations,"
9372,5339-14134-0042.flac," he told his uncle that he was bound for london the next day on business, connected with the fosters. daniel was deeply struck with the fact that he was talking to a man, setting off for london at a day's notice."
9373,5339-14134-0033.flac," what's to-do, hesta?"" said he. she lifted up those eyes, usually so soft and serene. now they were full of the light of indignation shining through tears. ""'to do,' she said. carlson. ad thra-batterati."""
9374,5339-14134-0024.flac," to london, exclaimed alice, hester said nothing."
9375,5339-14134-0026.flac," never fret by self-mother about the shirt. said philip, if i need a shirt."
9376,5339-14134-0079.flac," and i'll be home again as soon as ever i can. in half a year such as he forgets, if ever he's thought serious about her, but in my lifetime, if i lived for school, i can never forget."
9377,5339-14134-0008.flac," but to whom they had laterally advanced money. the letters hinted at the utter insolvency of this manufacturer. they had urged their corresponded to give them his name and confidence, and this morning's letter had brought it."
9378,5339-14134-0049.flac, gear in and a and focus talking on a new kind or make and if that's bound for york i'm not going by york. i'm going by a new castle smack no castle
9379,5339-14134-0056.flac," as disturbing her in the one-bless subject of thought in which alone she cared to indulge. well, philip, and what brings you here was her rather ungracious greeting. why, sylvie, i just started to see me."
9380,5339-14134-0010.flac," and was publicly distinguished for his excellent and philanthropic character. but these letters were provocative of anxiety, especially since this morning's post had brought out the writer's full name, and various particulars showing his intimate knowledge of dickinson's affairs."
9381,5339-14134-0051.flac," i reckon to hear from the innuik, i may have less."
9382,5339-14134-0072.flac," dark. the wood fire not gathered together by careful hands, died out into gray ashes. dolly reed had done her work and gone home. there were but philip and sylvia in the house."
9383,5339-14134-0041.flac," and convinced of her great love towards himself had forgotten any previous jealousy of philip. secure and exultant, his broad handsome, weather-browns face was as great a contrast to philip's long, thoughtful, salocontinence."
9384,5339-14134-0036.flac, and yet hughes reproached for the course it was taken.
9385,5339-14134-0059.flac," that she, whom he loved, had asked him to do something for her, and he hadn't neglected it. so anxious to be excused and forgiven, he went on with the apology she cared not to hear. if she had been less occupied with her own affairs, less engrossed with deep feeling."
9386,5339-14134-0044.flac," no, i shant. he replied shortly. liking has not to do with it. i, you do not about it last need. continue daniel musingly."
9387,5339-14134-0048.flac," so they parted, but philip had not gone many steps before his uncle called him back. kin rates slowly loitering on meanwhile."
9388,5339-14134-0031.flac," i'll not deny but at other times i'm pleased at the thought on it. but if i could, i'd change places with thee at this moment. it's far and hockin', said coulson half-mullified and yet not caring to show it. i make no doubt as well and even chance be tricked us to at first."
9389,5339-14134-0070.flac, and to warn you if need were. my mother never bid you to come spy on after me and blame in me for seeing a lad as my feather things were on.
9390,5339-14134-0032.flac," she was playing with her teaspoon, but he could see that she was choking down her tears."
9391,5339-14134-0060.flac," she would have reproached him, if only ingest, for his carelessness. as it was, she scarcely took in the sense of his words."
9392,5339-14134-0071.flac, sylvie. sylvie.
9393,5339-14134-0061.flac," he paused a little. sylvia's galloping thoughts were pulled suddenly up by his silence. she felt that he wanted her to say something, but she could think of nothing besides an ambiguous… well…"
9394,5339-14134-0075.flac," i shall be a long time away. perhaps i may never come back at all."" here he bitterly thought of an unregarded death. say goodbye. no answer. he waited patiently. can she be wearyed out and gone to sleep he wondered? yet once again."
9395,5339-14134-0018.flac," saying it was more than he should require. but they repeated with fresh urgency, their warnings about the terrible high prices of london, till he could only resolve to keep a strict account and bring back all that he did not expend, since nothing but is taking the whole sum would satisfy his employers."
9396,5339-14134-0046.flac," though our ship lay a fortneed of gravesund. kinre now seemed in a hurry, but philip was stung with curiosity to ascertain his movements and suddenly addressed him. ahurge aware in these parts."
9397,5339-14134-0043.flac," nay, said philip, and you're not about it last night. it's not on my doing. going for i'd leave for a haste stayed where i am. you'll like it when once you're there"
9398,5339-14134-0023.flac," as they all set at t and alice rose's house place, philip announced his intended journey."
9399,5339-14134-0009.flac," but the name was totally unknown to them, though there seemed no reason to doubt the reality of either it or the address, the latter of which was given in full."
9400,5339-14134-0028.flac, said carlson. he sent for her.
9401,5339-14134-0047.flac," and sail for the north sea's day after, he turned away and began to whistle, as if he did not wish for any further conversation with his interrogator. philip indeed had nothing more to say to him. he had learned all he wanted to know. i liked a bit goodbye to sylvia, is she at home? he asked of her father."
9402,5339-14134-0020.flac," that great city of london, which from its very inaccessibility 50 years ago, looms so magnificent through the mist of men's imaginations. it is not to be denied that philip felt exultant at the mere fact of going to london. but then again, the thought of leaving sylvia."
9403,5339-14134-0074.flac," sylvie, i'm going away. say goodbye. no answer, not a sound heard. sylvie, a little louder and less hoarsely spoken. there was no reply. sylvie."
9404,5339-14134-0029.flac," ""'philip knows,' said hester, and then somehow her voice failed her and she stopped. philip paid no attention to this half-uddered sentence. he was eager to tell colson as far as he could do so without betraying his master's secret, how many drawbacks there were to his proposed journey."""
9405,5339-14134-0034.flac, going and doubting an indian philip as never did thee in ill turn or said in ill word or thought in ill thought by thee. and sending him away out onto house this last night of all.
9406,5339-14134-0017.flac," while he appeared to listen to all that was said with quiet business-like attention, it was settled that the next morning he was to make his way northwards to harderpool, once he could easily proceed either by land or sea to newcastle, from which place smacks were constantly sailing to london."
9407,5339-14134-0013.flac," and he had only been brought partially to consent to the sending of hepburn by his brothers pledging himself that the real nature of philip's errand should be unknown to any human creature, save them three. as all this was being revealed to philip, he sat apparently unmoved and simply attentive."
9408,5339-14134-0039.flac," he would pour out his love at her feet, not even urging the young girl to make any return or to express the feelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her. he would be patient with her. he could not be patient himself."
9409,5339-14134-0045.flac, before going to see said philip have smiling. nah.
9410,5339-14134-0038.flac," and all the modification on this point, which his judgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart, was that he would watch her words in manor well when he announced his approaching absence. and if in them he read the slightest token of tender regretful feeling,"
9411,5339-14134-0078.flac," and test your pride, maybe, too."
9412,5339-14134-0069.flac," it's where your own mother sylvia has known you had no brother, or anyone to see after you. and yes, so pretty, so pretty sylvia, he continued shaking his head sadly, that men run after you against their will, as one may say."
9413,5339-14134-0004.flac, and where perhaps as full of consideration as to the possible contents of this london letter.
9414,5339-14134-0012.flac," even now jeremiah was ashamed of their want of confidence in one so good. he believed that the information they had received would all prove a mistake, founded on erroneous grounds, if not a pure invention of an enemy."
9415,5339-14134-0053.flac," and she had covertly watched them up the brown field. she sat down to meditate and dream about her great happiness and being beloved by her hero, charlie kenraid. no gloomy dread of his long summer's absence, no fear of the cold."
9416,5339-14134-0055.flac," her lips still warm and redden by his kiss, were just parted in the happy smile when she was startled by the sound of an approaching footstep. a footstep quite familiar enough for her to recognize it, in which was unwelcome now."
9417,5339-14134-0003.flac," with her basket of letters. one of these seemed of a special consequence to the good brothers. they each separately looked at the direction, and then at one another, and without a word they returned with it unread into the parlor shutting the door, and drawing the green silk curtain close, the better to read it in privacy."
9418,5339-14134-0050.flac, can give all requisite information. i.i. said ropsim.
9419,5339-14134-0000.flac," of the number of letters that arrived among shaven, the fosters, shopkeepers, and bankers had the largest share. the morning succeeding the day on which sylvia had engaged herself to kinraid, the fosters seemed unusually anxious to obtain their letters."
9420,5339-14134-0002.flac," and who must have been lairer than ever this morning to judge from the lateness of her coming. although none but the fosters knew the cause of their impatience for their letters, yet there was such tacit sympathy between them and those whom they employed."
9421,5339-14134-0006.flac," it was apparently by john foster's wish that philip had been summoned. jeremiah, the less energetic and decided brother, was still discussing the propriety of the step when philip entered."
9422,5339-14134-0016.flac," philip had the satisfaction of feeling himself employed on a mission which would call out his powers and yet not exceed them. in his own mind, he first saw the instructions of his masters and was silently in advance of john foster's plans and arrangements."
9423,5339-14134-0065.flac," she stooped for something she had dropped and came up red as a rose to be sure, what then? and she eyed him defiantly, though in her heart she trembled she knew not why. what then?"
9424,5339-14134-0015.flac," john perceived that his messenger would exercise penetration and act with energy, while jeremiah was soothed by philip's caution and not hastily admitting the probability of any charge against dickinson. and in giving full weight to his previous good conduct and good character."
9425,5339-14134-0007.flac," that the fosters had for some time received anonymous letters warning them with distinct meaning, though in ambiguous terms, against a certain silk manufacturer in spider fields, with whom they had had straightforward business dealings for many years."
9426,5339-14134-0067.flac," it would willy-coulson as tell to me, as solemn and serious as one man can speak to another."
9427,5339-14134-0063.flac," nothing more, as phillips and stink told him. but he reasoned that first correct impression away, with ingenious sophistry. not to live there. all i need to stay for some time."
9428,5339-14134-0021.flac," of not seeing her for a week, a fortnight. nay, he might be away for a month. for no rash hurry was tomorrow his delegate negotiation, nulled at his heart."
9429,5339-14134-0014.flac," in fact, he was giving all his mind to understanding the probabilities of the case, leaving his own feelings in the background till his intellect should have done its work. he said little, but what he did say was to the point and satisfied both brothers."
9430,5339-14134-0001.flac, several times jeremiah came out of the parlor in which his brother john was sitting in expectant silence and passing through the shop looked up and down the marketplace and search of the old lame woman who was charitably employed to deliver letters.
9431,5339-14134-0037.flac," until he had patiently, with long continuing and deep affection, worked his way into her regard, was set aside during the present walk. he would speak to her of his passionate attachment before he left for an uncertain length of time and the certain distance of london."
9432,5339-14134-0062.flac," almost as if besieging her to show or express some sorrow at a journey, the very destination of which showed that he would be absent for some time. to lannan!"
9433,5339-14134-0022.flac, several times that day as he perceived colson's jealous solanous.
9434,5339-14134-0076.flac," and gablasya, i'm sorry i've x'd you. no reply. with a heavy, heavy heart, he creaked down the stairs, felt for his cap and left the house."
9435,5339-14134-0068.flac," said sylvia, shivering all over with passion."
9436,5339-14134-0035.flac, she hastily got up and left the room.
9437,5339-14134-0052.flac," brunton sells jeez and that's no better. philip promised to do his best and to write word to robson, who satisfied with his willingness to undertake the commission, bait him go on and see if you could not find the last."
9438,5339-14134-0064.flac, suddenly a light shone down into philip's mind. his voice was changed as he spoke next.
9439,5339-14134-0005.flac," a minute ago, philip and he were on a level of ignorance, from which the former was evidently going to be raised. but he soon returned to his usual state of acquiescence in things as they were, which was partly constitutional, and partly the result of his quaker training."
9440,5339-14134-0011.flac," after much perplexed consultation, john had hit upon the plan of sending hepburn to london to make secret inquiries respecting the true character in commercial position of the man whose creditors, not a month ago, they had esteemed it and honored to be."
9441,5339-14134-0054.flac," glittering icebergs bearing mercilessly down on the urania, nor shuddering anticipation of the dark waves of evil import across her mind. he loved her, and that was enough. her eyes looked translike into a dim, glorious future of life."
9442,5339-14134-0057.flac, but she turned it off with assumed lightness. oh yes.
9443,5339-14134-0066.flac," that the half of some silver coin was among the contents thus turned over before the box was locked. but thy mother wouldn't like it, sylvie. he's played false with other lasses. he'll be playing the false some of these days, if thou let some come about thee."
9444,5339-14134-0073.flac," at length, he raised his stiffened body and stood up, dizzy. up the little wooden stairs he went, where he had never been before, to the small square landing almost filled up with the great chest for oat cake. he breathed hard for a minute, and then knocked at the door of sylvia's room."
9445,5339-14134-0030.flac," and the responsibility which had involved and his unwillingness to leave monk shavin,"" he said. colson, i'd give a deal at twer thou that's we're going and not to me. at least there is many a time i'd give a deal."
9446,5339-14134-0019.flac," the latter was silent, brooding over the confidence which philip had apparently received, but which was withheld from him. he did not yet know of the culminating point, a philips proposed journey to london."
9447,5339-14134-0040.flac," they had seen him already, or his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid them. even though one of his purposes and going to hader's bank had been to bid his uncle farewell, kinray took him by surprise from the hearty greeting he gave him."
9448,5339-14134-0058.flac," pensionately, as of anxious to be forgiven. sylvia did not want his pence, did not care for her ribbon, was troubled by his earnestness of manner, but he knew nothing of all that. he only knew..."
9449,4340-15220-0032.flac," and the third swinging forward to a light on his head. i'm going,"" said sam, with calm decision, for this superb array of unknown pleasures priored his soul and made him forget his weight. how will you fix it, aspen?"
9450,4340-15220-0085.flac," advice sam, thinking that great fun."
9451,4340-15220-0025.flac," new great golden manageries, circus and colosseum, will exhibit at berryville, july 4th at 1 and 7 precisely. admission 50 cents children have price."
9452,4340-15220-0065.flac," which hid the king of beasts from his longing sight. that was a cow-moving. don't you be a donkey-bill. when you hear a real roar, you'll shake in your boots,"" said ben, holding up his handkerchief to dry."
9453,4340-15220-0041.flac," smoothing away all objections, for he liked ben, and saw that he wanted to go. no, i won't. i don't like him. he winks at me in grouse when i touch him. what a naughty sigh. remembering how much reason poor sanch had to distrust his tormentor."
9454,4340-15220-0047.flac, whispered fay hoping to make mischief. circus!
9455,4340-15220-0001.flac," tired teacher had dismissed them for eight whole weeks and gone away to rest. the little schoolhouse was shut up. lessons were over, spirits rising fast, and vacation had begun. the quiet town seemed suddenly inundated with children."
9456,4340-15220-0056.flac," and we don't want to walk fast. ben spoke very decidedly, and, taking billy's arm, away they went, leaving poor babin sanch to watch them out of sight, one sobbing, the other whining dismaly."
9457,4340-15220-0070.flac," bab with a face as red as a lobster and streaked with tears, shoes white with dust, play frock torn in the gathers, something bundled up in her apron and one shoe down at the heel as if it hurt her."
9458,4340-15220-0021.flac," they might do for a fat boy if smithers wanted one, sid ben, surveying the stout youth with calm contempt. let's go in swimming, not low for round here if we can't play."
9459,4340-15220-0014.flac," groud sam kitteridge, bitterly resenting the stern edict, which forbade free-born citizens to burn as much gunpowder as i lacked on that glorious day. last year jimmy got his arm blown off when they fired the old cannon."
9460,4340-15220-0092.flac," fishing out several fragments of gingerbread. starving! and bab ate them with such a relish that sam added a small contribution, and ben caught some water for her in his hand, where the little spring bubbled up beside his stone. now."
9461,4340-15220-0076.flac," trying to pull him after her as she trudged on, bound to see the outside of that wonderful tent, even if she never got in. but sancho had heard a soft trip. and with the sudden bound, twitch the strap away, sprang up the bank,"
9462,4340-15220-0090.flac," i'll take care of her. it was very naughty to come, bab. but so long as you did, you needn't worry about anything. i'll see to you, and you shall have a real good time,"" said ben, accepting his responsibilities without a murmur."
9463,4340-15220-0005.flac," the boys took to baseball like ducks to water, and the common was the scene of tremendous battles, waged with much tumult, but little bloodshed. to the uninitiated, it appeared as if these young men had lost their wits."
9464,4340-15220-0022.flac," proposed a red and shiny boy, panting for a game of leapfrog and sandy pond. may as well, don't seem much else to do, side-sam, rising like a young elephant. the others were about to follow."
9465,4340-15220-0095.flac," in a swampy place, coming along, sanch saw something down there, and i went with him, because i thought maybe it was a muskrat, and you'd like one if we could get him."
9466,4340-15220-0072.flac," bab still held the strap, intent on keeping her charge safe, though she lost herself. but her courage seemed to be giving out, as she looked anxiously up and down the road."
9467,4340-15220-0007.flac," as if their lives depended on it. everyone talking in his gruffest tone, bawling at the top of his voice, squabbling over every point of the game, and seeming to enjoy himself immensely, in spite of the heat, dust, uproar."
9468,4340-15220-0079.flac," before ben could quiet them, bab can climbing up the bank with such a funny mixture of fear, fatigue, determination, and relief in her dirty little face."
9469,4340-15220-0058.flac, he could not help feeling that he ought to have asked lee to go and be kinder to bab.
9470,4340-15220-0029.flac," the zebra to be jumping over the seal, the hippopotamus to be lunching off a couple of crocodiles, and lions and tigers to be raining down in all directions with their mouths wide open, and their tails as stiff as that of the famous northumberland house line."
9471,4340-15220-0046.flac," you just catch hold of this and run along home. lock sad chup for an hour until your mother i'm alright."" answered ben, bound to assert his mounting supremacy before his mates. he's going to the circus."
9472,4340-15220-0087.flac," was the prompt answer. but you haven't got any money. oh, i'd ask somebody to pay for me. i'm so little it wouldn't be much."
9473,4340-15220-0009.flac," ben was a promising pupil and made rapid progress. for i, foot, and hand had been so well trained that they did him good service now. and brown was considered a first-rate catcher."
9474,4340-15220-0015.flac," didn't we have a lovely time going for the doctors and getting him home?"" asked another boy, looking as if he felt defrauded of the most interesting part of the anniversary, because no accident had occurred. it ain't going to be fireworks either, unless somebody's"
9475,4340-15220-0013.flac," so they lay about on the grass in the shade of the big elm, languidly discussing the various wrongs and disappointments. it's the meanest fourth i ever saw. can't have no crackers, because somebody's horse got scared last year."
9476,4340-15220-0091.flac," and bound to do the handsome thing by his persistent friend. i thought you would, and bab folded her arms, as if she had nothing further to do but enjoy herself. are you hungry, aspily?"
9477,4340-15220-0093.flac," command had been, giving santa a role in the grass to clean him. babs crept her face till it shone, and, pulling down her apron to wipe it, scattered a load of treasures collected in her walk. some of the dead flowers."
9478,4340-15220-0069.flac," and both suppressed and astonished hello for their stood-babb, waiting for sancho to lap his fill out of the overflowing trough. such a shabby, tired-looking couple as they were,"
9479,4340-15220-0008.flac," and imminent danger of getting eyes or teeth knocked out. thorny was an excellent player, but not being strong enough to show his prowess, he made bend his proxy, and, sitting on the fence, acted as umpire to his heart's content."
9480,4340-15220-0033.flac," just as he used to feel it when his father caught him up to dashing to the ring. foot it with billy, it's only four miles, and we've got lots of time, so we can take it easy. mother won't care if i send word by sigh."
9481,4340-15220-0068.flac," as he looked before he leapt, he beheld his sight which caused him to stare with all his might for an instant. then turned him back in, sang in an eager whisper."
9482,4340-15220-0042.flac," there's bab, she'll do it. come here, sissy, ben wants you, call sam, beckoning to a small figure just purchasing on the fence. down it jumped and came fluttering up."
9483,4340-15220-0048.flac," falling into a state of great excitement at the mere thought of such delight. you couldn't walk four miles, begand been. yes, i could, as easy as not. you haven't got any money. you have. i saw you showing your dollar."
9484,4340-15220-0003.flac," while wishing the young folk well, secretly blessed the man who invented schools. the girls immediately began to talk about picnics, and have them too, for little hats sprung up in the fields like a new sort of mushroom."
9485,4340-15220-0078.flac," licking his face in spite of his struggles, burrowing in his neck with a ticklish nose, snapping at his buttons, and yelping joyfully. as if it was the best joke in the world to play hide and seek for four long miles."
9486,4340-15220-0044.flac," ben spoke without looking up, and affected to be very busy buckling a strap into sanchez color, for the two were so seldom parted that the dog always rebelled. it was a mistake on ben's part, for it was a mistake on ben's part."
9487,4340-15220-0098.flac, and i shouldn't wonder if you'd got poison bab. don't touch it.
9488,4340-15220-0045.flac," while his eyes were on his work, babs were devouring the bill which sam still held."
9489,4340-15220-0060.flac," and planning to do the honors, handsomely to the boys. it was very warm, and just outside of the town, they paused by a wayside watering trough to wash their dusty faces."
9490,4340-15220-0086.flac," what would you have done if you hadn't found us?"" asked billy, forgetting his impatience and his admiration for this plucky young lady. i'd have gone on and seen the circus."
9491,4340-15220-0040.flac," he'll get lost or stolen if i take him, and it's too far to carry him home if you're in a hurry. began ben, persuading himself that this was the true reason why i was delaying. let's sigh take him back. he'll do it for a cent. won't you sigh, proposed billy?"
9492,4340-15220-0062.flac," and, climbing the green bank above, they lay on the grass under a wild cherry tree, munching luxuriously, while they feasted their eyes at the same time on the splendors awaiting them, for the great tent, with all its flags flying,"
9493,4340-15220-0012.flac," unpropitious. thoreny had gone out of town with his sister to pass the day. two of the best players did not appear, and the others were somewhat exhausted by the festivities, which began at sunrise for them."
9494,4340-15220-0082.flac," and sam tried again while ben was getting the dog down in the city on him. now you expect to go to the circus, i suppose. of course i do. ben said he didn't mind paying if i could get there without bothering him, and i have."
9495,4340-15220-0002.flac," all in such a rampant state that busy mothers wondered how they ever should be able to keep their frisky darlings out of mischief. thrifty fathers planned how they could bribe the idle hands to pick berries or rake hay, and the old folks."
9496,4340-15220-0064.flac," i want to have a good go at everything, especially the lions,"" said sam, beginning on his last cookie. i heard him roar just now, and billy stood up to gaze with big eyes at the flapping canvas"
9497,4340-15220-0071.flac," sancho leapt eagerly with his eyes shut. all his ruffles were gray with dust, and his tail hung wearily down, the tassel at half-mast, as if in mourning for the master whom he had come to find."
9498,4340-15220-0063.flac, was visible from the hill. we'll cut across those fields.
9499,4340-15220-0020.flac," and getting a smart wrap across the nose as he failed to perform the feat. much you know about it, old chap. it's hard work i can tell you. that wouldn't suit such a lazy bones. then you are too big to begin."
9500,4340-15220-0000.flac," chapter 13 somebody runs away. school is done, now we'll have fun. sung bab and betty."
9501,4340-15220-0019.flac," and felt some natural regret at descending from so lofty a sphere. catch me cutting away if i had such a chance as that, answer sam, trying to balance his bat on his chin."
9502,4340-15220-0081.flac," i couldn't make him go home, so i had to hold on till he was safe here, else he'd be lost, and then ben would feel bad. the cleverness of that excuse tickled the boys immensely."
9503,4340-15220-0061.flac," and cool off before plunging into the excitement of the afternoon. as they stood refreshing themselves, a baker's cart came giggling by, and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested. a supply of gingerbread was soon bought, and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested. a supply of gingerbread was soon bought, and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested."
9504,4340-15220-0094.flac," bits of moss and green twigs found near bin, and one attracted his attention, a spray of broad, smooth leaves with a bunch of whitish berries on it. where did you get that?"" he asked, poking it with his foot."
9505,4340-15220-0074.flac, and there isn't any other road to the circus seems to me. babs spoke as if the dog could understand an answer.
9506,4340-15220-0043.flac, i want you to take sancho and tell your mother i'm going to walk and maybe won't be back till sundown. miss celia said i might do what i pleased all day. you remember now?
9507,4340-15220-0051.flac," don't you bother. we don't want any girls tagging after us,"" said sam, walking off to escape the annoyance. i'll bring you a role of chikabarri lazindras if you want teas."
9508,4340-15220-0016.flac," barn burns up. don't i just wish there would?"" gloomly responded another youth, who had so rash the indulged in pirate techniques on a former occasion, that her neighbor's cow had been roasted whole."
9509,4340-15220-0053.flac," they never do come to such little towns. you said so, and i think you are very cross, and i won't take care of sanch, so now, cried, bab, getting into a passion yet ready to cry. she was so disappointed."
9510,4340-15220-0010.flac," and garden jackets when not needed, with the air of one of the old guard on judy at the tomb of napoleon. bab also longed to join in the fun, which suited her better than stupid pignings or fussing over dolls."
9511,4340-15220-0018.flac," all in my best talkery. hot as pepper. but good fun looking in at the upper windows, and hearing the women scream when the old thing wagged round, and i made believe i was going to tumble off. said ben."
9512,4340-15220-0038.flac, observing with dignity. i've got money enough to treat the whole crowd if i choose to. which i don't. then come along and have a jolly time with sam and me. we can buy some dinner and get a ride home as lack as not.
9513,4340-15220-0055.flac," girls is such a bother when you want to knock around. no, bab, you can't go. travel right home and don't make a fuss. come along, boys."
9514,4340-15220-0006.flac," for, no matter how warm it was, there they were, tearing about in the maddest manner. jackets off, sleeves rolled up, queer caps flung on anyway, all batting shabby leather balls and catching the same."
9515,4340-15220-0023.flac," tearing down the street like a runaway coat, waving a long strip of paper as he ran. now then, what's the matter?"" demanded ben. as the other came up greeting and puffing, but full of great news."
9516,4340-15220-0096.flac," and with intense interest. no, only a snake, and i don't care for snakes. i picked some of that. it was so green and pretty. thorny likes queer leaves and berries, you know. answered, bab. spetting down her rough locks."
9517,4340-15220-0097.flac," well, he won't like that, nor you either."
9518,4340-15220-0024.flac," panted billy, putting the paper into sam's hand, and serving the crowd with a face of beaming as a full moon. look out for the big show, ritz sam."
9519,4340-15220-0017.flac, i want to give two cents for such a slow-owed place as this. why? last fourth at this time.
9520,4340-15220-0039.flac," said the amyable billy, with a slap on the shoulder, and a cordial grin which made it impossible for bender resist. ""'why do you stop for,' demanded sam, ready to be off, that they might take it easy.'"
9521,4340-15220-0054.flac," i suppose it wouldn't do, hinted billy, with a look from ben to the little girl, who stood winking hard to keep the tears back? of course it wouldn't. i'd like to see her walking eight miles."
9522,4340-15220-0100.flac," not for a day or so, i guess, but it's bad when it does come."
9523,4340-15220-0067.flac," hold on a minute while i get one more drink. buns of dry fodder said sam, rolling over to the edge of the bank and preparing to descend with as little trouble as possible. he nearly went down head first however."
9524,4340-15220-0052.flac," whispered kindhearted billy with a consoling pat on the crown of the shabby straw hat. when the circus comes here, you shall go. certain shore and betty too, said ben, feeling mean while he proposed what he knew was a hollow mockery."
9525,4340-15220-0030.flac," cricky! wouldn't i like to see that?"" said little cyrus faye, devoutly hoping that the cage, in which this pleasing spectacle took place, was a very strong one. you never would. it's only a picture."
9526,4340-15220-0088.flac," i thought of that. i planned how i'd fix it if i didn't find ben. i'd make sanch do his tricks and get a quarter that way. so now, answered, vav. undaunted by any obstacle. i do believe she would."
9527,4340-15220-0066.flac," i wish you'd hurry up, sam. folks are going in now. i see him."" him billy pranced with impatience. for this was his first circus, and he firmly believed that he was going to behold all that the pictures promised."
9528,4340-15220-0027.flac," filled with noble beings and helmets, all playing on immense trumpets. the twenty-four prancing steeds with mains, tails, and feathered heads tossing in the breeze, the clowns, the tumblers, the strong men,"
9529,4340-15220-0050.flac," she isn't my mrs. now. miss celia wouldn't care, and i'm going anyway. do, do take me, ben. i'll be just as good as ever was."
9530,4340-15220-0011.flac," but her heroes would not have her at any price, and she was obliged to contend herself with sitting by thorny, and watching with breathless interest the varying fortunes of our side. a grand match was planned for the fourth of july, but when the club met,"
9531,4340-15220-0049.flac, and you could pay for me and mom would pay it back. can't wait for you to get ready. i'll go as i am. i don't care if it is my old hat and bab jerk did onto her head. your mother wouldn't like it. she won't like you're going either.
9532,4340-15220-0034.flac," answered sam, producing half a dollar, as if such magnificent sums were no strangers to his pocket. come on, brown. you'll be a first-weight fellow to show us round. as you know all the dodges, said billy."
9533,4340-15220-0073.flac," seeing no sign of the three familiar figures she had been following as steadily as a little indian on the war trail. oh, stanch, watch till i do if they don't come along. we must have gone by them somewhere, before i don't see anyone that way."
9534,4340-15220-0004.flac," every hillside bloomed with gay gowns, looking as if the flowers had gone out for a walk. and the woods were full of featherless birds chirping away as blindly as the thrushens, robins and rents."
9535,4340-15220-0036.flac," who felt bitterly toward all mankind at that instant, because he knew there was no hope of his going. say that again and i'll knock your head off, and then faced round with a gesture which caused the other to skip out of reach precipitantly."
9536,4340-15220-0035.flac," anxious to get his money's worth. well, i don't know, began then, longing to go, but afraid mrs. moss would say no if he asked leave. he's afraid, sneered the red-faced boy."
9537,4340-15220-0083.flac," and i'll go home alone. i am afraid, sanch will take care of me if you won't. answered babs, doubtly. what do you suppose your mother will say to you? asked ben, feeling much reproached by her last words."
9538,4340-15220-0028.flac," and the writers, flying about in the air, as if the laws of gravitation no longer existed. but, best of all, was the grand conglomeration of animals, where the giraffe appears to stand on the elephant's back."
9539,4340-15220-0089.flac," he was a smart child, bab, and if i had enough, i'd take you in myself,"" said billy hardley. for, having sisters of his own, he kept a soft place in his heart for girls, especially enterprising ones."
9540,4340-15220-0026.flac," don't forget day in date, age frost manager. while sam read, the other boys had been gloating about the enticing pictures which covered the bill. there was the golden car."
9541,4340-15220-0099.flac," and ben looked anxiously at bab, who felt her chubby face all over, and examined her diny hands with his solemn air, asking eagerly, will it break out on me before i get to the circus?"
9542,4340-15220-0077.flac," and landed directly on ben's back as he lay peeping over. a pill of laughter greeted him, and having got the better of his master and more ways than one, he made the most of the advantage by playfully worrying him as he kept him down."
9543,4340-15220-0080.flac," that the boys could not look awful if they tried. how dare you come after us, miss, demanded sam, as she looked calmly about her and took a seat before she was asked. sanct would come off to ben."
9544,4340-15220-0059.flac," if i'd told her, i'd like to show her round, and she's been real good to me. no use now. i'll take the girls a lot of candy and make it all right."" he tried to settle it in that way, and trudged gailioth."
9545,4340-15220-0075.flac," and, fixing his sharp eyes on the grass above him, gave us a spacious bark. it's only squirrels, don't mind. but come along and be good for i'm so tired, i don't know what to do, side-bab."
9546,4340-15220-0037.flac," he hasn't got any money more likely, observed a shabby youth, whose pockets never had anything in them but a pair of dirty hands. ben calmly produced a dollar bill and waived it defiantly before this doubter."
9547,198-129977-0009.flac," i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brushwood, but these are all lost on me. i know nothing of the picturesque."
9548,198-129977-0011.flac," and is disgusted with pletch pretentions, he affects greater indifference, and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. he is fastidious and will have an anthication of his own. it is very true, said mary ann, that admiration of landscape scenery"
9549,198-129977-0016.flac," mary ann looked with amazement at edward, with compassion at her sister."
9550,198-129977-0022.flac," that it was exactly the shade of her own. edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of mine still more settled. he was particularly grave the whole morning, mary anne severely sent her herself for what she had said."
9551,198-129977-0017.flac," to a new object suddenly engaged her attention. she was sitting by edward and then taking his teeth from mrs. dashwood, his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plate of hair in the center very conspicuous on one of his fingers."
9552,198-129977-0030.flac," edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others, but such of mary ann's expressions had puzzled him before. and when their visitors left them, he went immediately around her and said in a whisper, i've been guessing, shall i tell you my guess?"
9553,198-129977-0005.flac," this was a subject which ensured maryanne's intention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes."
9554,198-129977-0008.flac," the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber."
9555,198-129977-0001.flac," while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. it was evident that he was unhappy. she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection, which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring."
9556,198-129977-0012.flac," it's become a mere jargon. everybody pretends to fill and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picture-esque beauty was. i detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself."
9557,198-129977-0028.flac," what, you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone? i wish it with all my soul, cried sir john, that will be, we're among us again. this and mary ann's blushing gave new suspicions to edward."
9558,198-129977-0027.flac," mrs. jennings enforced the necessity, and she knows, but you may raise a dance, since she, and that will tempt you, miss mary-anne. a dance cried mary-anne impossible, who is to dance? who, why yourselves, and the carries, and the widacres, to be sure?"
9559,198-129977-0007.flac," which ought to be a regular and rugged, and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct, through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give. i call it a very fine country,"
9560,198-129977-0025.flac," but as it was, she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margaret's instruction extended. sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to sign the park the next day or to drink tea within that evening."
9561,198-129977-0010.flac," i'm afraid it is but too true, said marianne, but why should you boast of it? i suspect, said eleanor, that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another, because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel."
9562,198-129977-0014.flac," but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess, i like fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees. i admire them much more if they are tall, straight and flourishing."
9563,198-129977-0021.flac," she was not in a humor, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else. she internally resolved hence forward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt."
9564,198-129977-0031.flac," what do you mean? shall i tell you? certainly. well then, i guess that mr. willow be hunts. marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archeness of his manner, and after a moment silent said,"
9565,198-129977-0003.flac," he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down, and marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to themselves. but before she was halfway upstairs, she heard the parlor door open."
9566,198-129977-0024.flac," that the name of ferrer began with an f, and this prepared a future mine of raylory against the devoted eleanor, which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance, with edward, could have prevented from being immediately sprung."
9567,198-129977-0000.flac," eleanor saw, with great uneasiness, the low spirits of her friend. his visit afforded her, but a very partial satisfaction."
9568,198-129977-0002.flac," but hitherto, the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain, and the reservness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment, what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one."
9569,198-129977-0020.flac, that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne. the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
9570,198-129977-0004.flac, as you are not yet ready for breakfast.
9571,198-129977-0023.flac," before the middle of the day, they were visited by sir john and mrs. jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. with the assistance of his mother-in-law, sir john was not long and discovering."
9572,198-129977-0006.flac," when edward interrupted her by saying, you must not inquire too far, maryanne. remember, i have no knowledge in the pitch-resk, and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars."
9573,198-129977-0019.flac," he colored very deeply and giving a momentary glance at eleanor replied, yes, it is my sister's hair, the setting always casts a different shade on it, you know. eleanor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise."
9574,198-129977-0013.flac," because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning. unconvince, said edward, that you really fill all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to fill."
9575,198-129977-0029.flac, and who his will be said he in a low voice to ms. dashwood by whom he was sitting. she gave him a brief reply.
9576,198-129977-0026.flac," on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he was to engage them for both. you must drink tea with us tonight, said he."
9577,198-129977-0018.flac," but i should have thought her hair had been darker. marianne's spoken considerably what she really felt, but when she saw how much she had painted edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his."
9578,198-129977-0032.flac, hope. i'm sure you will like him.
9579,198-129977-0015.flac, i do not like ruined tattered colleges. i'm not fined of nettles and fissils or heath blossoms. i have more pleasure in a snug farmhouse than a watchtower.
9580,198-209-0015.flac," to show her resentment towards him who could harbor a doubt of it, to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else, she took to herself all the shame of misconduct."
9581,198-209-0032.flac," what could they have to say of her? she failed general tilly did not like her appearance. she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter, rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes. how came mr. thorpe to know your father? was her anxious inquiry?"
9582,198-209-0020.flac, and to reply in a tone which were chained only a little effect of reserve. we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you and our giles street. you were so kind as to look back on purpose.
9583,198-209-0006.flac," at the bottom of the street, however, she looked back again. and then, not at a window, but issuing from the door, she saw miss tildi herself. she was followed by a gentleman, whom catherine believed to be her father, and they turned up towards edgar's buildings."
9584,198-209-0002.flac," and mrs. allen's wavering convictions only made it more doubtful. to milsom street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain her conduct and be forgiven."
9585,198-209-0005.flac," and as she retired down the street, could not withhold one glance at the trying room windows, an expectation of seeing her there."
9586,198-209-0038.flac," lowering his voice. well done, general, said i, i'm quite of your mind."
9587,198-209-0025.flac," and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off, made a point of her being denied. that was all i do assure you."
9588,198-209-0007.flac," catherine, in deep mortification, proceeded on her way. she could almost be angry herself at such angry insuffility, but she checked the resentful sensation. she remembered her own ignorance. she knew not how such an offense as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness."
9589,198-209-0011.flac," on the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of mr. henry tillney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress. the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment, no longer keep her whole attention."
9590,198-209-0036.flac," no him, there are a few people much about town that i do not know. i have met him forever at the bedford, and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room. one of the finest players we have by the buy. and we had a little touch together, though i was almost afraid of him at first."
9591,198-209-0016.flac," or at least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause. the play concluded, the curtain fell, henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained."
9592,198-209-0028.flac," nay, i'm sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were angry. i angry, i could have no right. well, nobody would have thought you had no right to saw your face."" he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play. he remained with them some time."
9593,198-209-0000.flac," mrs. allen said catherine the next morning, will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today? i shall not be easy till i have explained everything. go by all means, my dear, only put on a white gown. miss tilney always wears white."
9594,198-209-0012.flac," every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box, and, for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch henry tilney? without being once able to catch his eye. no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play."
9595,198-209-0004.flac," and with a look which did not quite confirm his words, said that he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out. catherine with a blush of mortification left the house. she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home, and too much offended to admit her."
9596,198-209-0035.flac," in a consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking with, general tillney. he is a finaled fellow upon my soul, stout, active, looks as young as his son. i have a great regard for him, i assure you."
9597,198-209-0001.flac," catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room, that she might inform herself of general tilnese lodgings. for those she believed they were in milson street, she was not certain of the house."
9598,198-209-0024.flac," perhaps you did not know i had been there. i was not within at the time, but i heard of it from eleanor, and she has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such incivility, but perhaps i can do it as well. it was nothing more than that my father—"
9599,198-209-0008.flac," to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety leave, nor to what rigors of ruinous in retrain it might justly make her amenable. dejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theater that night."
9600,198-209-0013.flac, his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes.
9601,198-209-0009.flac, for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home. and in the second.
9602,198-209-0031.flac, was engaged in conversation with general tilney.
9603,198-209-0029.flac," and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away. before they parted, however, he was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible, and, setting aside the misery of his quitting their box,"
9604,198-209-0030.flac," she was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the world. while talking to each other,"
9605,198-209-0018.flac," you must have thought me so rude, but indeed it was not my own fault was at mrs. allen. did not they tell me that mr. tilney and his sister were gone out in a fayoton together? and then what could i do? but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you."
9606,198-209-0023.flac," and dependence on catherine's honor. oh, do not say miss tilney was not angry, cried catherine, because i know she was. for she would not see me this morning when i called. i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after by leaving it. i was hurt, but i was not affronted."
9607,198-209-0003.flac," tripping lightly through the churchyard and resolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family, who she had reason to believe, win a shop hard by. she reached the house without any impediment, looked at the number."
9608,198-209-0037.flac," the odds were five to four against me, and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps whatever was made in this world, i took his ball exactly. but i could not make you understand it without a table. however i did beat him, a very fine fellow, as ritchie said to you."
9609,198-209-0010.flac," to the theater accordingly, they all went. notillnie's appeared to plague or please her. she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked. but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage."
9610,198-209-0019.flac," my dear, you tumble my gown with mrs. allen's reply. her assurance, however, standing soal as it did, was not thrown away. it brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance."
9611,198-209-0026.flac," and meant to make her apology as soon as possible. catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information, yet as something a solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question, thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the gentleman, but mr. tilney,"
9612,198-209-0021.flac," but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk. i never thought of such a thing. but i begged mr. thorpe so earnestly to stop. i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you. now mrs. allen did not—oh, you were not there—but indeed i did. and if mr. thorpe would only have stopped—"
9613,198-209-0027.flac," why were you less generous than your sister? if she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could suppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take offense? me, i take offense."
9614,198-209-0034.flac," when the entertainment was over, thorpe came to assist them in getting out. catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry. and while they waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which had traveled from her heart, almost to the tip of her tongue by asking,"
9615,198-209-0017.flac," and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box. she was right, in a few minutes he appeared."
9616,198-209-0033.flac," as she pointed them out to her companion, he knew nothing about it, but his father, like every military man,"
9617,198-209-0022.flac," i would have jumped out and run after you."" is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration? henry till me at least was not. with a yet sweetish smile he said everything that need to be said of his sister's concern, regret."
9618,198-209-0014.flac," and forced him to hear her explanation. feeling's rather natural than heroic possessed her, instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready-condemnation, instead of proudly resolving, imponious innocence,"
9619,198-126831-0045.flac," uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door. as he did so, clear and sweet, ran out 10 bell-like drives."
9620,198-126831-0025.flac," you'd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic simplicity, trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him, they say it's pitiful to see him. i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story, girl."
9621,198-126831-0037.flac," don't, cradestly, hysterically, don't you go on, don't you say another word, i can't bear it, don't you? the storygirl didn't, but she had said enough."
9622,198-126831-0005.flac," while sicily admitted that willie fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her, if you love me as i love you, no knife can cut our love into. but sarah ray never you breathe this to a living soul."
9623,198-126831-0041.flac," was why and clear against the dark background of spruces. we were woefully tired, but we could not sit down because the grass was wreaking with doom. the family ghost only appears in daylight to the story girl."
9624,198-126831-0030.flac," there we stood in a huddled memorialized group. oh, what an eerie place that orchard was. what shadows, what noises."
9625,198-126831-0026.flac," if i put it off any longer, it will be too late. i'm growing so fast, and olivia says i'll have to wear ankle skirts next summer. if i begin to look grown up, he'll get frightened of me, and then i'll never find out the golden milestone mystery."
9626,198-126831-0032.flac," somebody killed or something like that, you know? nothing like that ever happened in our family. the kings have always been respectable. perhaps it is emily."
9627,198-126831-0028.flac," and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring. when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge, it was the magical mystical time of between lights. after the west was the dapldool glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets,"
9628,198-126831-0040.flac," he was a strange fruit of animal up questing beast. presently the moon rose, but this only made matters worse. the shadows had been still before, now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs. the old house, with its dreadful secret,"
9629,198-126831-0029.flac," and i got back about 15 minutes ago. i sat down on the front doorsteps for a moment, and all at once i heard a bell ringing in the house eight times. i tell you i was scared. i made a bolt for the orchard, and you won't catch me going near the house till your uncle roger comes home."
9630,198-126831-0051.flac, it don't sound a bit like other clocks.
9631,198-126831-0014.flac," i'd like to, side-pulsity, but we'd come home tired and with all the milking to do, you boys better go alone. peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger, you can all go."
9632,198-126831-0012.flac," the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked ant janet's thrifty soul, but that cake, like beauty, was its own excuse. uncle roger ate three slices of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist."
9633,198-126831-0015.flac," i have an idea that a raspberry pie for tomorrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot. accordingly, after tea, we all set off armed with jugs and cups. felicity, thoughtful creature, also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her."
9634,198-126831-0006.flac," cessely, how old must we be before we can have a real bow? but sarah always denied it, so i'm inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself. patty distinguished himself by catching a rat."
9635,198-126831-0019.flac," i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward, said the story girl, dremly, and i think there is a way of getting there too, if we could only find it."
9636,198-126831-0000.flac, friday was a comfortable day in the household of king. everybody was in a good humor. the story girls sparkled through several tales that ranged from the affrites and gins of eastern myth through the piping days of shivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlisle rokdae folks.
9637,198-126831-0039.flac, he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps.
9638,198-126831-0031.flac," well, here's the key, go and see for yourself,"" said peter. flucity had no intention of going and seeing. i think you boys opt to go, she said, retreating behind the defensive sex. you ought to be braver than girls."
9639,198-126831-0050.flac," it's all peter's fault, so i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing."
9640,198-126831-0011.flac," focity tried and had the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe, a gorgeous compound"
9641,198-126831-0021.flac, and that is the tragedy of life. on that day the gates of eden are shut behind them and age of gold is over. henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day. only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again.
9642,198-126831-0033.flac," king's ghost, whispered felix. she never appeared anywhere but in the orchards of the story girl. oh! oh children! isn't there something under uncle alex tree? we peered fearfully through the gloom. there was something, something that wavered and fluttered, advanced, retreated."
9643,198-126831-0044.flac," there's no use asking the meaning of this, i suppose, at uncle roger with the calm of despair. i've gave up trying to fathom you young ones, peter, where's the key? what yarn have you been telling?"
9644,198-126831-0009.flac," the storygirl would box his ears with her fist and say, bless your grey heart, patty, you're a good sort of old rascal. and pat would purr his satisfaction. i used to take a handful of skin on his back, shake him gently and say,"
9645,198-126831-0002.flac," with the highway man on a moonlit heath, and buscook's girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it. and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated,"
9646,198-126831-0052.flac," i wouldn't have said the story girl honestly. i thought it was a bell when i heard it, and the door opened too. let us be fair, felicity."
9647,198-126831-0020.flac, one better day when they seek it.
9648,198-126831-0004.flac," chancing accidentally i vowed over here certain of these secrets, i learned that sarah ray had named an ample for johnny price. and, cessli, truth you live, there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love."
9649,198-126831-0001.flac," she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silk envelope, the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of palestine disguised. as a page, the gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a cronto"
9650,198-126831-0049.flac," i shall tell it, too. i don't care if the joke is as much on myself as anyone. a story is a story, no matter who it's on. but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown-ups always do it. i never will when i'm grown-up. i'll remember better."
9651,198-126831-0053.flac, but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that the disaster full of peas.
9652,198-126831-0043.flac, we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger elided at the front door. he stared at us in the moonlight.
9653,198-126831-0047.flac, and now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death. we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn.
9654,198-126831-0027.flac," do you think he'll ever tell you who alice is? i asked. i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature, but she would tell us nothing more. when the jelly cookies were all eaten, it was high time to be moving homeward."
9655,198-126831-0036.flac," no, it isn't peck bowen. it's something that walks. i know a story about a ghost, said the story girl, the ruling passions strong, even in extremity. it is about a ghost with eyeholes, but no eyes."
9656,198-126831-0008.flac," very few cats have, and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for pottery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon. patti had a finer taste. the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking."
9657,198-126831-0018.flac," who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright. and if you drink of the cup with her, said the storygirl, her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us, you were never seen in the world again, you were whisked straight way to fairland and lived there with the fairy bride,"
9658,198-126831-0038.flac," all at once, something leaped from the bow of a tree and delighted before us, we split the air with the simultaneous shriek."
9659,198-126831-0042.flac," i know who laughed at us awful, but it's better to be laughed at than scared like this."" uncle roger did not come home till nearly ten. never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in that lane."
9660,198-126831-0013.flac," the poor man meant it as a compliment, but felicity, who knew uncle blair was an artist, and had a poor opinion of such fry, looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasn't."
9661,198-126831-0046.flac, we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation. we thought he never would stop.
9662,198-126831-0017.flac," then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring, cold and polluced under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies, and the story girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain quen where a fair white lady dwelt."
9663,198-126831-0010.flac," pat, you've forgotten more than any human being ever knew. and i vow, patty would lick his chops with the light, but to be called a sweet cat. oh, sarah, sarah."
9664,198-126831-0048.flac, i was so frightened. i wouldn't mind if he laughed once and have it done with it.
9665,198-126831-0035.flac," there was not a great deal of comfort in this. we were almost as much afraid of pegboin as we would be of any spectral visions. peter scoffed at the idea. pegboin wasn't in the house before your uncle roger locked it up, and how could she get in afterwards, he said."
9666,198-126831-0024.flac," he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed. the story girl kissed her fingertips, to him with the delightful adacity which was a part of her."
9667,198-126831-0023.flac," as we sat there, the awkward man passed by, with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side. he did not look like an awkward man, there in the heart of the maple woods."
9668,198-126831-0022.flac," they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we want sojourned and from which we must ever more be exiles. the world calls them its singers, impoets, and artists and storytellers."
9669,198-126831-0034.flac," that's only my old apron said, felicity. i hung it there today when i was looking for that white-hands nest. oh, what shall we do? uncle roger may not be back for hours. i can't believe there's anything in the house. maybe it's only a peg bow and suggested dan."
9670,198-126831-0016.flac," a pretty walk through a world of green, whispering bows and spiced sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight. the raspberries were plentiful."
9671,198-126831-0003.flac, sessily and sarah ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine.
9672,198-126831-0007.flac," and being intolerably conceited about it until sarah ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears, then pat sneaked objectively off his tell drooping."
9673,248-130652-0027.flac," extremely well fitted to make a rumpus, she would know what she liked. she doesn't like you, said grandcourt, with the ghost of a smile. perfectly true, said lush, adding again in a markedly sneering tone."
9674,248-130652-0016.flac," grand court, like many others, had two remarkably different voices. hither too, we have heard him speaking in a superficial, interrupted, drawl, suggestive, chiefly, of langer."
9675,248-130652-0019.flac," when he said, perhaps in a lower tone than ever, but with a perceptible edge of contempt. what in the name of nonsense have i to do with miss arrow point and her music?"
9676,248-130652-0022.flac," and the daughter's looks and manners require no allowances, any more than if she hadn't a six-pence. she's not beautiful, but equal to carrying any rank, and she is not likely to refuse such prospects as you can offer her."
9677,248-130652-0002.flac," the still life in the room, which seemed the stiller for its sober antiquated elegance, as if it kept a conscious well-bred silence, unlike the restlessness of vulgar furniture. whether the gentleman were agreeable to each other was less evident,"
9678,248-130652-0035.flac, and a gentleman's dog should be kicked for him. he only said things which might have exposed himself to be kicked if his confident had been a man of independent spirit.
9679,248-130652-0000.flac, chapter xii.
9680,248-130652-0006.flac," he held in his lap a tiny malteased dog with a tiny silver collar and bell, and when he had a hand unused by cigar or coffee cup, it rested on this small parcel of animal warmth."
9681,248-130652-0014.flac," silence for a couple of minutes, then grand courts said. what men are invited here with their wives."
9682,248-130652-0015.flac, then there are mr. hollis and lady flora and the cushats and the gogoffs. rather a ragged lot remarked grand court after a while. why did you ask the gogoffs?
9683,248-130652-0008.flac," who poor thing whimpered interruptedly as if trying to repress that sign of discontent, and at last rested her head beside the appealing paw, looking up with pittiest beceaching. so at least a lover of dogs must have interpreted fetch."
9684,248-130652-0004.flac," gave a vacillating preference first to one gentleman, then to the other. being dogs in such good circumstances that they could play at hunger, and like to be served with delicacies which they declined to put in their mouths. i'll accept fetch."
9685,248-130652-0001.flac," on the second day after the archery meeting, mr. a henley-mallinger grand court was at his breakfast table with mr. lush. everything around them was agreeable."
9686,248-130652-0007.flac," grand court looked at her with unchanged face for half a minute, and then took the trouble to lay down his cigar, while he lifted the unimpassioned fluff close to his chin, and gave it caressing pads, all the while gravely watching fetch."
9687,248-130652-0012.flac," shall you ride or drive to catch him today? i am not going to catch him. you did not go yesterday. grand courts smoked in silence for half a minute and then said,"
9688,248-130652-0018.flac," lush spoke carelessly, but he was really seizing an opportunity and fixing an observant look on grand corde, who now for the first time turned his eyes toward his companion, but slowly and without speaking until he had given too long, luxuriant puffs."
9689,248-130652-0005.flac," the beautiful liver-colored water spaniel, which sat with its forepaws firmly planted and its expressive brown face turned upward, watching grand court with unshaken constancy."
9690,248-130652-0024.flac," and then he said in a deep voice of remmonstrands. good god, grand court, after your experience, will you let a whim interfere with your comfortable settlement in life? spare your oratory. i know what i am going to do."
9691,248-130652-0030.flac," check, old boy. lash being a man of some ability had not known grand court for 15 years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him, though what sort might be useful remained often dubious."
9692,248-130652-0038.flac," since in his own opinion he had never done a bad action, it did not seem necessary to consider whether he should be likely to commit one, if his love of ease required it. lush's love of ease was well satisfied at present."
9693,248-130652-0031.flac," in the beginning of his career, he held a fellowship and was near-taking orders for the sake of a college living, but not being fond of that prospect accepted instead the office of traveling companion to a marquess, and afterward to young grand court."
9694,248-130652-0011.flac, turn out that brute will you said grand court to lash without raising his voice or looking at him as if he counted on attention to the small assign and lasha immediately rose lifted fetch though she was rather heavy
9695,248-130652-0021.flac," that's a pity to fling away an opportunity of this sort and knock down your own plans. your plans, i suppose you mean. you have some debts you know, and things may turn out inconveniently after all."
9696,248-130652-0037.flac," living generally in the most luxuriant, honey-blossomed clover, and all without working, mr. lush had passed for a scholar once, and had still a sense of scholarship when he was not trying to remember much of it."
9697,248-130652-0026.flac," have you fallen in love? this question carried a strong sneer. i am going to marry her. you have made her an offer already then. no. she is a young lady with a will of her own, i fancy."
9698,248-130652-0017.flac," and one of your damned musicians, but not a comic fellow. i wonder if klasmer would consent to come to us when he leaves catch him. nothing but first-class music will go down with miss arrow point."
9699,248-130652-0009.flac," and grandcord kept so many dogs that he was reputed to love them. at any rate, his impulse to act just in that way started from such an interpretation. but when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling bark,"
9700,248-130652-0032.flac," who had lost his father early, and who found lush so convenient that he had allowed him to become prime minister in all his more personal affairs. the habit of fifteen years had made grand court more and more in need of luscious handiness."
9701,248-130652-0036.flac," but what son of a vicar who has stinted his wife and daughters of calico in order to send his male offspring to oxford can keep an independent spirit when he has bent on dining with high discrimination, writing good horses,"
9702,248-130652-0010.flac," that the brute of a cigar required, relighting. fetch having begun to wail, found like others of her sex, that it was not easy to leave off. indeed, the second howl was a louder one, and the third was like unto it."
9703,248-130652-0013.flac," i suppose you sent my card and inquiries. i went myself at four and said you were sure to be there shortly. they would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the intention, especially if you go today."
9704,248-130652-0003.flac," mr. grandcourt had drawn his chair aside so as to face the lawn, and with his left leg over another chair, and his right elbow on the table, was smoking a large cigar, while his companion was still eating. the dogs"
9705,248-130652-0028.flac," however, if you and she are devoted to each other, that will be enough. grand court took no notice of this speech, but sipped his coffee, rose, and strolled out on the lawn, all the dogs following him."
9706,248-130652-0020.flac," you need not give yourself much trouble, perhaps, but some forms must be gone through before a man can marry a million. very likely, but i am not going to marry a million."
9707,248-130652-0033.flac," and lush, more and more in need of the lazy luxury to which his transactions on behalf of grand court made no interruption worth reckoning. i cannot say that the same length and habit had intensified grand courts' want of respect for his companion."
9708,248-130652-0039.flac," and if his puttings were rolled toward him in the dust, he took the inside bits and found them relishing."
9709,248-130652-0025.flac," what? lush put down his cigar and thrust his hands into his side pockets, as if he had to face something exasperating, but meant to keep his temper. i am going to marry the other girl."
9710,248-130652-0023.flac, perhaps not. the father and mother would let you do anything you like with them. but i should not like to do anything with them. here it was lush who made a little pause before speaking again.
9711,248-130652-0034.flac," since that one had been absolute from the beginning, but it had confirmed his sense that he might kick lush if he chose, only he never did choose to kick any animal, because the act of kicking is a compromising attitude."
9712,248-130652-0029.flac," lush glanced after him a moment, then resumed his cigar and lit it, but smoked slowly, consulting his beard with inspecting eyes and fingers, till he finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some conclusion, and said in a subdued voice."
9713,248-130697-0011.flac," she spoke hesitatingly. i had not thought of them,"" said doranda. i was thinking too much of the other things. perhaps you don't quite know the beginning of it all, said gwendolyn, slowly as if she were overcoming her reluctance."
9714,248-130697-0033.flac," you have saved me from worse,"" said gwendolyn, in a sobbing voice."
9715,248-130697-0016.flac," worth anything, worthy enough, i shall always be too wicked to."" the voice broke off helpless. durandas heart was pierced. he turned his eyes on her poor, besieging face and said,"
9716,248-130697-0021.flac," it could never be my impulse to forsake you,"" said doranda promptly, with that voice, which, like his eyes, had the unintentional effect of making his ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it really was."
9717,248-130697-0008.flac," if it were true that he could swim, he must have been seized with cramp. with your quickest utmost effort, it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save him."
9718,248-130697-0025.flac," not till after sir hugo has come. but we shall all go to england. as soon as possible, said duranda, not wishing to enter into particulars."
9719,248-130697-0022.flac, and in that moment he was not himself quite free from a foreboding of some such self-committing effect. his strong feeling for this stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future difficulty.
9720,248-130697-0010.flac," and sooner or later it works its way outside us. it may be in the vitiation that breeds evil acts, but also it may be in the self-apporance that stings us into better striving. i am saved from robbing others."
9721,248-130697-0036.flac, be holding a possible life which she had sinned herself away from.
9722,248-130697-0015.flac," if you did not know how miserable i was, you might. but now it has all been no use. i can care for nothing but saving the rest from knowing. poor mama."
9723,248-130697-0029.flac," before my mother comes,"" said gwendolyn. ah, i must be changed. i have not looked at myself. should you have known me?"" she added, turning toward him. if you had met me now?"
9724,248-130697-0035.flac," he rose as he spoke, and she gave him her hands submissively. but when he had left her, she sank on her knees in hysterical crying. the distance between them was too great."
9725,248-130697-0000.flac," all things are changes, not into nothing, but into that which is not at present. marcus aurelius."
9726,248-130697-0017.flac," i believe that you may become worthyer than you have ever yet been, worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing. no evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love and desire to continue in."
9727,248-130697-0026.flac, gwendolyn looked toward the window again with an expression which seemed like a gradual awakening to new thoughts. the twilight was perceptibly deepening.
9728,248-130697-0006.flac," presently, he heard her cry imploringly. you will not say that anyone else should know?"" most decidedly not, said duranda. there is no action that ought to be taken in consequence."
9729,248-130697-0005.flac," and again turned with the same expression, which yet did not issue in speech. there was some fear hindering her, and duranda, wishing to relieve her timidity, averted his face."
9730,248-130697-0030.flac," should you have known me for the one you saw at laran?"" yes, i should have known you, said deranda mournfully. the outside change is not great. i should have seen at once that it was you, and that you had gone through some great sorrow."
9731,248-130697-0018.flac," and make no effort to escape from. you have made efforts. you will go on making them. but you were the beginning of them. you must not forsake me, sudgwendolin leaning with her clasp tans on the arm of her chair and looking at him."
9732,248-130697-0013.flac," but then we became poor all at once, and i was very miserable, and i was tempted. i thought, i shall do as i like and make everything right. i persuaded myself, and it was all different. it was all dreadful."
9733,248-130697-0001.flac," deeds are the pulse of time, his beating life and righteous or unrighteous being done, must throb in afterthrobs till time itself be laid in darkness."
9734,248-130697-0032.flac," we must find our duties in what comes to us, not in what we imagine might have been. if i took to foolish wishing of that sort, i should wish, not that i had never seen you, but that i had been able to save you from this."
9735,248-130697-0009.flac," that momentary murderous will cannot, i think, have altered the course of events. its effect is confined to the motives in your own breast. within ourselves our evil will is momentous."
9736,248-130697-0019.flac," while her face bore pitius traces of the life experience concentrated in the 24 hours. that new, terrible life, flying on the other side of the deed which fulfills a criminal desire. i will bear any pendants."
9737,248-130697-0028.flac," when you are among your friends again, you will discern new duties,"" said duranda. make it a task now to get as well and calm, as much like yourself as you can, before he hesitated."
9738,248-130697-0023.flac," to an indefinite hope. anxieties, both immediate and distant, crowded on his thought, and it was under their influence that after a moment's silence, he said."
9739,248-130697-0012.flac," there was someone else he ought to have married, and i knew it, and i told her i would not hinder it. and i went away. that was when you first saw me."
9740,248-130697-0024.flac," and i am not without hope that mrs. davilo may shortly follow him. her presence will be the greatest comfort to you. it will give you a motive to save her from unnecessary pain. yes, yes, i will try. and you will not go away."
9741,248-130697-0031.flac," don't wish now that you had never seen me. don't wish that."" said gwendolyn imploringly while the tears gather. i should despise myself for wishing it said doranda. how could i know what i was wishing?"
9742,248-130697-0007.flac," but if i had not had that murderous will, that moment, if i had thrown the rope on the instant, perhaps it would have hindered death? no, i think not, said doranda slowly."
9743,248-130697-0003.flac," and the light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open. she was seated gazing fixively on the sea, resting her cheek on her hand, looking less shattered than when he had left her, but with a deep melancholy in her expression,"
9744,248-130697-0027.flac," or else it dip-low? i am quite uncertain where i shall live,"" said doranda coloring. she was warned by his changed color that she had spoken too rashly and fell silent."
9745,248-130697-0002.flac, and the universe quiver and breathe upon no mirror more. in the evening she sent for him again. it was already near the hour at which she had been brought in from the sea the evening before.
9746,248-130697-0004.flac," which as duranda approached her, passed into an anxious timidity. she did not put out her hand, but said. how long ago it is? then, will you sit near me again a little while?"
9747,248-130697-0034.flac," it will be better for me to go now,"" said duranda, worn in spirit by the perpetual strain of this scene. remember what we said of your task. to get well and calm before other friends come."
9748,248-130697-0014.flac, then came hatred and wicked thoughts. that was how it all came. i told you i was afraid of myself.
9749,248-130697-0020.flac," i will lead any life you tell me, but you must not forsake me. you must be nearer. if you had been near me, if i could have said everything to you, i should have been different. you will not forsake me?"
9750,248-130644-0035.flac," for macbeth's rhetoric about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the same moment, referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to the subtler possibilities of feeling. we cannot speak a loyal word and be meanly silent."
9751,248-130644-0021.flac," for subjects are apt to appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old, but she would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had turned up in conversation. it must be remembered that no one had disputed her power or her general superiority."
9752,248-130644-0026.flac," always she was the princess in exile, who in time of famine was to have her breakfast roll made of the finest bolted flower from the seventh in years of wheat, and in a general decampment was to have her silver fork kept out of the baggage."
9753,248-130644-0006.flac," that she was to be married sometime or other, she would have felt obliged to admit, and that her marriage would not be of a middling kind, such as most girls were contented with, she felt quietly, unargumentatively sure."
9754,248-130644-0028.flac," a decision of will which made itself felt in her graceful movements and clear, unhesitating tones, so that if she came into the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the use of things in general was not apparent to them,"
9755,248-130644-0010.flac," she could not look forward to a single life, but promotions have sometimes to be taken with bitter herbs. a period will not quite do instead of leadership to the men who meant to lead. and this delicate limb silt of twenty meant to lead."
9756,248-130644-0020.flac," who can wonder if gwendolyn felt ready to manage her own destiny. there were many subjects in the world, perhaps the majority, in which she felt no interest because they were stupid."
9757,248-130644-0004.flac," and he did not even think of getting a too frisky horse in order that gwendolyn might be threatened with an accident and be rescued by a man of property. he wished his niece well, and he meant her to be seen to advantage in the best society of the neighborhood."
9758,248-130644-0002.flac," it is rather to be set down to his credit that his feelings on the subject were entirely good-natured, and in considering the relation of means to ends, it would have been mere folly to have been guided by the exceptional and idyllic."
9759,248-130644-0022.flac," what will gwendolyn think. if the footman trod heavily in creaking boots, or if the launders' work was unsatisfactory, the maid said, this will never do for miss harleth."
9760,248-130644-0015.flac, the archery club and invitations to dine with the arrow points as the highest lights in her scenery was not a position that seemed to offer remarkable chances. but gwendolyn's confidence laid chiefly in herself.
9761,248-130644-0011.flac," for such passions dwell in feminine breasts also. in gwendolyn's, however, they dwelt among strictly feminine furniture and had no disturbing reference to the advancement of learning or the balance of the constitution."
9762,248-130644-0014.flac," but would make the very best of the chances that life offered her, and conquer circumstances by her exceptional cleverness."
9763,248-130644-0030.flac," this potent charm added to the fact that she was the eldest daughter, toward whom her mama had always been, in an apologetic state of mind, for the evils brought on her by a stepfather, may seem so full a reason for gwendolyn's domestic empire."
9764,248-130644-0034.flac," the fear and the fondness being perhaps both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her character. the play of various, nay contrary tendencies."
9765,248-130644-0025.flac," it was always she herself who had to be tolerant. to beg that alice who sat waiting on her would not stick up her shoulders in that frightful manner, and that isabel, instead of pushing up to her and asking questions, would go away to miss mary."
9766,248-130644-0007.flac, but her thoughts never dwelt on marriage as the fulfillment of her ambition. the dramas in which she imagined herself a heroine were not brought up to that close. to be very much sued or hopelessly sidelined for as a bride was indeed
9767,248-130644-0031.flac, that to look for any other would be to ask the reason of daylight when the sun is shining. but beware of arriving at conclusions without comparison.
9768,248-130644-0001.flac," why should he be expected to differ from his contemporaries in this matter, and wish his niece a worse end of her charming maidenhood than they would approve as the best possible?"
9769,248-130644-0003.flac," in order that a marquee might fall in love with her, or to have insisted that since a fair maiden was to be sought, she should keep herself out of the way. mr. gasquans' calculations were of the kind called rational."
9770,248-130644-0017.flac," in the school room, her quick mind had taken readily that strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts, which saves ignorance from any painful sense of limpness."
9771,248-130644-0036.flac, we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment.
9772,248-130644-0000.flac," it would be a little hard to blame the rector of pentecost. that in the course of looking at things from every point of view, he looked to gwendolyn as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage."
9773,248-130644-0018.flac," and what remained of all things knowable, she was conscious of being sufficiently acquainted with through novels, plays, and poems. about her french and music, the two justifying accomplishments of a young lady, she felt no ground for uneasiness."
9774,248-130644-0016.flac," she felt well-equipped for the mastery of life. with regard to much in her lot, hither too, she held herself rather hardly dealt with, but as to her education, she would have admitted that it had left her under no disadvantages."
9775,248-130644-0005.flac," her uncle's intention fell in perfectly with gwendolyn's own wishes, but let no one suppose that she also contemplated a brilliant marriage as the direct end of her witching the world with her grace on horseback or with any other accomplishment."
9776,248-130644-0033.flac," some of them were a very common sort of men, and the only point of resemblance among them all was a strong determination to have what was pleasant, with a total fearlessness in making themselves disagreeable or dangerous when they did not get it."
9777,248-130644-0032.flac," whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful or euphonious way, and who were not eldest daughters with attendor, timid mother, compunctious at having subjected them to inconveniences."
9778,248-130644-0024.flac," if, when they were under the stress of traveling, she did not appear at the breakfast table till everyone else had finished, the only question was, how gwendolyn's coffee and toast should still be of the hottest and crispest?"
9779,248-130644-0019.flac," and when to all these qualifications, negative and positive, we add the spontaneous sense of capability some happy persons are born with, so that any subject they turn their attention to impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on it,"
9780,248-130644-0012.flac, her knowledge being such as with no sort of standing room or length of lever could have been expected to move the world. she meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking manner.
9781,248-130644-0023.flac," if the wood smoked in the bedroom fireplace mrs. davilo, whose own weak eye suffered much from this inconvenience, spoke apologetically of it to gwendolin."
9782,248-130644-0009.flac," in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum. of course marriage was social promotion."
9783,248-130644-0029.flac, there seemed to be a sudden sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life. and even the waiters at hotels showed the moral acrity in doing away with crumbs and creases and dregs with struggling flies in them.
9784,248-130644-0027.flac," how was this to be accounted for? the answer may seem to lie quite on the surface. in her beauty, a certain unusualness about her."
9785,248-130644-0008.flac, an indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power. but to become a wife and where all the domestic fetters of that condition was on the whole of exacious necessity. her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state
9786,248-130644-0013.flac, and to have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in which no will was present. it was not to be so with her. she would no longer be sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself.
9787,196-122150-0019.flac," how this one had an easy billet in japan somewhere, and that one was doing well in the siamese navy, and in all they said, in their actions and their looks, in their persons, could be detected the soft spot, the place of decay."
9788,196-122150-0040.flac," held on her steadfast way black and smoldering in illumina-semensity, as if scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity."
9789,196-122150-0017.flac," had preserved an undefeased energy with the temper of buccaneers in the eyes of dreamers. they appeared to live in a crazy maze of plans, hopes, dangers, enterprises, ahead of civilization in the dark places of the sea."
9790,196-122150-0030.flac," the strong men at the head of family parties, the lean old men pressing forward without hope of return. young boys with fearless eyes, glancing curiously, shy little girls with tumbled long hair."
9791,196-122150-0039.flac," such were the days, still, hot, heavy, disappearing one by one into the past, as if falling into an abyss forever open in the wake of the ship. and the ship, lonely under a wisp of smoke,"
9792,196-122150-0025.flac," and when clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck, flowed forward and aft, overflowed down the yawning hatchways, filled the inner recesses of the ship, like water filling a cistern."
9793,196-122150-0032.flac," said the german skipper to his new chief mate. an arab, the leader of that pious voyage, came last. he walked slowly aboard, handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban. a string of servants followed loaded with his luggage."
9794,196-122150-0028.flac," meeting strange sights beset by strange fears upheld by one desire. they came from solitary huts in the wilderness, from populist campongs, from villages by the sea. at the call of an idea,"
9795,196-122150-0012.flac," played cards a little, or yawning, and in pajamas, lounge through the day in easy chairs without saying a word. the hospital stood on a hill, and a gentle breeze entering through the windows, always flung wide open."
9796,196-122150-0022.flac," she was owned by a chinaman, chartered by an arab, and commanded by a sort of renegade new south wales, german. very anxious to curse publicly his native country, but who, apparently, on the strength of bismarck's victorious policy?"
9797,196-122150-0020.flac," the determination to lounge safely through existence. to jim, that gossiping crowd, viewed as seamen, seemed at first more unsubstantial than so many shadows, but at length he found a fascination in the sight of those men,"
9798,196-122150-0004.flac," that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice, with a strength beyond control, with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and his fear."
9799,196-122150-0018.flac," had remained as officers of country ships. they had now a horror of the home service with its harder conditions, severe review of duty, and the hazard of stormy oceans. they were attuned to the eternal peace of eastern sky and sea,"
9800,196-122150-0024.flac," they streamed aboard over three gangways. they streamed in, urged by faith, and the hope of paradise. they streamed in with a continuous tramp and shuffle of bare feet, without a word, a murmur, or a look back."
9801,196-122150-0038.flac," the awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern, and a faint hum, a low murmur of sad voices, alone revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean."
9802,196-122150-0016.flac," he associated naturally with the men of his calling in the port. these were of two kinds. some, very few and seen there but seldom, led mysterious lives."
9803,196-122150-0006.flac," disabled by a falling spar at the beginning of a week of which his scottish captain used to say afterwards, man, it's a perfect miracle to me how she lived through it. spent many days stretched on his back. days, battered, hopeless."
9804,196-122150-0015.flac," lighted by festel sunshine, it ships like toys, its brilliant activity, resembling a holiday pageant, with the eternal serenity of the eastern sky overhead, and the smiling piece of the eastern seas,"
9805,196-122150-0011.flac," afflicted by some mysterious tropical disease, who held the doctor for an ass, and indulged in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which is tamil servant used to smuggle in with unweary devotion. they told each other the story of their lives,"
9806,196-122150-0007.flac," and tormented as if at the bottom of an abyss of unrest. he did not care what the end would be, and in his lucid moments overvalued his indifference. the danger, when not seen, has the imperfect vagueness of human thought."
9807,196-122150-0026.flac," like water flowing into crevices and crannies, like water rising silently even with the rim. 800 men and women with faith and hopes, with affections and memories they had collected there."
9808,196-122150-0029.flac," they had left their forests, their clearings, the protection of their rulers, their prosperity, their poverty, the surroundings of their youth, and the graves of their fathers. they came covered with dust, with sweat, with grime, with rags."
9809,196-122150-0001.flac," he knew the magic monotony of existence between sky and water. he had to bear the criticism of men, the exactions of the sea, and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread, but whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work."
9810,196-122150-0002.flac," the edge of his temper, and the fiber of his stuff, that revealed the quality of his resistance, and the secret truth of his pretenses, not only to others, but also to himself."
9811,196-122150-0034.flac," its eye of flame as if in derision of her errand of faith. she cleared the strait, crossed the bay, continued on her way through the one degree passage. she held on strait for the red sea under a serene sky."
9812,196-122150-0031.flac," the timid women muffled up and clasping to their breasts, wrapped in loose stand of soiled head claws, their sleeping babies, the unconscious pilgrims, of an exacting belief."
9813,196-122150-0037.flac," glided past on his descent, and sank mysteriously into the sea, evening after evening, preserving the same distance ahead of her advancing boughs. the five whites on board lived amid ships, isolated from the human cargo."
9814,196-122150-0003.flac," there are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales, and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intention that indefinable something which forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man"
9815,196-122150-0021.flac," in their appearance of doing so well on such a small allowance of danger and toil. in time, beside the original disdain, there grew up slowly another sentiment, and suddenly, giving up the idea of going home,"
9816,196-122150-0023.flac," brutalized all those he was not afraid of, and wore a blood and iron air, combined with a purple nose and a red mustache. after she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside, 800 pilgrims more or less,"
9817,196-122150-0000.flac, chapter 2
9818,196-122150-0035.flac," enveloped in a fulger of sunshine that killed all thought, oppressed the heart, withered all impulses of strength and energy. and under the sinister splendor of that sky, the sea, blue and profound, remains still, without a stir."
9819,196-122150-0027.flac," coming from north and south, and from the outskirts of the east. after treading the jungle paths, descending the rivers, coasting in prowls along the shallows, crossing in small canoes from island to island, passing through suffering,"
9820,196-122150-0033.flac," and on the secret purposes of their hearts. the steamer pounded in the dusk the calm water of the straight, and far a stern of the pilgrimship, a screwpile lighthouse, planted by unbelievers on a treacherous shawl, seemed to wink at her,"
9821,196-122150-0009.flac," and then the unintelligent brutality of an existence liable to the agony of such sensations filled him with a despairing desire to escape at any cost. then fine weather returned, and he thought no more about it."
9822,196-122150-0036.flac," without a ripple, without a wrinkle, viscous, stagnant, dead. the patna, with a slight hiss, passed over that plain, luminous and smooth, unrolled a black ribbon of smoke across the sky,"
9823,196-122150-0010.flac," his lameness, however, persisted, and when the ship arrived at an eastern port, he had to go to the hospital. his recovery was slow, and he was left behind."
9824,196-122150-0014.flac," jim looked every day over the thickets of gardens beyond the roofs of the town, over the fronds of palms growing on the shore, at that road-stead, which is a thoroughfare to the east. at the road-stead, dotted by garlanded islands,"
9825,196-122150-0005.flac," the sunshine, the memories, the future, which means to sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by the simple and appalling act of taking his life. jim"
9826,196-122150-0008.flac," he lay there batten down in the midst of a small devastation, and felt secretly glad he had not to go on deck. but now and again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip him bodily."
9827,196-122150-0013.flac," brought into the bear room the softness of the sky, the langer of the earth, the bewitching breath of the eastern waters. there were perfumes in it, suggestions of infinite repose, the gift of endless dreams."
9828,196-122159-0003.flac," of the sword you like to imagine yourself to have been. of the sword whose appearance claims the fellowship of these illusions you had thought gone out extinct, cold, and which, as if rekindled at the approach of another flame,"
9829,196-122159-0029.flac," i wanted it. it is the very thing i wanted. there. do you think you or anybody could have made me if i- i am- i am not afraid to tell, and i wasn't afraid to think either. i looked it in the face."
9830,196-122159-0024.flac," a hair's breadth, he muttered. not the breadth of a hair between this and that. and at the time, it is difficult to see a hair at midnight, i put in."
9831,196-122159-0026.flac," keep up the illusion of my beginnings, as though he had robbed our common life of the last spark of its glamour. and so you cleared out at once. jumped. he corrected me insisively. jumped mind."
9832,196-122159-0007.flac," glitter of the vast surface, which is only a reflection of his own glances full of fire. there is such a magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had driven each of us to the sea. such a glorious indefiniteness,"
9833,196-122159-0010.flac," hadn't we all commenced with the same desire, ended with the same knowledge, carried the memory of the same cherished glamour through the sorted days of implication? what wonder that when some"
9834,196-122159-0019.flac," i interjected. i would have meant to be, he retorted, and that's more than i meant when i—he shivered as if about to swallow some nauseous drug."
9835,196-122159-0017.flac," how much more did you want?"" i asked. but i think i spoke so low that he did not catch what i said. he had advanced his argument as though life had been a network of"
9836,196-122159-0023.flac, men have been known to float for hours in the open sea and be picked up not much the worst for it. i might have lasted it out better than many others. there's nothing the matter with my hawk.
9837,196-122159-0002.flac," like this, he said. it does me good. you don't know what it is to me. you don't... words seem to fail him. it was a distinct glimpse. he was a youngster of the sort you'd like to see about you."
9838,196-122159-0022.flac," now you understand why i didn't after all. didn't go out in that way. i wasn't going to be frightened at what i had done. and anyhow, if i had stuck to the ship, i would have done my best to be saved."
9839,196-122159-0018.flac," his voice sounded reasonable. suppose i had not. i mean to say, suppose i had stuck to the ship. well, how much longer? say a minute. half a minute."
9840,196-122159-0021.flac," i ought to have known. i am a gentleman too. yes, yes, i said hastily. he was looking me squarely in the face and withdrew his gaze slowly."
9841,196-122159-0009.flac," in no other kind of life is the illusion more wide of reality. in no other is the beginning all illusion, the disenchantment more swift, the subjugation more complete."
9842,196-122159-0004.flac," you don't know what it is for a fellow in my position to be believed. make a clean breast of it to an elder man. it is so difficult, so awfully unfair, so hard to understand."
9843,196-122159-0015.flac," and was placated by the sound of a faint sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird in the night. well, i wasn't, he said courageously. it was something like that wretched story they made up. it was not a lie."
9844,196-122159-0000.flac," at his back was the dark night with the clear stars whose distant glitter, disposed in retreating planes, lured the eye into the depths of a greater darkness."
9845,196-122159-0001.flac," and yet a mysterious light seemed to show me his boyish head, as if in that moment the youth within him had, for a moment, glowed and expired. you are an awful good sort to listen."
9846,196-122159-0031.flac," but i knew the truth, and i would live it down, alone with myself. i wasn't going to give in to such a beastly unfair thing. what did it prove after all? i was confoundedly cut up, sick of life."
9847,196-122159-0011.flac," heavy prad gets home, the bond is found to be close. that besides the fellowship of the craft, there is felt the strength of a wider feeling, the feeling that binds a man to a child. he was there before me, believing that"
9848,196-122159-0030.flac," i wasn't going to run away. at first, at night, if it hadn't been for those fellows, i might have—no, by heavens. i was not going to give them that satisfaction. they had done enough. they made up a story. and believed it for all i know."
9849,196-122159-0027.flac," he repeated, and i wondered at the evidence but obscure intention. well, yes, perhaps i could not see then, but i had plenty of time in any amount of light in that boat, and i could think too."
9850,196-122159-0016.flac, but it wasn't truth all the same. it was something. one knows a downright lie. there was not the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and the wrong of this affair.
9851,196-122159-0032.flac," no, the proper thing was to face it out alone for myself. wait for another chance."
9852,196-122159-0012.flac," and he had been deliberating upon death, can't found him. he had found that to meditate about, because he thought he had saved his life, while all its glamour had gone with the ship in the night. what more natural?"
9853,196-122159-0008.flac," it's such a beautiful greed of adventures that are their own and only reward. what we get, well we won't talk of that, but can one of us restrain a smile."
9854,196-122159-0020.flac," he pronounced with a convulsive effort whose stress is if propagated by the waves of the air made my bodies stir little in the chair. he fixed me with lowering eyes. don't you believe me, he cried? i swear."
9855,196-122159-0013.flac," and his voice spoke. i was so lost, you know. it was the sort of thing one does not expect to happen to one. it was not like a fight, for instance."
9856,196-122159-0025.flac," a little viciously, i fear. don't you see what i mean by the solidarity of the craft? i was aggrieved against him as though he had cheated me."
9857,196-122159-0005.flac," the mists were closing again. i don't know how old i appeared to him, and how much wise. not half as old as i felt just then, not half as uselessly wise as i knew myself to be."
9858,196-122159-0028.flac," nobody would know, of course, but this did not make it any easier for me. you've got to believe that, too. i did not want all this talk. no! yes. i won't lie."
9859,196-122159-0006.flac," surely, and no other craft is in that of the seed, or the hearts of those already launched to sink or swim, go out so much to the youth on the brink, looking with shining eyes upon that."
9860,196-122159-0014.flac," he appeared changed as if he had suddenly matured. one couldn't be sure,"" he muttered. ""'ah, you were not sure,' i said."""
9861,196-122152-0032.flac," harbored a silent listener. now and then a small red glow would move abruptly, and, expanding, light up the fingers of a languid hand, part of a face, and profound repose, or a flash of crimson gleam into a pair of pensive eyes."
9862,196-122152-0006.flac, clean-shaped and impassable looked at him deadly pale between the red faces of the two nautical assessors. the light of a broad window under the ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men.
9863,196-122152-0021.flac," felt a shiver run down his back. the big assessor had dropped his eyelids, and drummed on without a sound, careless and mournful. the eyes of the other above the sunburnt, clasped fingers,"
9864,196-122152-0031.flac," and audibly. perhaps it would be after dinner, on a veranda draped in motionless foliage, and crowned with flowers, in the deep dusk speckled by fiery cigar-ends. the elongated bulk of each cane chair,"
9865,196-122152-0023.flac," he rested his temple in the palm of his hand. the wind of the punkas eddyed down on the heads, on the dark face natives wound about, in voluminous draperies. on the europeans sitting together very hot,"
9866,196-122152-0008.flac," looking at jim with thoughtful blue eyes. the other, a heavy, scornful man thrown back in his seat. his left arm extended full length, drummed delicately with his fingertips on a blotting pad. in the middle, the magiostrate,"
9867,196-122152-0014.flac," stopped the engines instead of making a row about it on deck. i heard him say, get up, run, fly! he swore also. the engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine-room companion."
9868,196-122152-0016.flac, who wanted facts. after his first feeling of revolt he had come round to the view that only a meticulous precision of statement would bring out the true horror behind the appalling face of things.
9869,196-122152-0025.flac," rested upon a white man who sat apart from the others, with his face worn and clouded, but with quiet eyes that glanced straight, interested and clear. jim answered another question and was tempted to cry out"
9870,196-122152-0018.flac, perdition that dwelt within like a malevolent soul in a detestable body. he was anxious to make this clear. this had not been a common affair. everything in it had been of the utmost importance.
9871,196-122152-0011.flac," i knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship, but the collision bulkhead separating the four-peak from the four-hold. i went back to tell the captain. i came upon the second engineer, getting up at the foot of the bridge ladder. he seemed dazed and..."
9872,196-122152-0001.flac, and the official inquiry was being held in the police court of an eastern port. he stood elevated in the witness box with burning cheeks in a cool lofty room.
9873,196-122152-0017.flac," the facts, those men were so eager to know, had been visible, tangible, open to the senses, occupying their place in space and time, requiring for their existence a 1400 ton steamer"
9874,196-122152-0022.flac, the magistrate had swayed forward.
9875,196-122152-0004.flac," for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast, came to him poignant and silent."
9876,196-122152-0005.flac," outside the court, the sun blazed. within was the wind of great punkas that made you shiver, the shame that made you burn, the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed. the face of the presiding magistrate,"
9877,196-122152-0013.flac," he did not strike him again, he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low."
9878,196-122152-0012.flac," told me he thought his left arm was broken. he had slipped on the top step when getting down while i was forward. he exclaimed, my god, that rotten bulkhead will give way in a minute."
9879,196-122152-0029.flac," like a prisoner alone in his cell, or like a waferer, lost in a wilderness. at present he was answering questions that did not matter, though they had a purpose, but he doubted whether he would ever again speak out as long as he lived."
9880,196-122152-0002.flac," the big framework of punkas moved gently to and fro high above his head. and from below, many eyes were looking at him out of dark faces, out of white faces, out of red faces, out of faces attentive, spellbound."
9881,196-122152-0027.flac," it was an act of intelligent volition. jim, between two questions, forgot himself so far as to find leisure for a thought. this fellow ran the thought, looks at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder."
9882,196-122152-0026.flac," what's the good of this? what's the good?"" he tapped with his foot slightly, bit his lip, and looked away over the heads. he met the eyes of the white man. the glance directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others."
9883,196-122152-0024.flac," and in drill suits that seem to fit them as close as their skins, and holding their round pith hats on their knees. while gliding along the walls, the court-pions, button-tight and long white coats, flitted rapidly too and fro,"
9884,196-122152-0028.flac," he had come across that man before in the street perhaps. he was positive he had never spoken to him. for days, for many days he had spoken to no one, but it held silent, incoherent, and endless converse with himself."
9885,196-122152-0007.flac," as if facts could explain anything. after you had concluded you had collided with something floating a wash, say a water-logged wreck, you were ordered by your captain to go forward and ascertain if there was any damage done."
9886,196-122152-0033.flac," overshadowed by a fragment of an unruffled forehead, and with a very first word uttered, marlowe's body, extended at rest in the seat, would become very still, as though his spirit had wamed its way back into the laps of time."
9887,196-122152-0030.flac," the sound of his own truthful statements confirmed his deliberate opinion that speech was of no use to him any longer. that man there seemed to be aware of his hopeless difficulty. jim looked at him, then turned away."
9888,196-122152-0000.flac," he said, speaking of the ship, she went over whatever it was as easy as a snake crawling over a stick. the illustration was good. the questions were aiming at facts."
9889,196-122152-0003.flac," as if all these people sitting in orderly rows upon narrow benches had been enslaved by the fascination of his voice. it was very loud, it rang, startling in his own ears. it was the only sound audible in the world."
9890,196-122152-0010.flac," his fingers played incessantly, touching the paper without noise. i did not think of danger just then. i might have been a little startled. all this happened in such a quiet way, and so very suddenly."
9891,196-122152-0019.flac," and, fortunately, he remembered everything. he wanted to go on talking for truth's sake, perhaps for his own sake also. and while his utterance was deliberate, his mind positively flew round and round the serrated circle of facts."
9892,196-122152-0020.flac," he seemed calm enough, only he stumbled several times, and once as i stood speaking to him, he walked right into me as though he had been stone blind. he made no definite answer to what i had to tell."
9893,196-122152-0009.flac," i was told to call no one, and to make no noise for fear of creating a panic, i thought the precaution reasonable. i took one of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward. after opening the four-peak hatch, i heard splashing in there."
9894,196-122152-0015.flac," which was on the port side, moaned as he ran. he spoke slowly. he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness. he could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the better information of these men."
9895,2002-139469-0055.flac," now only the sound of wailing and misery is heard. the air is in poisoned and each human being in hell's death. even while in youth and health, their hopes are in the flower."
9896,2002-139469-0079.flac," while starvation did its accustomed work, thousands died un-lamented. for beside the yet warm corpse, the mourner was stretched, made mute by death."
9897,2002-139469-0103.flac," if they had now enjoyed what they before called a necessary, the ease of a carriage. chairs, as in olden time, and indian palanquins were introduced for the infirm."
9898,2002-139469-0022.flac," but when any whole nation becomes the victim of the destructive powers of exterior agents, then indeed man shrinks into insignificance. he fills his tenure of life insecure."

9901,2002-139469-0035.flac," which even added a chance to our escape. these were questions of prudence. there was no immediate necessity for an earnest caution. england was still secure, france."

9924,2002-139469-0034.flac," these reflections made our legislators pause before they could decide on the laws to be put in force. the evil was so widespread, so violent and immeasurable that no care, no prevention, could be judged superfluous."
9925,2002-139469-0050.flac," in vain, our protector and his partisans sought to conceal this truth. in vain, day after today, he appointed a period for the discussion of the new laws concerning hereditary rank and privilege."
9926,2002-139469-0093.flac," our castle became an asylum for the unhappy. a little population occupied its halls. the revenue of its possessor, which had always found a mode of expenditure, congenial to his generous nature,"

9972,2002-139469-0063.flac, marble halls and infinite wealth is now a tomb. the tent of the arab is fallen in the sands and his horse spurns the ground and bridled and unsaddled. the voice of lamentation fills the valley of kashmir.
9973,2002-139469-0011.flac," ocean is thy slave. thou sweepest over the earth and oaks the growth of centuries, submit to thy viewless acts. the snow drift is scattered on the pinnacles of the alps."
9974,2002-139469-0056.flac," we called to mind the plague of 1348 when it was calculated that a third of mankind had been destroyed. as yet, western europe was uninfected. would it always be so?"
9975,2002-139469-0081.flac," when anyone met a friend in the street, he only cried as he hurried on. you know, while the other, with any ejaculation of fear and horror, would answer."
9976,2002-139469-0000.flac," some disorder had surely crept into the course of the elements, destroying their benignant influence. the wind, prince of air, raged through his kingdom, lashing the sea into fury."
9977,2002-139469-0064.flac," its delves and woods, its cool fountains and gardens of roses are polluted by the dead. in circassia and georgia, the spirit of beauty weeps over the ruin of its favorite temple, the form of woman."
9978,2002-139469-0048.flac, he had sought this office with eagerness under the idea of turning his whole forces to the suppression of the privileged borders of our community.
9979,2002-139469-0112.flac," comitants. winter was hailed, a general and never failing physician."
9980,2002-139469-0084.flac," we were as a man who hears that his house is burning and yet hurries through the streets, born along by a lurking hope of a mistake."
9981,2002-139469-0046.flac," quito was destroyed by an earthquake. mexico laid waste by the united effects of storm, pestilence and famine. crowds of immigrants inundated the west of europe."
9982,2002-139469-0025.flac, and the impediments to their progress yielded at their touch. could we take integral parts of this power and not be subject to its operation? could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast?
9983,2002-139469-0076.flac, the blow was struck. the aristocracy obtained all they wished and they subscribed to a 12-month bill which levied 20% on all the rent roles of the country.
9984,2002-139469-0008.flac," the clouds become thin and arc is formed forever rising upwards. till the universal coat being unveiled, the sung pours forth its rays, reanimated and fed by the breeze."
9985,2002-139469-0072.flac, and these were his vowed enemies. he must conciliate them by abandoning his favorite scheme of equalization. he must confirm them.
9986,2002-139469-0013.flac," they flourish, nursed by thee. why does thou howl thus a wind, by day and by night, for four long months thy roarings have not ceased? the shores of the sea are strewn with wrecks,"
9987,2002-139469-0009.flac, then mighty art thou a wind to be thrown above all.
9988,2002-139469-0001.flac," and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience. the god sends down his angry plagues from high, famine and pestilence in heaps they die, again, in vengeance of his wrath he falls."
9989,2002-139469-0003.flac," their deadly power shook the flourishing countries of the south and during winter, even we in our northern retreat, begin to quake under their ill effects."
9990,2002-139469-0059.flac," perchance, some stricken, asiatic."
9991,2002-139469-0069.flac, and the cape of good hope plague raged.
9992,2002-139469-0040.flac, we must quake. she could take out her globe.
9993,2002-139469-0005.flac, and unginial when the sleeping wind has a woke in the east or when the done clouds thickly veil the sky
9994,5463-39174-0043.flac," if i could only do something for my poor grace. in answer to this mrs. robard said a word or two but not much. she resolved, however, that if she could get her husband's leave, something should be done for grace."
9995,5463-39174-0000.flac," at the end of the last chapter, we left lucy robart's waiting for an introduction to mrs. crawley, who was sitting with one baby in her lap while she was rocking another who lay in a cradle at her feet. mr. crawley, in the meanwhile, had risen from his seat with his finger between the leaves of an old grammar"
9996,5463-39174-0022.flac," lucy found it very difficult to keep up a conversation with mr. crawley. the more so as mrs. robarts and mrs. crawley presently withdrew into a bedroom, taking the two younger children with them. how unlucky, thought lucy, that she has not got my muff with her."
9997,5463-39174-0030.flac," had been attracted by the sound of sugarplums in spite of the irregular verbs. lucy withdrew her hand from her mouth and looked guilty. once she not deceiving the good man, nay teaching his own children to deceive him?"
9998,5463-39174-0017.flac," oh, certainly, bob, my child."
9999,5463-39174-0008.flac," that horace and the irregator greep verbs savored too much of prokoso's forcing in a young lady of nine years old. but nevertheless grace was a pretty simple-looking girl, and clung to her ally closely, and seemed to like being fondled."
10000,5463-39174-0039.flac," oh no, i could not punish you for your goodness in that way. but he would not go. he could go and leave me at home, sometimes i have thought that it might be so, and i have done all in my power to persuade him. i have told him that if he could mix once more with the world, with the clerical world, you know."
10001,5463-39174-0002.flac," the realities of life had become so stern to her that the outward aspects of them were as nothing. she would have liked a new gown because it would have been useful, but it would have been nothing to her if all the county knew that the one in which she went to church had been turned three times."
10002,5463-39174-0026.flac," whispered into his ear that he was wanted. it was the time of day at which his attendants was always required in his parish school, and that attendance being so punctually given, those who wanted him looked for him there at this hour, and if he were absent, did not scruple to send for him."
10003,5463-39174-0031.flac," but there are men made of such stuff that an angel could hardly live with them without some deceit. ""'papa's gone now,' whispered bobby. i saw him turn around the corner.' he at any rate had learned his lesson, as it was natural that he should do."
10004,5463-39174-0015.flac," what is that, bob?"" said mr. crawley. gingerbread? fultured bobby? feeling that a sin had been committed, though, probably feeling also that he himself could hardly as yet be accounted as deeply guilty. miss robart said the father, we are very much obliged to."
10005,5463-39174-0049.flac, how false is his pride and how false is shame? but we must remember what he has to bear. it is not everyone that can endure such a life as his without false pride and false shame. but she has neither said lucy.
10006,5463-39174-0027.flac," miss robartz, i'm afraid you must excuse me,"" said he, getting up and taking his hat and stick. lucy begged that she might not be at all in the way, and already began to speculate how she might best unload her treasures."
10007,5463-39174-0019.flac," this was very discouraging to lucy. if one small bag of gingerbreadnuts created so great a difficulty, how was she to dispose of the part of guava jelly in box of bombons which were still in her mouth? or how distribute the packet of oranges with which the pony carriage was laden?"
10008,5463-39174-0046.flac," and moreover, the gingerbread had been taken down in the audacity of their commercial speculations, and the nats were spread out upon a board behind which lucy stood as shock girl, disposing of them for kisses. mamama, mamama said bobby, running up to his mother. he was by something of her."
10009,5463-39174-0028.flac," and then, stick in hand, he walked forth, and lucy fancy that bobby's eyes immediately rested on the bag of gingerbread nuts. bob said she almost in a whisper."
10010,5463-39174-0044.flac," and was it not incumbent upon her to make some kindly use of all the goods with which providence had blessed herself? and then they went back to the sitting room, each again with a young child in her arms."
10011,5463-39174-0003.flac," it galled him, however, to think that he and his were so poorly dressed. i am afraid you can hardly find a chair miss robards, said mr. crawley."
10012,5463-39174-0016.flac, but our children are hardly used to such things.
10013,5463-39174-0012.flac," looking up for a moment from the anxious discussion in which she was already engaged with mrs. crawley on nursery matters. pray tell him, said mr. crawley, that i shall be happy to see him."
10014,5463-39174-0040.flac," that he would be better fitted for the performance of his own duties. but he answers me angrily that it is impossible, that his coat is not fit for the dean's table. and mrs. crawley almost blushed as she spoke of such a reason. what? with an old friend like dr. airebin?"
10015,5463-39174-0013.flac," his new duties do not disturb him much as yet, said lucy, and his riding over here will be no trouble to him. yes, there he has the advantage over me. i, unfortunately, have no horse."
10016,5463-39174-0047.flac," and he pointed with his fingers at the shopgirl. you must give her two kisses for that heap of barney sugar. looking at bobby's mouth at the time, one would have said that his kisses might be dispensed with. when they were again in the pony carriage behind the impatient puck and were well away from the door,"
10017,5463-39174-0020.flac," and there was jelly for the sick child, and chicken broth, which was indeed another jelly. and to tell the truth openly, there was also a joint of fresh pork and a basket of eggs from the family-parsonage farm yard, which mrs. robart was to introduce, should she find herself capable of doing so."
10018,5463-39174-0025.flac," it was on lucy's tongue to say that her leadership was pretty nearly as bad, but she stopped herself. at this moment providence sent great relief to miss robards in the shape of mrs. crawley's red armed maid of all work. who, walking up to her master,"
10019,5463-39174-0024.flac," mark thinks that as he is so near he need not be much absent from framely, even during his residence, and then lady lofton is so good about the schools. ah yes, but lady lofton is not a clergyman, miss robards."
10020,5463-39174-0010.flac," yes, i have heard of it, said mr. crawley gravely. i hope that his promotion may tend in every way to his advantage here and hereafter. it seemed, however, to be manifest from the manner in which he expressed his kind wishes"
10021,5463-39174-0045.flac," lucy had been engaged the while with the children, and when the two married ladies entered, they found that a shop in bed opened at which all manner of luxuries were being readily sold and purchased at marvelously easy prices. the guava jelly was there, the oranges and the sugar plums, red and yellow and striped."
10022,5463-39174-0033.flac," i did venture to bring them, said fanny, with a look of shame, for i know how a sick child occupies the whole house. ah, my friend, said mrs. crawley, taking hold of mrs. robart's arm and looking into her face. that sort of shame is over with me."""
10023,5463-39174-0014.flac," then lucy began petting the little boy and by a degree slipped a small bag of gingerbread nuts out of her muff into his hands. she had not the patience necessary for waiting as had her sister-in-law. the boy took the bag, peeped into it, and then looked up to her face."
10024,5463-39174-0042.flac," but such a friend must be equal, not only in mind, but in purse, and where can he ever find such a man as that? but you may get better, preferment. ah, no. and if he did, we are hardly fit for it now. if i could think that i could educate my children,"
10025,5463-39174-0029.flac," i've left a book behind me, he said, and coming back to the room, he took up the well-worn pair book which accompanied him in all his wanderings through the parish. bobby, when he saw his father, had retreated a few steps back, as also did grace, who, to confess the truth."
10026,5463-39174-0011.flac," that his hopes and expectations did not go hand in hand together. by the by, he desired us to say that he would call here tomorrow. at about 11, didn't he say, fanny? yes."
10027,5463-39174-0035.flac," such things are so much worse for a man than for a woman. fanny was not quite prepared to admit this in her own heart, but she made no reply on that head. i am sure i hope we may be able to be of use to you, she said, if you would only look upon me as an old friend and write to me if you want me."
10028,5463-39174-0036.flac," to feel herself so different from the wise if other clergymen around her, to know that they lived softly while she, with all the work of her hands and unceasing struggle of her energies, could hardly manage to place wholesome food before her husband and children. it was a terrible thing, a grievous thing to think of,"
10029,5463-39174-0018.flac," and then the bag and a solemn man who was carried over to their mother who, taking it from her son's hand, laid it high on his bookshelf. and not one now said lucy robards very piteously? don't be so hard, mr. crowley, not upon them, but upon me."
10030,5463-39174-0001.flac," for she had work of this kind of her own at home, which she by no means neglected, though the attendance of nurses was more plentiful with her than at hoggelstock. mrs. crawley did get up and told lucy that she was glad to see her, and mr. crawley came forward, grammar and hand, a looking humble and meek."
10031,5463-39174-0032.flac," someone else also had learned that papá was gone. for wild bobbin grace we're still counting the big lumps of sugar candy, each employed the wild for inward solace with an inch of barley sugar. the front door opened and a big basket and a bundle done up in a kitchen cloth."
10032,5463-39174-0034.flac," god has tried us with want, and for my children's sake i am glad of such relief. but will he be angry? i will manage it. dear mrs. robards, you must not be surprised at him. his law is sometimes very hard to bear."
10033,5463-39174-0005.flac," and are you a great scholar as lucy drawing the challenge to her? i don't know, said grace, with a sheepish face. i am in greek delectus and the irregular verbs. greek delectus and the irregular verbs. and lucy put up her hands with astonishment."
10034,5463-39174-0006.flac," and she knows a note of horace all by heart, sidbob. an oat of horace, said lucy, still holding the young, shame-faced female projety close to her knees. it is all that i can give them, said mr. crowley apologetically."
10035,5463-39174-0023.flac," but the mufflay and her lap ponders with its rich enclosures. i suppose you will live in barchester for a portion of the year now, so mr. crawley? i really do not know as yet. mark talks of taking lodgings for his first month's residence."
10036,5463-39174-0048.flac," fanny was the first to speak. how very different those two are, she said, different in their minds and in their spirit. but how much higher tone does her mind than his? how weak he is in many things, and how strong she is in everything?"
10037,5463-39174-0041.flac," but what can i do? i fear that he regards the riches as his enemies. he is pining for the solace of some friend to whom he could talk, for some equal, with a mind educated like his own, to whose thoughts he could listen, and to whom he could speak his own thoughts."
10038,5463-39174-0037.flac," that all the work of her mind should be given up to such subjects as these. but nevertheless, she could bear it, she said, as long as he would carry himself like a man and face his lot boldly before the world. and then she told how he had been better there at hogglestock than in their former residence down in cornwall."
10039,5463-39174-0038.flac," mrs. airb been told me that she was so anxious you should go to them, and mrs. robards. i.s. but that i fear is impossible. the children you know, mrs. robards."
10040,5463-39174-0050.flac," because you have one hero in a family, does that give you a right to expect another sin mrs. robards? of all my own acquaintance, mrs. crawley i think comes nearest to heroism. and then they pass by the hogglestock school, and mr. crawley, when you heard the noise of the wheels, came out."
10041,5463-39174-0007.flac," a little scholarship is the only fortune that has come in my way, and i endeavour to share that with my children. i believe men say that it is the best fortune any of us can have, said lucy, thinking however in her own mind."
10042,5463-39174-0009.flac," so that lucy anxiously wished that mr. crawley could be got rid of in the presence produced. i hope you have left mr. robards quite well, said mr. crawley with a stiff, ceremonial voice."
10043,5463-39174-0004.flac," moving a pile of ragged, coveredless books onto the table, i hope you'll forgive me for moving them. they're not bobs, at least not the most of them, but mine said the girl. but some of them are mine said the boy, ain't they grace?"
10044,5463-39174-0021.flac," but which would certainly be cast out with utter scorn by mr. crawley if tendered in his immediate presence. the herd also be in a suggestion as to adding two or three bottles of port, but the courage of the ladies had failed them on that head, and the wine was not now added to their difficulties."
10045,5463-39173-0030.flac," the mistress of such a destiny, what more or what better could the world have done for her? and now she had thrown all that aside because she would not endure that lady laughed and she'd call her a scheming art for girl. actuated by that fear, she had repulsed him with a falsed,"
10046,5463-39173-0051.flac," therefore, i shall not be satisfied if they become men and wife. however,"
10047,5463-39173-0026.flac, but what would the world come to if none but absolute true heroes were to be thought worthy of women's love? what would the men do? and what? or what would become of the women?
10048,5463-39173-0034.flac," we're going to drive over to hogglestock this morning, fanny said one day at back this. i suppose mark you won't go with us?"
10049,5463-39173-0059.flac, lucy had never seen mrs. crowley. these visits to hogglestock were not frequent and had generally been made by lady lafte and mrs. robards together.
10050,5463-39173-0055.flac," and the scanty comfort of their improved, though still wretched income, had done something towards bringing her back to the world, in which she had lived in a soft days of her childhood. but even the liberal stipend of 130 pounds a year,"
10051,5463-39173-0046.flac," there is, i believe, nothing in her mentally, whatever may be her more lexelences. to me, she is more absolutely like a statue than any other human being i ever saw. to sit still and be admired is all that she desires, and if she cannot get that,"
10052,5463-39173-0056.flac," liberal, according to this scale by which the incomes of clergymen and some of our new districts are now apportioned. would not admit of a gentleman with his wife and four children living with the ordinary conference of a nardison's family."
10053,5463-39173-0010.flac," i suppose i shall have to go into residence almost immediately,"" said mark, recurring to the more agreeable subject of the stall."
10054,5463-39173-0008.flac," and that the purchasing of a hunter with a view of immediately selling him again was, to say the least of it, an operation hardly congenial with the usual taste and pursuits of a clergyman. i hope you did not give very much money for him, mark, said fanny."
10055,5463-39173-0014.flac," it was now the month of april, and the fields were beginning to look green, and the wind had got itself out of the east and was soft and genial, and the early spring flowers were showing their bright colors in the parsnitz garden, and all things were sweet and pleasant."
10056,5463-39173-0016.flac," atoning to his own conscience for past shortcomings by present zeal. and then, though she had never acknowledged it to herself, the absence of her dear friend lady lofton was perhaps in itself not disagreeable. mrs. robards did love lady lofton hardily."
10057,5463-39173-0037.flac," well, lucy, we must drive ourselves, that's all. you shall be charioteer going and then we'll change coming back. to all which, lucy agreed, and as soon as their work in the school was over, they started."
10058,5463-39173-0043.flac," whether lord lofton likes her. i think he does in a sort of way. he did not talk to her so much as he did to you. ah, that was all lady lofton's fault, because she didn't have him properly labeled."
10059,5463-39173-0049.flac," if he were your brother, you could not be more eager about it. no, i could not. he's the only man friend with whom i was ever intimate, and i cannot bear to think that he should throw himself away. it's horribly improper to care about such a thing, i have no doubt."
10060,5463-39173-0039.flac," as to make her sister-in-law quite sure that there had been no love passages up to that time. and nothing had since occurred which had created any suspicion in mrs. robart's mind. she had seen at once that all the close intimacy between them was over, and thought that everything was as it should be."
10061,5463-39173-0001.flac," indeed, after what mr. soarby had said, and after lord lofton's ascend to it, it would have been madness he considered to decline it. and then, too, mr. soarby's promise about the bills was very comfortable to him. after all,"
10062,5463-39173-0060.flac," almost as penitent as secured himself. then they would walk together for hours along the rock-bound shore, listening to the waves, discussing deep polymerical mysteries, sometimes with hot fury, then again with tender, loving charity."
10063,5463-39173-0038.flac," not a word had been spoken between them about lord lofton since that evening, now more than a month ago, on which they had been walking together in the garden. lucy had so demeaned herself on that occasion."
10064,5463-39173-0058.flac," as for her own raiment, the wives of few artisans would have been content to put up with mrs. crawley's best gown. the stuff of which it was made had been paid for by her mother when she with much difficulty bestowed upon her daughter her modest wedding to so."
10065,5463-39173-0029.flac, but a title and an estate that in income are matters which will weigh in the balance with all leaves daughters as they do with all adam's sons. pride of place and the power of living well in front of the world's eye are dear to us all. our doubtless intended to be dear.
10066,5463-39173-0004.flac," the enjoyment of one's own happiness at such when falls depends so much on the free and freely expressed enjoyment of others. lady lofton's congratulations and nearly made him throw up the whole thing, but his wife smiles re-encouraged him."
10067,5463-39173-0031.flac, though the matter was one on which it was so terribly expedient that she should tell the truth. and yet she was cheerful with her brother and sister-in-law.
10068,5463-39173-0020.flac," haste and superhuman efforts and men running to and fro with blank acceptances in their hands could alone stave off the crack of doom. but at other times, when retaliatory applications were made to him,"
10069,5463-39173-0022.flac," mark could not bring himself to say that he would pay nothing until the bills were safe. and therefore, with the assistance of mr. forest of the bank, he did remit the price of dandy to his friend sourby in london. and lucy robards."
10070,5463-39173-0011.flac," the house will not be furnished, willett mark, said his wife. i don't know how he shall get on. don't frighten yourselves. i shall take lodgings and barge us, dear."" and we shall not see you all the time, said mrs. robards, with this may."
10071,5463-39173-0048.flac," but i shall indeed be surprised if he wishes it also."" and then, as she finished her speech, lucy again flogged the pony. this she did in vexation because she felt that the tal-tailed blood had suffused her face. why lucy?"
10072,5463-39173-0012.flac," but the prebendry explained that he would be backwards and forwards at family every week, and that in all probability he would only sleep at barchester on the saturdays and sundays, and perhaps not always then."
10073,5463-39173-0003.flac, the income was already his own.
10074,5463-39173-0018.flac," dandy was rather a thorn in his side. those wretched bills were to come due early in may, and before the end of april sorby wrote to him saying that he was doing zatmos to provide for the evil day."
10075,5463-39173-0050.flac," i shall not be satisfied. it's no use you're looking at me, fanny. you will make me talk of it and i won't tell a lie on the subject. i do like lord lofton very much, and i do dislike griselda grandly almost as much."
10076,5463-39173-0035.flac," the point he carries is wretched for three. oh, as for that, i should have thought the new horse might have been able to carry you as far as that, i heard you say you wanted to see mr. crawley. so i do, and the new horse as you call him shall carry me there tomorrow."
10077,5463-39173-0036.flac," will you say that i'll be over about 12 o'clock? you had better say earlier, as he is always out about the parish. very well. say 11. it is paris business about which i am going, so it need not earth as conscience to stay in for me."
10078,5463-39173-0013.flac," the worst of it is that both of them are obliged to wear wigs. shall you have a hat mark with curly things at the side and strings through to hold them up? as lucy, i fear that does not come with my perquests. nor rosette."
10079,5463-39173-0047.flac," to sit still and not be admired would almost suffice for her. i do not worship lady lofton as you do, but i think quite well enough of her to wonder that she should choose such a girl as that for her son's wife. that she does wish that i do not doubt."
10080,5463-39173-0000.flac," chapter 21. why puck the pony was beaten. mark robards returned home that day after the scene at the albany, considerably relieved and spirit."
10081,5463-39173-0025.flac," i know it will be said of lord left unto himself, that, putting aside his purge and broad acres and handsome, son-z-face, he was not worth the girl's care and love."
10082,5463-39173-0033.flac," in all her employments, in her ways about the house, and her accustomed quiet mirth, she was the same as ever. in this, she showed the peculiar strengths which god had given her. but not the less did she entwreuth mourn for her lost love and spoiled ambition."
10083,5463-39173-0023.flac," she had declared to him plainly that she did not love him and could not love him, and had thus thrown away not only riches and honor in high station, but more than that, much worse than that. she had flung away from her lover to whose love her warm heart clung."
10084,5463-39173-0027.flac," lucy robards in her heart did not give her dismissed lover credit for much more heroism than did truly appertain to him. did not perhaps give him full credit for a certain amount of heroism, which did really appertain to him."
10085,5463-39173-0019.flac," but that if the price of dandy could be remitted to him at once, it would greatly facilitate his object. nothing could be more different than mr. sorbys' tone about money at different times. when he wanted to raise the wind, everything was so important."
10086,5463-39173-0052.flac," there was then nothing more said on the subject, and in two minutes they arrived at the house of the hogglestock clergyman. mrs. crawley had brought two children with her when she came from the cornish currency to hogglestock, and two other babies had been added to her care since then."
10087,5463-39173-0053.flac," one of these was now ill with coup, and it was with the object of offering to the mother some comfort and solace that the present visit was made. the two ladies got down from their carriage having obtained the services of a boy to hold puck, and soon found themselves in mrs. crawley's single sitting room."
10088,5463-39173-0007.flac," neither of the two ladies at family parsing knew much about horses, or of the manor in which one gentleman might think it proper to oblige another by purchasing the superfluities of his stable. but they did both feel that there were horses enough in the parsing-in-stable without dandy."
10089,5463-39173-0042.flac," and then she is quiet and reserved. she does not require excitement, and i'm sure it is conscientious in the performance of her duties. very conscientious, i have no doubt said lucy, with something like a sneer in her tone. but the question i suppose is,"
10090,5463-39173-0015.flac," went away when the spring came, leaving their houses innocent and empty. the paris-douty was better attended to, and perhaps domestic duties also. at such period he was a patterned person and a patterned husband."
10091,5463-39173-0024.flac," that her love did cling to him, she knew even then, and owned more thoroughly as soon as he was gone. so much her pride had done for her, and that strong resolve that lady lofton should not scowl on her and tell her that she had entrapped her son."
10092,5463-39173-0021.flac," he could prove with the easiest voice in most jaunty manner that everything was quite serene. now, at this period, he was in that mood of superhuman efforts and he called loudly for the 130 pounds for dandy. after what had passed,"
10093,5463-39173-0032.flac," it was when she was quite alone at night in her own room, or in her solitary walks, that a single silent tear would gather in the corner of her eye and gradually moisten her eyelids. she never told her love, nor did she allow concealment to feed on her damascus cheek."
10094,5463-39173-0006.flac," which he had bought from mr. soarby some little time since, with the object of obliging him. he, mark, intended to sell him again as soon as he could do so judiciously. this, as i have said above, was not satisfactory."
10095,5463-39173-0062.flac, and dr. arbain had promised that no one else should be in the house if mr. crawley objected to society. but this was not what he wanted. the finery and grandeur of the deniery and the comfort of that warm snug library would sound at same at once.
10096,5463-39173-0040.flac," but she did not betray herself. perhaps we may, she said, and then gave the poignia to touch with her whip. oh lucy, i won't have pock beaten. he was going very nicely. i beg pock's pardon."
10097,5463-39173-0017.flac," indeed, just at this moment,"
10098,5463-39173-0009.flac, not more than i shall get against in mark.
10099,5463-39173-0061.flac," but always with the mutual acknowledgments of each other's truth. now they lived comparatively near together, but no opportunities arose for such discussions. at any rate, once a quarter, mr. crawley was pressed by his old friend to visit him at the deniery."
10100,5463-39173-0063.flac," then old days would have come back to them, but now. arabic always rides on a sleek fine horse nowadays. he once said to his wife with a sneer."
10101,5463-39173-0045.flac," then i really do think that he is uncommon bad taste,"" said lucy, with the irality in her voice differing much from the tone of banter she had hitherto used. ""'what, lucy,' said her sister-in-law looking had her."
10102,5463-39173-0005.flac," and lucy's warm and eager joy made him feel quite delighted with mr. sourby in the duke of omnium. and then that splendid animal, dandy, came home to the parsons' stables, much to the delight of the groom and gardener,"
10103,5463-39173-0054.flac," which they knew it would be impossible to introduce in mr. crowley's presence. she, as we have said, was not quite so gaunt, not altogether so haggard as in the latter of those dreadful corner stays. lady lufton and mrs. ariben between them"
10104,5463-39173-0057.flac," as regards the mere eating and drinking, the amounts of butchers made in tea and butter, they of course were used in quantities which any artisan would have regarded as compatible only with demi-starvation. better clothing for her children was necessary and better clothing for him."
10105,5463-39173-0041.flac," but you see, when one is trusted with a whip, one feels such a longing to use it. oh, but you should keep it still. i feel almost certain that lady lofton would like such a match. i dare say she might. miss grantley will have a large fortune, i believe."
10106,5463-39173-0002.flac," on the day after his return, he received proper authentic tidings of his presentation to the prebent. he was, in fact, already prebendry."
10107,5463-39173-0044.flac," oh, by god's mercy, very little. as for me, i shall get over it in three or four years i don't doubt that's if i can get as's milk and change of air. we'll take you to barch esther for that, but as i was saying, i really do think lord left them like scryzel de grandly."
10108,5463-39173-0028.flac," treats herself as a farmer treats his sheep in oxen, makes hardly more of herself of her own inner self, in which are comprised of mind and a soul, than the poor wretch of her own sex, who earns her bread in the lowest stage of degradation."
10109,8123-275193-0025.flac," and a cuticle that showed unmistakable evidence of scurvy. for the first, he was put upon short rations. for the second, sand baths on shore were prescribed."
10110,8123-275193-0016.flac, possibly however rather more intelligent than the average k-9 pet. the 4th of july 1862 was a gala day at roanoke island.
10111,8123-275193-0018.flac," more than to his heart's content, and then patriotically decorated. in his right ear was a red ribbon, in his left, a white one, around his neck, another of blue."
10112,8123-275193-0020.flac," his reward for this unusual demonstration was instantaneous and consisted of some apples and a toothsome dessert of sugar. afterward, he made the round of the camps with a special escort of warrant officers and devoted jack tars."
10113,8123-275193-0019.flac," thus adorned he was brought on shore to pay me a visit. and as he came through my door, he appeared to be filled with the pride of patriotism and a realization of the greatness of the occasion."
10114,8123-275193-0024.flac," it was his habit to go from one forecastle mess to another, and to insist upon having rather more than his share of the choice morsels from each. in a short time he came to the repair shop very much the worse for where, with an impaired digestion,"
10115,8123-275193-0026.flac," under this treatment, poor jeff lost all his buoyancy of spirits and his habitual frisquiness, and became sad and ejected, but bore his troubles with patience. he took to the sand baths at once."
10116,8123-275193-0023.flac," jeff was a confirmed lover of good eating, and in time paid the usual penalty for overindulgence of his very pig-ish appetite. while the meal-penet was up,"
10117,8123-275193-0022.flac, hogs of this particular kind are famous snake killers. a big rattler or a garter snake is all the same to them. they advance to the attack with the greatest impetuosity. and a feast upon snake is the usual reward of exceptional bravery.
10118,8123-275193-0017.flac," was made more glorious by the exchange of camp hospitalities and an indulgence in such simple hilarity as the occasions seemed to require. but jeff was not forgotten. early in the morning, he was bathed and scrubbed,"
10119,8123-275193-0013.flac," was playful, good-natured, and expressed pleasure, pain, anger and desire with various squeals and grunts, delivered with a variety of intonations that were very easily interpreted."
10120,8123-275193-0021.flac," he was seen after he had run a few yards to make a great jump and then remain in his tracks. the pursuing party found him actively engaged in demolishing a moccasin, which he had crushed by jumping and landing with his feet upon its head and back."
10121,8123-275193-0027.flac," and gave forth many disgruntled grunts when lifted out of them. the last time i saw jeff in 1862, he was buried up to his ears in the cool sands of the rhonok island shore, with eyes upturned and looking like a very sad pig."
10122,8123-275193-0015.flac," when on shore, he followed his favorites like a dog, and was never known to root. except in speech and appearance, he was the counterpart of a happy, good-natured, and well-cared for household dog."
10123,8123-275193-0014.flac, he was never so happy as when in the lap of one of the sailors having his back stroked. his pleasure upon those occasions was evinced by the emission of frequent good-natured grunts and looking up into the face of the friendly stroker.
10124,8123-275193-0011.flac, and seemingly was deeply interested in the event. it may be said of him generally that he was overflowing with spirits and took an act of interest in all the daily routine work of his ship.
10125,8123-275193-0001.flac," which composed what commodore goldsboro designated his pasteboard fleet, was the louisiana, commanded by commander alexander murray, who was noted for his efficiency in good nature. his treatment of his crew"
10126,8123-275193-0003.flac," he was a perfectly black pig of the racer-racer back order, which at that time were plentiful in the coast sections of the more southern of the slave-holding states. they were called racers."
10127,8123-275193-0008.flac," he attached himself to each individual of the ship. he had no favorites, but was hail fellow-well-met with all. he developed all the playful qualities of a puppy, and reasoned out a number of problems in his own way."
10128,8123-275193-0009.flac," his particular admirers declared that he learned the meaning of the different whistles of the boat swain, that he knew when the meal-penet was hoisted to the peak. could tell when the crew was beat to quarters for drill."
10129,8123-275193-0006.flac, the doctor was consulted and after a careful diagnosis decided there was no organic disease. want of parental care? want of nourishment and exposure were held responsible for jeff's unfavorable condition?
10130,8123-275193-0012.flac," in the gradual development of jeff's character, it was discovered that he had none of the usual well-known traits of the pig. he was more like a pet-ed and pampered dog."
10131,8123-275193-0010.flac," in this act of courtesy, he has always accompanied by the officer of the deck and often by others that may happen to be at hand. after the advent of jeff, whenever i went on board the louisiana, he was always at the gangway."
10132,8123-275193-0000.flac," jeff the inquisitive by general rush c. hawkins. among the gunboats doing duty on the inland waters of north carolina in the early spring of 1862,"
10133,8123-275193-0004.flac," because of their long legs, slender bodies, and great capacity for running, and razor backs on account of the prominence of the spinal column. the origin of this particular species of the porousine tribe is unknown, but there is a tradition to the effect"
10134,8123-275193-0005.flac," possibly while escaping from the prospective mess kettle of a confederate picket. in those days confederate pickets were not very particular as to the quality or kind of food, and i have a suspicion that even a razor-back would have been a welcome addition to their meal."
10135,8123-275193-0002.flac, made him one of the most popular officers in the whole fleet. he entered into all of their sports and sympathized with the discomforts of forecastle life. he was fond of animal pets and always welcomed the arrival of a new one.
10136,8123-275193-0007.flac," it was decided to put him on a light diet of milk, which proved an immediate success for within 48 hours after his first meal, the patient became as lively as possible. as days and weeks went on,"
10137,8123-275216-0042.flac," by this time there were many more human beings in the land than there were before, and they made haste to hue down the oaks while there were still some remaining. oak timber is better than beach timber, they said."
10138,8123-275216-0041.flac," and the storm broke them off and cast them on the ground. the old oak had now only a few leaves left at the very top. the end is near, he said gravely."
10139,8123-275216-0013.flac," but in this the old oak was wrong, for they did come. towards autumn the bear came back and lay down under the old oak. my friends down there wished me to present their compliments, he said."
10140,8123-275216-0028.flac," how will you be able to hold out when a regular storm comes? i assure you the wind gives one's head a good shaking. my old bows have creaked many a time, and what do you think will become of the flimsy finery that you stick up in the air?"
10141,8123-275216-0019.flac," the sun shone on them, and the rain fell on them, so it was not long before they grew tall. oh, how pretty they are, said the great oak, and stooped his crooked bows still more, so that they could get a good view of them."
10142,8123-275216-0006.flac," it was in a land down towards the south. there i took a nap under the beach trees. they are tall, slim trees, not crooked old things like you. and their tops are so dense that the sunbeams cannot creep through them."
10143,8123-275216-0031.flac," be good enough to move your leaves a little to one side. there have been scarcely any buds on my lowest branches this year. you overshadow me so. i don't quite understand how that concerns us, answered the beaches."
10144,8123-275216-0025.flac," the beaches only laughed and went on growing. at last, they closed together over the little oaks head, and then he died. that was a horrid thing to do."
10145,8123-275216-0040.flac," they are taking our strength out of us, they said, and shook as much as the beaches around would let them. the land is ours no longer. one bow died after another."
10146,8123-275216-0016.flac," the snow lay high over the whole land, and every tree stood deep in his own thoughts, and dreamt of the spring. and when the spring came, the grass stood green, and the birds began singing where they left off last."
10147,8123-275216-0022.flac," and of good family besides. the beaches laughed with their little tiny green leaves, but said nothing. shall i bend my branches a little aside so that the sun can shine better on you? the old tree asked politely."
10148,8123-275216-0045.flac," and not one of my acorns has sprouted under your shade. but before i die, i should like to know the name you give to such conduct. that will not take long to say old friend answered the beaches."
10149,8123-275216-0018.flac," and every morning, when the sun came out, they peeped down to look for the beaches. they were really a little uneasy, but they were too proud to talk about it. and one day, the little shoots did, at last, burst forth from the earth."
10150,8123-275216-0034.flac," and sheltered you against the storm. i let the sun shine on you as much as ever he would, and i treated you as if you were my own children, and in return for all this, you stifled me. staff and nonsense."
10151,8123-275216-0027.flac," you begin to be rather pushing, the old tree said. you should try to grow a little broader and stop this shooting up into the air. just see where your branches are soaring."
10152,8123-275216-0038.flac," all round, new little beach trees shot up, which grew just as fast as their parents, and looked as green and as happy as if they did not know what an uneasy conscience was."
10153,8123-275216-0021.flac," and they said no more. but the little oak could not bear the strange trees. it is dreadful the way you shoot up into the air, he said, in vexation. you are already half as tall as i am. but i beg you to take notice that i am much older."
10154,8123-275216-0017.flac," the kings of the wood do not come till the whole company is assembled. but at last they came. all the leaves burst forth from the swollen buds, and the trees looked at one another and complemented one another on their beauty."
10155,8123-275216-0036.flac," and i'm glad to do you a good turn."" and the fox rolled on the ground at the foot of the beach trees and got his fur full of the prickly fruits and ran with them far out into the country. the bear did the same,"
10156,8123-275216-0008.flac," and perhaps you will be kind enough to leave me at peace, since you cannot give me shade. the bear stretched himself out and closed his eyes, but he got no sleep that time for the other trees had heard his story."
10157,8123-275216-0007.flac, but i don't want to chatter anymore with you just now. i have had to trot a mile on account of a confounded hunter who struck me on one of my hind legs with an arrow. now i should like to have a sleep.
10158,8123-275216-0012.flac," if they come, i will kill them,"" said the little oak tree. but directly afterwards he got one on the head from the old oak. if they come, you shall treat them politely, you young dog,"" said he. but they will not come."
10159,8123-275216-0032.flac," everyone has quite enough to do to look after himself. if he is equal to his work and has luck, it turns out well for him. if not, he must be prepared to go to the wall. that is the way of the world."
10160,8123-275216-0024.flac," and at last quite overtopped the little oak. keep your leaves to yourself, cried the oak. you overshadow me, and that is what i can't endure. i must have plenty of sunshine."
10161,8123-275216-0015.flac," they killed my wife and one of my brothers. and i must see about finding a place where i can live in peace. there is scarcely a spot left where a self-respecting bear can stay. goodbye, you old, narrowed oak trees."
10162,8123-275216-0037.flac," and grend into the bargain at the old oak while he lay and rested in the shadow of the beaches. the field-mouse was beside himself with joy over his new food, and thought that beach-nuts tasted much nicer than acorns."
10163,8123-275216-0023.flac," many thanks answered the beaches. we can grow very nicely in the shade. and the whole summer passed by and another summer after that, and still more summers. the beaches went on growing."
10164,8123-275216-0044.flac," what an old stupid i was. before that we oak trees were lords in the land, and now every year i see my brothers around me, perishing in the fight against you. it will soon be all over with me."
10165,8123-275216-0009.flac," what kind of trees can they be whose leaves sit so close together that the sunbeams cannot creep between them, asked a little oak who was listening to what the big ones were talking about? but by his side stood an old, gnarled tree."
10166,8123-275216-0020.flac," ""'you are welcome among us,' said the old oak, and graciously inclined his head to them. ""'you shall be my foster children, and be treated just as well as my own.'"" ""'thanks,' said the little beaches."
10167,8123-275216-0026.flac," a great oak called out and shook his bows and terror. but the old oak took his foster children under his protection. it serves him right, he said. he is paid out for his boasting."
10168,8123-275216-0011.flac," i will bring some beachnotes with me, and i vow you will all turn yellow with jealousy when you see how pretty the new trees are. then he made off. but the oaks talked the whole day long, one to another, about the funny trees he had told them about."
10169,8123-275216-0043.flac," at last, we get a little appreciation,"" said the old oak, but we have to pay for it, with our lives. then he said to the beach trees. what was i thinking of when i helped you on in your young days?"
10170,8123-275216-0014.flac," and he picked some funny things out of his shaggy coat. here, you may see what i have for you. what is it, ask the oak? that is beach, answer the bear. the beach nuts which i promised you."
10171,8123-275216-0010.flac," who gave the little oka a clout on the head with one of his lowest bows. hold your tongue, he said, and don't talk till you have something to talk about. you need none of you believe a word of the bears nonsense."
10172,8123-275216-0030.flac," that is not a polite way of speaking to an old tree with moth on his bows,"" said the oak. i begin to repent that i was so kind to you. if you have a spark of honorable feeling alive in you,"
10173,8123-275216-0033.flac," then the oaks lowest branch died, and he began to be seriously alarmed. ""'you are pretty things,' he said. ""'if this is the way you reward me for my hospitality, when you were little i let you grow at my feet.'"
10174,8123-275216-0035.flac," said the beaches. so they put forth flowers and fruit, and when the fruit was ripe, the wind shook the bows and scattered it round far and wide. you are quick people like me said the wind. i like you for it."
10175,8123-275216-0039.flac," but the old oak gazed sadly out over the wood. the light green beach leaves were peeping out everywhere, and the oaks were sighing and be wailing their distress to one another."
10176,8123-275216-0029.flac, everyone has his own manner of growth and we have ours answered the young beaches. this is the way it's done where we come from and we are perhaps as good as you are.
10177,8123-275216-0001.flac," we are all oak trees, they said. we owned land and rule over it. and they were right. there were only a few human beings there in those days, and those that there were were nothing better than wild animals."
10178,8123-275216-0000.flac," trees. but trees there were in plenty. they stood everywhere from coast to coast. they saw themselves reflected in all the rivers and lakes, and stretched their mighty bows up towards heaven."
10179,8123-275216-0002.flac," the bear, the wolf, and the fox went out hunting while the stag grazed by the edge of the fin. the field mouse sat outside his hole and ate acorns, and the beaver built his artistic houses by the river banks."
10180,8123-275216-0005.flac," i am lord in the land, and whatever way you look, you find my brothers and nothing else. true, muddled the bear, that is just what is so sickening. i have been for a little tour abroad, i may tell you, and i'm just a little bit spoiled."
10181,8123-275216-0004.flac," said the bear, licking his paws. that is all the shade you can give against the sun."" ""'if you are not pleased with me, you can go,' answered the oak proudly."""
10182,8123-275216-0003.flac," one day the bear came trudging along and lay down at full breadth under a great oak tree. are you there again, you robber, said the oak, and shook a lot of withered leaves down over him. you should not squander your leaves, my old friend."
10183,8123-275209-0022.flac," i would tell you if you would believe me, saying the lark descending once more. i believe everything i am told, reiterated the caterpillar, with as grave a face as if it were a fact."
10184,8123-275209-0005.flac," was left standing alone by the side of the butterflies' eggs. a pretty nurse she has chosen indeed, poor lady, exclaimed she. and a pretty business i have in hand? why, her senses must have left her."
10185,8123-275209-0017.flac," two, and the honey out of flowers i am afraid, side the caterpillar. no such thing old lady, something simpler than that. something that you can get at quite easily."
10186,8123-275209-0013.flac," perhaps you will be able to inquire, and hear something about it next time you go up high. observe the caterpillar timidly. the lark said perhaps he should, but he did not satisfy her curiosity any further."
10187,8123-275209-0011.flac," he must be very clever and know a great deal for to go up very high, which she could never do, was the caterpillar's idea of perfect glory. now in the neighboring cornfield, there lived a lark."
10188,8123-275209-0025.flac," i will ask your advice no more."" i told you you would not believe me. cry the lark, nettle in his turn. ""'i believe everything that i am told,' persisted the caterpillar. that is—'"
10189,8123-275209-0014.flac," soon afterwards, however, he went singing upwards into the bright blue sky. by degrees, his voice died away in the distance till the green caterpillar could not hear a sound."
10190,8123-275209-0016.flac, i believe everything i am told observed the caterpillar hastily. well then first of all i will tell you what these little creatures are to eat. what do you think it is to be? guess.
10191,8123-275209-0030.flac," and had already made a show of a hole in the cabbage leaf. they had broken from the butterflies' eggs. shame and amazement filled our green friend's heart, but joy soon followed."
10192,8123-275209-0033.flac," and when she was going into her chrysalis grave, she said, i shall be about her fly someday."" but her relations thought her head was wandering, and they said, poor thing."
10193,8123-275209-0010.flac," side the caterpillar in great distress, and then she thought and thought, till at last she thought of the lark, and she fancied that because he went up so high and nobody knew where he went to."
10194,8123-275209-0034.flac," and when she was about her fly and was going to die again, she said,"
10195,8123-275209-0024.flac, you jest with my inferiority. now you are cruel as well as foolish.
10196,8123-275209-0023.flac," then i'll tell you something else, cried the lark. for the best of my news remains behind. you will one day be a butterfly yourself."" richard bird exclaimed the caterpillar."
10197,8123-275209-0004.flac," and with these words, the butterfly drooped her wings and died. and the green caterpillar, who had not had the opportunity of even saying yes or no to the request,"
10198,8123-275209-0032.flac, and the caterpillar talked all the rest of her life to her relations of the time when she should be a butterfly. but none of them believed her. she nevertheless had learnt the larks less than of faith.
10199,8123-275209-0021.flac, but i find that he is foolish and saucy instead.
10200,8123-275209-0020.flac," and yet that is but a beginning of what i have to tell you. why caterpillar? what do you think those little eggs will turn out to be? ""'butterflies to be sure,' said the caterpillar. ""'catterpillars,' sang the lark."
10201,8123-275209-0007.flac," however, there lay the eggs on the cabbage leaf, and the green caterpillar had a kind heart, so she resolved to do her best. but she got no sleep that night. she was so very anxious."
10202,8123-275209-0019.flac," but why do you ask me and then disbelieve what i say? you have neither faith nor trust. oh, i believe everything i am told,"" said the caterpillar. nay, but you do not, replied the lark. you won't believe me even about the food."
10203,8123-275209-0027.flac," as well as you do. look at my long green body in these endless legs, and then talk to me about having wings and a painted feathery coat, full. and full you, cried the indignant"
10204,8123-275209-0029.flac," interrupted the lark. how am i to learn faith?"" asked the caterpillar. at that moment, she felt something at her side. she looked round. eight or ten little green caterpillars were moving about."
10205,8123-275209-0009.flac," whom should the caterpillar consult? there was the shaggy dog, who sometimes came into the garden, but he was so rough. he would most likely whisk all the eggs off the cabbage leaf with one brush of his tail."
10206,8123-275209-0018.flac," never,"" said the caterpillar indignantly. it was their dying mother's last request that i should do no such thing. their dying mother knew nothing about the matter, persisted the lark."
10207,8123-275209-0012.flac," and the caterpillar sent a message to him, to beg him to come and talk to her. and when he came, she told him all her difficulties and asked him what she was to do, to feed and rear the little creatures so different from herself."
10208,8123-275209-0028.flac," oh, caterpillar, what comes to you from thence? receive as i do!"
10209,8123-275209-0031.flac," for as the first wonder was possible, the second might be so too. ""'teach me your lesson, lark,' she would say, and the lark saying to her of the wonders of the earth below and of the heaven above."""
10210,8123-275209-0008.flac," she made her back quite ache with walking all night round her young charges, for fear any harm should happen to them. and in the morning says she to herself, two heads are better than one."
10211,8123-275209-0026.flac," i see so many wonderful things. i know no reason why there should not be more. oh, cat or pillar, it is because you crawl, because you never get beyond your cabbage leaf, that you call anything impossible."
10212,8123-275209-0015.flac," so she resumed her walk around the butterfly's eggs, nibbling a bit of the cabbage leaf now and then as she moved along."
10213,8123-275209-0006.flac, or she never would have asked a poor crawling creature like me to bring up her dainty little ones? much they'll mind me truly when they feel the gay wings on their backs and can fly away out of my sight whenever they choose.
10214,8123-275209-0002.flac," you must give them early dew and honey from the flowers. and you must let them fly about only a little way at first, for of course one can't expect them to use their wings properly all at once."
10215,8123-275209-0001.flac," who will take care of my baby butterflies when i am gone? will you, kind, mild, green caterpillar? but you must mind what you give them to eat caterpillar. they cannot, of course, live on your rough food."
10216,8123-275209-0003.flac," dear me, it is a sad pity you cannot fly yourself. but i have no time to look for another nurse now. so you will do your best, i hope. dear, dear."
10217,8123-275209-0000.flac, the butterfly's children by mrs. alfred gatti. let me hire you as a nurse for my poor children. set a butterfly to a quiet caterpillar who was strolling along a cabbage leaf in her.
10218,7794-295955-0018.flac," it was disgusting, and it seized him by the waste and wrestled with him a summer's day till afternoon. but when the afternoon heat came on, the dragon said, let me go, prince, that i may moisten my parched head in the lake, and may toss you to the sky."
10219,7794-295955-0001.flac," but it was not a hair, but a dragon, which waited for and devoured him. when some days had elapsed and the princess did not return, either of them, the whole court was in sorrow."
10220,7794-295955-0027.flac," hold it, don't let it go. and the dog sprang up and after it caught it and soon tore it to pieces. but out of the bore flew a pigeon, and the prince loosed the falcon and the falcon caught the pigeon."
10221,7794-295955-0017.flac," come out to single combat with me, that we may measure ourselves once more together, unless you are a woman. the dragon replied, i will do so, prince now. now. year long behold the dragon. it was large, it was terrible."
10222,7794-295955-0009.flac," took a shepherd's staff in his hand and went into the world. as he went on thus from village to village and from town to town, at last he came into another empire and into the imperial city, in a lake under which the dragon was."
10223,7794-295955-0012.flac," don't let the sheep have their own way and go where they will, but keep them where you will. feprin's thanked the emperor, got himself ready and called out the sheep, taking with him more over, two hounds that could catch a bore in the open country."
10224,7794-295955-0008.flac," my strength is a long way off, and you cannot go thither. far in another empire, under the emperor's city is a lake, and in that lake is a dragon, and in that dragon a bore, and in the bore a pigeon, and in that is my strength."""
10225,7794-295955-0015.flac," because he had come, whereas previously, no shepherd had been able to come from the lake. the next day the prince got ready again and went with his sheep straight to the lake. but the emperor sent two grooms after him to go stealthily and see what he did."
10226,7794-295955-0026.flac," then he swung the dragon and tossed it high into the air, and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces. but as it burst into pieces, out of it sprang a wild boar and started to run away. but the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs."
10227,7794-295955-0006.flac," the old woman interrupted him. how should i not? it captured me too, in this way. but now i have no means of escape. then he proceeded. listen well to what i am going to say to you. ask it whether it goes and where its strength is."
10228,7794-295955-0016.flac," and they placed themselves on a high hill once they could have a good view. when the shepherd arrived, he put the hounds and bagpipes under the stump and a falcon upon it. then tucked up his hose and sleeves, wedded into the lake and shouted, dragon, dragon,"
10229,7794-295955-0010.flac," on going into the town he began to inquire who wanted a shepherd. the citizens told him that the emperor did. then he went straight to the emperor. after he announced himself, the emperor admitted him into his presence and asked him."
10230,7794-295955-0022.flac," so many people. when on the morrow the day dawned and the sun came forth, uproast the shepherd, uproast the maiden too, to begin to prepare for going to the lake. the shepherd was cheerful, more cheerful than ever."
10231,7794-295955-0030.flac," he washed himself nicely, took the falcon on his shoulder, the hounds behind him, and the bagpipes under his arm. played as he went, drove the sheep,"
10232,7794-295955-0019.flac," when the night approached, the prince drove the sheep as before and went home playing the bagpipes. when he arrived at the town, the whole town was a stir and began to wonder, because the shepherd came home every evening, which no one had been able to do before."
10233,7794-295955-0024.flac," when they arrived at the lake, the sheep immediately spread round it. and the prince placed a falcon on the stump, and the hounds and bagpipes under it. then tucked up his hose and sleeves, waded into the water and shouted, dragon, dragon!"
10234,7794-295955-0028.flac," cut these three ones up from below and strike with them upon their root. an iron door will immediately open into a large vault. in that vault are many people. old and young, rich and poor, small and great, wives and maidens,"
10235,7794-295955-0025.flac," the prince replied, come, dragon, don't talk nonsense. if i had emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead, i would toss you much higher. when he said this, the emperor's daughter ran up and kissed him on the face, on the eye, and on the forehead."
10236,7794-295955-0000.flac," then the middle sun went hunting, and as he issued from the town, a hare sprang out of a bush, and the prince after it, and hither and thither, till the hare fled into the watermill and the prince after it."
10237,7794-295955-0020.flac," those two grooms had already arrived at the palace before the prince and related to the emperor in order, everything that they had heard and seen. now when the emperor saw that the shepherd returned home, he immediately summoned his daughter into his presence and told her all."
10238,7794-295955-0029.flac," so that you could settle a populist empire there to wear your brothers. when the pigeon had told them all this, the prince immediately rang its neck. the emperor had gone out in person."
10239,7794-295955-0007.flac," when the dragon came in, the old woman began to question it. wearing god's name have you been. with or do you go so far, you will never tell me with or you go. the dragon replied, well, my dear old woman, i do go far."
10240,7794-295955-0014.flac," let me go, prince, that i may moisten my parched head in the lake and toss you to the sky. but the prince replied, come, dragon, don't talk nonsense. if i had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead, i would toss you still higher."
10241,7794-295955-0013.flac," and the hounds and bagpipes under the stump. then, tucked up his hose and sleeves, waded into the lake and began to shout. dragon, dragon, come out to single combat with me today."
10242,7794-295955-0004.flac," she replied, my son, that was not a hare, but a dragon. it kills and frautles many people. hearing this, the prince was somewhat disturbed, and said to the old woman, what shall we do now? doubtless my two brothers also have perished here."
10243,7794-295955-0021.flac," and i am your only daughter, and you don't care about me if i perish. then the emperor began to persuade and encourage her. don't fear my daughter. you see, we have had so many changes of shepherds, and of all that went out to the lake, not one has returned."
10244,7794-295955-0023.flac," but the emperor's daughter was sad and shed tears. the shepherd comforted her. lady sister, i pray you, do not weep, but do what i tell you, when it is time, run up and kiss me and fear not. as he went and drove the sheep."
10245,7794-295955-0031.flac," when they came to the town, all the town assembled as to see a wonder. the emperor, who had seen all his heroism from the hill, called him into his presence and gave him his daughter, went immediately to church, had them married, and held a wedding festival for a week."
10246,7794-295955-0003.flac," but the prince did not choose to follow it, but went to find other game, saying to himself, when i return i shall find you. after thus, he went for a long time up and down the hill but found nothing, and then returned to the water mill."
10247,7794-295955-0011.flac," and when you call the sheep out, they go thither at once and spread themselves round the lake. but whatever shepherd goes off there, that shepherd returns back no more. therefore my son, i tell you."
10248,7794-295955-0005.flac," the old woman answered. they have indeed, but there is no help for it. go hope my son. let's you follow them."" then he said to her, ""'dear old woman, do you know what? i know that you will be glad to liberate yourself from that pest.'"
10249,7794-295955-0002.flac," then the third son went hunting to see whether he could not find his brothers. when he issued from the town, again, upsprang a hair out of a bush and a prince after it, and hither and thither, till the hair fled into the water mill."
10250,7794-295947-0041.flac," are locally worshiped. touching the remedy of the fox's liver prescribed in the tale, i may add that there would be nothing strange in this to a person acquainted with the chinese pharmacopoeia, which the japanese long exclusively followed."
10251,7794-295947-0040.flac," in china, on the contrary, in spite of what has been written by meadows and other admirers of the examination system, a man can be what he pleases by paying for it."
10252,7794-295947-0043.flac," and on another occasion, a groom of mine suffering from dysentery was treated with acupuncture of the tongue. the art of medicine would appear to be at the present time in china, much in the state in which it existed in europe in the 16th century."
10253,7794-295947-0046.flac," and often prescribed with due academic solemnity. and the bones of the human skull, pulverized and administered with oil, were used as a specific in cases of renal calculus. see petri andrei mathioli, opera, 1574."
10254,7794-295947-0044.flac," for attention caused by either renal or vesical calculi. but i have myself thoroughly experienced the utility of an oil i make myself, where of scorpions form a very large portion of the ingredients."
10255,7794-295947-0045.flac," if only the region of the heart and all the pulses of the body be anointed with it, it will free the patients from the effects of all kinds of poisons taken by the mouth, corrosive ones accepted. decoctions of egyptian mummies were much commended."
10256,7794-295947-0042.flac," although they are now successfully studying the art of healing as practiced in the west, when i was at picking i saw a chinese physician prescribe a decoction of three scorpions for a child struck down with fever."
10257,7794-295947-0016.flac," last night, the foxes' liver that you required fell into his hands, so he sent me to bring it to you. with these words, the messenger produced a small jar, adding, in a few days he will let you know the price."
10258,7794-295947-0033.flac," and spent the night in reciting prayers and praises, and the next day they published the matter to the household and to their relations and friends. now, although there are instances of men killing their own children to require a favor,"
10259,7794-295947-0005.flac," and gave half a boo to the three boys who ran away delighted. the man's friend upon this said to him, well certainly you have got queer tastes. what on earth are you going to keep the fox for?"""
10260,7794-295947-0012.flac," now, the man who had rescued the foxes' cup was a tradesman in good circumstances. he had three or four agents and two maid servants besides men's servants. and altogether, he lived in a liberal manner. he was married and this union had brought him one son."
10261,7794-295947-0024.flac," wish you had just procured and said that he would come and tell us the price another day. when we asked him to spend the night here, he answered that he would lodge with a relation in the next village and went away. the visitor was more and more lost in amazement and,"
10262,7794-295947-0017.flac," when he had delivered his message, the master of the house was greatly pleased and said, indeed i am deeply grateful for this kindness which will save my son's life. then the good wife came out and received the jar with every mark of politeness."
10263,7794-295947-0011.flac," so, with peace in their hearts, the latter went off to another place and, choosing a pretty spot, produced the wine bottle and ate their noonday meal. and after a pleasant day, they returned to their homes and became firmer friends than ever."
10264,7794-295947-0025.flac," last spring when i was taking out my cub to play, it was carried off by some boys and only saved by your goodness. the desire to require this kindness pierced me to the quick. at last, when calamity attacked your house,"
10265,7794-295947-0036.flac, all matters connected with the shrines of the shinto or indigenous religion are confined to the superintendents of the families of yoshida and fushimi.
10266,7794-295947-0009.flac," so they stroked it gently on the back and petted it, and as the pain of the wound seemed to have subsided, they were admiring the properties of the herb. when opposite to them, they saw the old foxes sitting watching them by the side of some stacks of rice straw."
10267,7794-295947-0000.flac," on the same errands as themselves. as soon as the children saw the foxes, they picked up a bamboo stick and took the creature stealthily in the rear. and when the old foxes took to flight, they surrounded them and beat them with a stick."
10268,7794-295947-0008.flac," the other, retiring backward and bowing with his hands on his knees replied. indeed, indeed, i am filled with admiration at the goodness of your heart. when i hear you speak thus, i feel more than ever how great is the love i bear you."
10269,7794-295947-0004.flac," and got us to come out to the hills and catch one, and so we can't sell him to you at any price. well, i suppose it cannot be helped then, but how much will the young man give you for the cub? oh, he'll give us 300 cash at least."
10270,7794-295947-0037.flac," the affairs of the buddhists or imported religion are under the care of the family of kansuji, as it is necessary that those who as priests perform the honorable office of serving the gods should be persons of some standing."
10271,7794-295947-0007.flac," but today you have accused me of being eccentric, and i see how mistaken i have been in you. however, our friendship shall cease from this day forth. and when he had said this with a great deal of firmness,"
10272,7794-295947-0014.flac," we don't care what price we might have to pay for a fox's liver, pray by one for us at any expense. so they pressed him to exert himself on their behalf, and he, having promised faithfully to execute the commission, went his way."
10273,7794-295947-0026.flac," i thought i might be of use to you. your son's illness could not be cured without a liver taken from a live fox. so to repay your kindness, i killed my cub and took out his liver. then it sire disguising himself as a messenger."
10274,7794-295947-0038.flac," a certain small rank is procured for them through the intervention of the representatives of the above noble families, who, on the issuing of the required patent, receive as their prerequisite a fee, which, although insignificant in itself,"
10275,7794-295947-0010.flac," look there, the old foxes have come back, out of fear for their cub's safety. come, we will set it free. and with these words, they untied the string around the cub's neck and turned its head toward the spot where the old foxes sat."
10276,7794-295947-0027.flac," brought it to your house. and as she spoke, the fox shed tears. and the master of the house, wishing to thank her, moved in bed upon which his wife awoke and asked him what was the matter, but he too, to her great astonishment,"
10277,7794-295947-0032.flac," when she heard this, the good wife likewise was blinded by her tears, and for a while they lay lost in thought. but at last, coming to themselves, they lighted the lamp on the shelf on which the family idols stood."
10278,7794-295947-0028.flac," was biting the pillow and weeping bitterly. why are you weeping thus?"" asked she. at last he sat up in bed and said, last spring when i was out on a pleasure excursion, i was the means of saving the life of a fox's cub."
10279,7794-295947-0006.flac," how could i stand by and see life taken? it was but a little i spent, only half a boo, to save the cub. but had it cost a fortune i should not have grudged it. i thought you were intimate enough with me to know my heart."
10280,7794-295947-0030.flac," to buy it for me. how the foxes came to hear of this i don't know, but the foxes to whom i had shown kindness killed their own cub and took out the liver. and the old dog fox disguising himself as a messenger from the person to whom"
10281,7794-295947-0003.flac," well, reply the other, after considering the matter attentively. i suppose it's all the same to you whom you sell him to. you'd better let me have him. oh, but the young man from our village promised us a good sum if we could find a fox."
10282,7794-295947-0019.flac," and i will pass the night with him, and so he took his leave and went away. the parents lost no time in sending to let the physician know that they had procured the fox's liver. the next day the doctor came and compounded a medicine for the patient."
10283,7794-295947-0039.flac," whose panellist condition forms a great contrast to the wealth of their infariors in rank, the dimeos. i believe that this is the only case in which rank can be bought or sold in japan."
10284,7794-295947-0034.flac," there is no other example of foxes having done such a thing, so the story became the talk of the whole country. now, the boy who had recovered through the efficacy of this medicine selected the prettiest spot on the premises."
10285,7794-295947-0015.flac," in the night of the following day, there came a messenger who announced himself as coming from the person who had undertaken to procure the fox's liver, so the master of the house went out to see him. i have come from mr. so and so."

10287,7794-295947-0029.flac," as i told you at the time. the other day i told mr. so-and-so that, although my son were to die before my eyes, i would not be the means of killing a fox on purpose, but asked him, in case he heard of any hunter killing a fox,"
10288,7794-295947-0023.flac," pray and choir carefully into the matter. well, this is very strange. four nights ago, a man of some five or six and thirty years of age came with a verbal message from you, to the effect that you had sent him with a fox's liver."
10289,7794-295947-0021.flac," how quickly you fulfilled our wishes and how kind of you to send at once the doctor prepared the medicine and now our boy can get up and walk about the room and it's all owing to your goodness. wait a bit, cried the guest."
10290,7794-295947-0018.flac," we must make a present to the messenger. indeed, sir, i've already been paid for my trouble. well, at any rate, you must stop the night here. thank you, sir. i have a relation in the next village whom i have not seen for a long while."
10291,7794-295947-0035.flac," the saints who are worshipped in japan writes a native authority. are men who, in their remote ages, when the country was developing itself, were sages, and by their great and virtuous deeds, having earned the gratitude of future generations?"
10292,7794-295947-0022.flac," who did not know what to make of the joy of the two parents. the commission with which you entrusted me about the fox's liver turned out to be a matter of impossibility. so i came today to make my excuses, and now i really can't understand what you are so grateful to me for."
10293,7794-295947-0020.flac," which at once produced a good effect, and there was no little joy in the household. as luck would have it, three days after this, the man whom they had commissioned to buy the foxes' liver came to the house, so the good wife hurried out to meet him and welcome him."
10294,7794-295947-0013.flac," even though our child should die for it, they said, we will not ourselves deprive other creatures of their lives. but you, who live among the hills, are sure to hear when your neighbors go out fox hunting."
10295,7794-295947-0031.flac," we had confided the commission, came here with it. his mate has just been at my pillowside, and told me all about it. hence it was that, in spite of myself, i was moved to tears."
10296,7794-295947-0002.flac," hello, you boys. what are you doing with that fox? the eldest of the boys replied, we're going to take him home and sell him to a young man in our village. he'll buy him, and then he'll boil him in a pot and eat him."
10297,7794-295948-0009.flac," being such as i am, i have no desire and no wishes. glad as i am to hear your kind intentions. there is nothing that i can ask you to do for me. you need feel no anxiety on my account, as long as i live when the winter comes."
10298,7794-295948-0022.flac," fused it afresh in the fire, and at this work i spent months and days. as the badger finished speaking, the priest looked at the money which it had produced, and sure enough he saw that it was bright and new and clean."
10299,7794-295948-0010.flac," you shall be welcome here. the badger on hearing this could not conceal its admiration of the depth of the old man's benevolence, but having so much to be grateful for, it felt hurt at not being able to requite it."
10300,7794-295948-0000.flac, night and morning he recited the prayer.
10301,7794-295948-0005.flac," went into the hut and squatting down by the fire began to warm itself, and the priest with renewed fervor recited his prayers and struck his bell before the image of buddha, looking straight before him."
10302,7794-295948-0025.flac," it came and spent the winter nights with him. from this story, it is plain that even beasts have a sense of gratitude. in this quality, dogs excel all other beasts."
10303,7794-295948-0018.flac," the priest thought this very strange, but imagined either that the badger stayed away because it did not like to come without the money, or that it had been killed in an attempt to steal it, and he blamed himself for having added to his sins for no purpose."
10304,7794-295948-0011.flac," as this subject was often renewed between them, the priests at last touched by the goodness of the badger's heart said, since i have shave in my head, renounced the world, and forsaken the pleasures of this life, i have no desire to gratify."
10305,7794-295948-0026.flac, written in the annals of japan.
10306,7794-295948-0024.flac," but i shall say that the badger that gave me the money has ceased coming to my hut, you need not fear being way laid, but can come as of old and shelter yourself from the cold. to this the badger nodded ascent, and as long as the old priest lived,"
10307,7794-295948-0007.flac," the priest at last became very friendly with it, and got used to its company. so that if ever, as the night wore on, the banjor did not arrive, he used to miss it, and wonder why it did not come."
10308,7794-295948-0004.flac," but now i am growing old, and this severe cold is more than i can bear. i pray you, to let me enter and warm myself at the fire of your cottage, that i may live through this bitter night."
10309,7794-295948-0015.flac," i have told you what is on my mind."" when the priest had done speaking, the badger lent its head on one side with a puzzled and anxious look, so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a wish which seemed to give the beast trouble."
10310,7794-295948-0012.flac," yet i own, i should like to possess three reos in gold. food and remand i receive by the favor of the villagers, so i take no heed for those things, where i to die tomorrow and attain my wish of being born again into the next world."
10311,7794-295948-0002.flac," and when his roof or his walls fell out of repair, they would mend them for him, so for the things of this world he took no thought. one very cold night, when he little thought anyone was outside, he heard a voice calling."
10312,7794-295948-0023.flac," as he was thanking the badger with great politeness and ceremony the beast said, in doing this i have but fulfilled my own wish, still i hope that you will tell this thing to no man. indeed replied the priest."
10313,7794-295948-0014.flac," whereby i might enter into salvation. yet i would not get this money by violent or unlawful means. i only think of what might be if i had it, so you see, since you have expressed such kind feelings toward me,"
10314,7794-295948-0008.flac," and even after my death, i must remember them. what can i do to requite them, if there is anything that you wish for, pray, tell me? the priest, smiling at this speech answered,"
10315,7794-295948-0021.flac," if the money which you required had been for unlawful purposes, i could easily have procured as much as ever you might have wanted. but when i heard that it was to be offered to a temple for masses for your soul, i"
10316,7794-295948-0003.flac," your reverence, your reverence, so he rose and went out to see who it was. and there he beheld an old badger standing. any ordinary man would have been greatly alarmed at the apparition."
10317,7794-295948-0001.flac," although the fame of his virtue did not reach far, yet his neighbors respected and revered him."
10318,7794-295948-0019.flac," repenting when it was too late. persuaded, however, that the badger must have been killed. he passed his time in putting up prayers upon prayers for it. after three years had gone by, one night"
10319,7794-295948-0013.flac," the same kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body. thus, although i have no other reason to wish for money, still if i had three reo's, i would offer them up at some holy shrine that masses and prayers might be said for me."
10320,7794-295948-0020.flac," the old man heard the voice near his door calling out, your reverence, your reverence. as the voice was like that of the badger, he jumped up as soon as he heard it, and ran to open the door, and there, sure enough, was the badger."
10321,7794-295948-0006.flac," after two hours, the badger took its leave, with profuse expressions of thanks and went out, and from that time forth it came every night to the hut. as the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches and dead leaves from the hills for firewood."
10322,7794-295948-0017.flac," and the badger, feigning a scent to what the priest had impressed upon it, returned to the hills as usual. from that time forth, the badger came no more to the hut."
10323,7794-295948-0016.flac," and tried to retract what he had said. post-humus honors, after all, are the wish of ordinary men. i, who am a priest, ought not to entertain such thoughts, or to want money, so pray, pay no attention to what i have said."""
10324,2007-149877-0018.flac," and a watch chain of solid gold, which held a charm of rich design, and watch of the latest make and engraving. he knew by name and could greet personally with a well-old fellow."

10330,2007-149877-0045.flac," in the last analysis, that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations, but rather of the innate trend of the mind. the such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed"
10331,2007-149877-0025.flac, and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great american upper class. the first grade below the luxurious rich.

10335,2007-149877-0047.flac," and there would not be one to gain, say, the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain. the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion. yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber."
10336,2007-149877-0007.flac," particularly among those who had not yet reached, but hoped to do so, the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented. you don't say so would be the reply."

10339,2007-149877-0040.flac," it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans, that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything safe formalities where the sharp ear'd may hear, and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst."
10340,2007-149877-0000.flac," on this particular evening, he dined at rectors, a restaurant of some local fame, which occupied a basement of clark and monroe streets. thereafter, he visited the resort of fitzgerald and moise in adam street opposite the imposing federal building."
10341,2007-149877-0041.flac," nevertheless, the fact that your men gather, hear chatter, hear love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds. it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires"
10342,2007-149877-0038.flac," to one not inclined to drink and gifted with a more serious turn of mind, such a bubbling, chattering, glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly, a strange commentary on nature and life."
10343,2007-149877-0035.flac," as was considered proper, and herstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with celser. what's become of cario? remarked herstwood. i haven't seen him around here in two weeks."
10344,2007-149877-0002.flac," druë was not a drinker in excess. he was not a moneyed man. he only craved the best as his mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to him a part of the best."

10357,2007-149877-0004.flac," he loved fine clothes, good eating, and particularly the company and acquaintance ship of successful men. when dining, it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that joseph jefferson was want to come to this same place."
10358,2007-149877-0037.flac," no, he can't injure that, any, i guess. hirstwood was standing, his coat opened, his thumbs in his pocket, the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness. he was the picture of fistidius comfort."
10359,2007-149877-0056.flac," said joy, mentioning the popular farce at the time. well, you'd better be going. it's half after eight already. and he drew out his watch. the crowd was already thinning out considerably."
10360,2007-149877-0026.flac," the latter's genial nature and dressy appearance pleased him. he knew that joy was only a traveling salesman and not one of many years at that, but the firm of barclad kerrio and company"
10361,2007-149877-0046.flac," could scarcely be laid at the door of anything to save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected. remove the element, so thoroughly and solely complained of. lickr."

10364,2007-149877-0012.flac," he had been pointed out as a very successful and well-known man about town. hurst would look to the part, for besides being slightly under 40, he had a good, stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid, substantial air."
10365,2007-149877-0023.flac, these were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously.

10368,2007-149877-0049.flac," under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing. under the stars and sweeping night winds, what a lamp flower it must bloom."
10369,2007-149877-0059.flac," i struck a little peach coming in on the train friday, remarked roy by way of parting. by george that's so. i must go and call on her before i go away."" oh, never mind her, her sword remarked."
10370,2007-149877-0048.flac," the dressy, greedy company, the small, self-interested paliver, the disorganized, aimless, wandering mental action which it represents. the love of light and show and finery which, to one outside,"

10375,2007-149877-0044.flac," no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber. the worst effect of such a thing would be, perhaps, to stir up in the material-minded and ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis."
10376,2007-149877-0013.flac," which was composed in part of his fine clothes, his clean linen, his jewels, and above all, his own sense of his importance. druy immediately conceived a notion of him as being someone worth knowing,"
10377,2007-149877-0016.flac, the chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the owners.
10378,2007-149877-0039.flac," here come the moths, an endless procession to bask in the light of the flame. such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds."
10379,2007-149877-0019.flac," hundreds of actors, merchants, politicians, and the general run of successful characters about town, and it was part of his success to do so. he had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship, which improved from the how do you do?"
10380,2007-149877-0008.flac," why he's manager of the grand opera house. when these things would fall upon druais' ears, he would straighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort. if he had any vanity, this augmented it."
10381,2007-149877-0032.flac," friday, said droy, had a fine trip. «glad of it,' said herstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which have displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. what are you going to take? he added as the barkeeper in snowy jacket and tie."
10382,2007-149877-0031.flac," how goes it? the room was crowded. dru'ae shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the bar. oh, all right. i haven't seen you in six weeks. when did you get in?"
10383,2007-149877-0022.flac," without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions. there were in the last place a few good followers, neither rich nor poor, famous nor yet remarkably successful, with whom he was friendly on the score of good fellowship."
10384,2007-149877-0020.flac," who, by long-frequeting of the place, became aware of his position to the why old man, how are you? which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly. there was a class, however,"
10385,2007-149877-0001.flac," there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars, one of which he lighted. this to him represented in part, high life, a fair sample of what the whole must be."
10386,2007-132570-0051.flac," yet something like a shade of fear passed over his countenance. emily sat down in a chair near the door, for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her. but montoni paused scarcely an instant in commanding his features,"
10387,2007-132570-0011.flac," come forth, my valorous, senior steward."" just then old carlo opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand, for as soon as the senior saw him."
10388,2007-132570-0052.flac," resumed his discourse in a lower yet sterner voice. i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character, which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me."
10389,2007-132570-0013.flac," interrupted emily, quite weird by this story. do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice?"
10390,2007-132570-0028.flac, and he could be here in no other character. how could he obtain the means of walking broad on the rampart?
10391,2007-132570-0032.flac," but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady's death, too."
10392,2007-132570-0054.flac," for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition, it would not now appease my indignation. i will have vengeance as well as justice."" another grown field of pause which montoni made."
10393,2007-132570-0008.flac," yes, he did indeed, mum-zell, notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary."

10397,2007-132570-0049.flac," yet this, it appears, has not been sufficient to deter you."
10398,2007-132570-0045.flac," replied emily, that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right. montoni turned pale with anger, while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech."
10399,2007-132570-0015.flac," now, i dare say you are thinking of montsuerval in court, and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state, and that he has met with some of our people and is taking captive."
10400,2007-132570-0047.flac," you have dared to question my right, now dare to question my power. i have a punishment which you think not of. it is terrible. this night, this very night. this."
10401,2007-132570-0036.flac," because said he we don't go shares there. this information heightened emily's impatience to no more, and in that immediately departed on her inquiry. the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations."
10402,2007-132570-0021.flac," all the world could not persuade me out of them. roberto and sebastian in half a dozen more of them went into fits. to be sure there was no occasion for that, i said myself. there was no need of that."
10403,2007-132570-0027.flac," opposite to her encasement. she was for a moment inclined to believe it was valencourt whom she had seen. yet, if it was, he why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so? and if he was a prisoner in the castle,"
10404,2007-132570-0019.flac," and then it was gone, and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls, so they helped one another up again as fast as they could. you would not believe, mumzel, though i showed you the very cannon where it used to appear."
10405,2007-132570-0007.flac," well, well, said emily impatiently and anxious to inquire on another subject."
10406,2007-132570-0042.flac, let the recollection of your aunt's sufferings in consequence of her folly and obstinacy teach you a lesson. sign the papers. emily's resolution was for a moment odd. she shrunk at the recollections he revived.
10407,2007-132570-0000.flac," what were they disputing then? said emily. no, mum's out not fighting, but almost as good. for i believe there was not one of the senior sober"
10408,2007-132570-0017.flac," good-man,"" replied annette, and would not you be glad too to see senior valencourt? i don't know any chevrolet i like better. i have a very great regard for the senior truly."
10409,2007-132570-0048.flac," night repeated another voice. montoni paused and turned half-round, but, seeming to recollect himself, he proceeded in a lower tone. you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly."
10410,2007-132570-0037.flac," the possibility that valencourt was near her revived her fortitude, and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance, at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle. she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoni, requiring her attendance in the cedar parlor."
10411,2007-132570-0012.flac," he was as tame as could be, and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his basket. all this i saw through the keyhole. well, annette said ludovico geringly. shall i let you out now?"
10412,2007-132570-0050.flac," i could make you tremble at the bear's side. he was interrupted by a groan which seemed to rise from underneath the chamber they were in, and as he threw a glance round it, impatience and rage flashed from his eyes."
10413,2007-132570-0056.flac," quit my presence!"" cried mount tony. this affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation. ""'did you hear nothing, signor?' said emily, trembling and still unable to leave the room."""
10414,2007-132570-0014.flac," but it is expected back tonight, or tomorrow, and i shall know then perhaps."" emily inquired if she had ever heard the servant's talk of prisoners. ah, mum's cell said a net archery."
10415,2007-132570-0060.flac," whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were perhaps bringing to the castle. at length, having reached her apartment, she threw herself upon the couch, overcome with the new horrors of her situation."
10416,2007-132570-0022.flac," for, as i, when the enemy comes, what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down and fit all of a row. the enemy won't be so civil perhaps as to walk off, like the ghost, and leave them to help one another up."
10417,2007-132570-0006.flac," no, no, says he, i will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage, and up the marble staircase, and along the north gallery, and through the west wing of the castle, for you shall stay here, annette, you shall not go out of this room tonight. so."
10418,2007-132570-0016.flac," oh, lord, how glad i should be if it was so. would you indeed be glad,"" said emily in a tone of mournful reproach. to be sure i should."
10419,2007-132570-0002.flac," and fine trimmings boated no good. i guessed what they were. good god, exclaimed emily. what will become of me?"
10420,2007-132570-0033.flac," but she cannot hear them now, poor soul, said i."" emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired a net to go and make inquiry, concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle."
10421,2007-132570-0055.flac," leave the room instantly,"" said he, seeming not to notice this strange occurrence. without power to implore his pity, she rose to go, but found that she could not support herself. aw and terror overcame her, and she sunk again into the chair."
10422,2007-132570-0009.flac, and he mistook ludovico's hull for old car lows.
10423,2007-132570-0031.flac," but pray be secret, ma'am, that his exolence introduced her only to impose upon the world that had begun to make free with her character. so when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal."
10424,2007-132570-0058.flac," obey my order,"" repeated montoni, and for these fools, tricks, i will soon discover by whom they are practiced. emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her."
10425,2007-132570-0038.flac," which she obeyed with trembling, and on her way thither endeavored to animate her fortitude with the idea of valencourt. montoni was alone. ""'i sent for you,' said he, to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions."
10426,2007-132570-0023.flac," but will fall to, cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men. no, no, says i. there is reason in all things."
10427,2007-132570-0025.flac," nay, memzel, you will believe nothing. you are almost as bad as the senior himself, who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened, and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret. this was a hard part of the story."
10428,2007-132570-0020.flac," and are you indeed so simple, annette?"" said emily, smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed, as to credit these stories? credit them, mum-zel!"
10429,2007-132570-0034.flac," but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name, or that of montsuer-valencourt. ""'now i think of it, mumzel,' said annette, ""'i do believe there are prisoners, for i overheard one of the seniors' men yesterday,"
10430,2007-132570-0003.flac, if you were to go running about the castle among all these drunken seniors.
10431,2007-132570-0029.flac," were the same, or if they were whether this was valencourt. she, however, desired that a net would endeavor to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names. oh, dear mum, zeal, said a net. i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about."
10432,2007-132570-0057.flac," i heard my own voice, rejoined montoni sternly. and nothing else?"
10433,2007-132570-0026.flac," but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so than you have, ma'am. emily looked displeased and made no reply, as she mused upon the recollected appearance, which had lately so much alarmed her, and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself"
10434,2007-132570-0040.flac," if i have no right in these estates, sir,"" said emily, of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them? if the lands are yours by law, you certainly may possess them without my interference, or my consent."
10435,2007-132570-0046.flac," then all my vengeance falls upon you. he exclaimed with an horrible oath, and think not it shall be delayed."""
10436,2007-132570-0004.flac," and across the great hall, and up the marble staircase, and along the north gallery, and through the west wing of the castle, and i am in the corridor in a minute. are you so, says he, and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way?"
10437,2007-132570-0024.flac," being because it is no business of mine to look rough and fight battles. emily endeavored to correct the superstitious weakness of a net, though she could not entirely subdue her own, to which the latter only replied,"
10438,2007-132570-0041.flac," ""'i will have no more argument,' said montoni, with a look that made her tremble. what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby? but i will be trifled with no longer."
10439,2007-132570-0001.flac," and what is more, not one of those fine ladies sober either. i thought when i saw them first that all those fine silks and fine veils, white mumsel their veils were worked with silver."
10440,2007-132570-0018.flac," you regard for him cannot be doubted, said emily, since you wished to see him a prisoner. why, no, mumzel, not a prisoner, either. but one must be glad to see him, you know, and it was only the other night i dreamt."
10441,2007-132570-0035.flac, and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellence to catch up men. and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms.
10442,2007-132570-0043.flac," and from the vengeance he threatened. but then the image of valencourt, who so long had loved her, and who was now perhaps so near her, came to her heart, and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always,"
10443,2007-132570-0053.flac," i could tell you that when once my resolution is taken, but i am talking to a baby. let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples i could recite. the recital could not now benefit you."
10444,2007-132570-0010.flac," so, we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room, but the senior was as cunning as the best of us and kept calling out at the door."
10445,2007-132570-0005.flac," well, says i, if you think there is danger, then go with me and guard me. i am never afraid when you are by."" what? says he, when i am scarcely recovered of one wound, shall i put myself in the way of getting another?"
10446,2007-132570-0059.flac," but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence, past to the ramparts. as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement, emily saw a party of montoni's troops winding down a distant mountain,"
10447,8838-298545-0012.flac," for the voice was allowed in rasping one. a young man stood at the entrance, a stalky, bull-necked young minor, in tweed's sunday clothes, and an aggressive necktie. he was a sinister-looking figure, with dark, insulinised,"
10448,8838-298545-0033.flac," good lad, you'll do yet, cried perverse. gentlemen, said montgomery, i think that you will acknowledge that i have been very patient with you."
10449,8838-298545-0027.flac," and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair, a fat red hand upon either knee, and steered critically at the young assistant. so did the third visitor, falsett, the horse-breaker, who leaned back his long thin legs with their box-cloth-writing gators"
10450,8838-298545-0005.flac," his appearance and words were always vaguely benevolent. a sudden impulse came over the despondent student. he would test the reality of this philanthropy. a beg your pardon, dr. rolterker, said he, rising from his chair."
10451,8838-298545-0023.flac," said the man, and lurched out at the door. the assistant, looking after him, saw him rolling with an uncertain step down the street, until a friend met him, and they walked on arm and arm. the man seemed in his rough, northern fashion to bear no grudge."
10452,8838-298545-0010.flac, that you should have put me into the painful position of having to refuse you. he turned upon his heel and walked with offended dignity out of the surgery. the student smiled bitterly and turned to his work of making up the morning prescriptions.
10453,8838-298545-0013.flac," in the jaw and throat of a bulldog. ""'look here,' said he again. ""'why has thou not sinned to medicine who, ""'by thy master, ordered, my gumbry had become accustomed ""'to the brutal frankness of the northern worker. ""'at first it had enraged him."
10454,8838-298545-0031.flac," but training for every day working the same as training with a trainer. an idea bet with all respect to your opinion, mr. wilson, that this half-astorned talent won him at this minute. the uncan't-tie put his fingers on the assistant's upper arm."
10455,8838-298545-0004.flac," and the rule of his life was never by word or action to run a risk of offending the sentiment which had made him. his standard of respectability and of dignity was exceedingly high, and he expected the same from his assistants."
10456,8838-298545-0030.flac," have you been weighed lately, mr. montgomery? it was the first direct question which had been asked him. he had stood in the midst of them like a horse at a fair, and he was just beginning to wonder whether he was more angry or amused. i am just eleven stone,"" said he."
10457,8838-298545-0051.flac," it is the most sporting thing i have ever heard of in my life,"" said young wilson. by, george sir, if you pull it off, you've got the constituency in your pocket, if you care to stand. do you know the outhouse in my garden? next, the road? exactly."
10458,8838-298545-0020.flac," loose in his collar, and squeeze the surgery sponge over his face. he sat up at last with a gasp in his skull. ""'domni, thou spoilt my necktie,' said he, mopping up the water from his breast."
10459,8838-298545-0035.flac," for it would be something new to find isaac falsett as a spoil sport. well then, we will make up the hundred for this day among us, and the fight stands. always supposing the young man is willing. excuse all this, rahat mr. montgomery."
10460,8838-298545-0043.flac," if you can lick ted barton, you may lick the master of croxley, but if you don't, we're done. for there's no one else who is in the same street with him in this district. it's twenty rounds, two ounce gloves, queen's very rules, and a decision on points if you fight to the finish."
10461,8838-298545-0046.flac," than his brains in a year. but a chill of doubt came over him. how can i fight for the cold pits?"" said he. i'm not connected with him. hey lad, but thou art, cradle purvis. we've got it down and right, and it's clear enough"
10462,8838-298545-0040.flac," however, that's neither here nor there. montgomery looked at them and bewildered them. for goodness sake, gentlemen, tell me what it is you want me to do, he cried. we want you to fight, sir, this crags, better known as the master of crocs, thee."
10463,8838-298545-0017.flac," the blows were almost simultaneous, a savage swing which whistled past montgomery's ear, in a straight drive which took the workman on the chin. luck was with the assistant, that single whizzing uppercut, and the way in which it was delivered,"
10464,8838-298545-0003.flac," he was roused from his black meditation by the entrance of dr. older cur himself, a large, clean, jave, and respectable man, with a prim manner in an austere face. he had prospered exceedingly by the support of the local church interest."
10465,8838-298545-0048.flac," or any other shape which might suggest itself to you. you see, you are responsible for our having lost our champion. so we really feel that we have a claim upon you. give me a moment gentlemen. it is very unexpected."
10466,8838-298545-0002.flac," he should be back again at the university completing the last year which would give him his medical degree, but alas, he had not the money with which to pay his class fees. nor could he imagine how he could procure it."
10467,8838-298545-0006.flac," i have a great favor to ask of you. the doctor's appearance was not encouraging. his mouth suddenly tightened and his eyes fell. yes, mr. montgomery, you are a wearer that i need only one more session to complete my course."
10468,8838-298545-0014.flac, but after a time he had grown calistered and accepted it as it was meant. but this was something different. it was insolence. brutal overbearing insolence with physical menace behind it. what name? he housed coldly.
10469,8838-298545-0021.flac," i'm sorry i hit you so hard, sit my gunnery apologetically. thou hit me hard? i could stand such life nippin' all day. t<|ar|>"
10470,8838-298545-0039.flac," you may take it for me that he's a slaughterer, some the horsebreaker. you've taught him a lesson that he needed, for it was always a word and a blow with him, and the word alone was worth five shillin' in a public court. he won't be so ready now to shake his knees in the face of everyone he meets."
10471,8838-298545-0041.flac," but why? because ted bolton was to have fought him next saturday, he was the champion of the wilson colpitz, and the other was the master of the iron folk down at the croxley smelters. we'd matched our men for a person of a hundred against the master."
10472,8838-298545-0029.flac," 130, 150 if he's an else. well, the master doesn't scale much more than that. 175. that was when he was hog-fed and living high. worked at grease out of him and i lay there's no great difference between them."
10473,8838-298545-0011.flac," he only excelled in his strength, and where was he to find a customer for that? but the ways of fate were strange, and his customer was at hand. ""'look here,' said a voice at the door. montgomery looked up."
10474,8838-298545-0042.flac," but you've queered our man, and he can face such a battle with a two-inch cut at the back of his head. there's only one thing to be done, sir."
10475,8838-298545-0034.flac," and now i must really beg that you will have the goodness to tell me what is the matter."" they all sat down in their serious business-like way. ""'that's easy, don,' mr. montgomery,' said the fat voice, publicant. but before saying anything, we had to wait and see whether"
10476,8838-298545-0018.flac," had enough, as the assistant, breathing fiercely through his nose. but no answer came. the man was insensible. and then the danger of his position came upon montgomery, and he turned as white as his antagonist."
10477,8838-298545-0050.flac," thou rise in one day from being just a common doctor to the best known mon twix here in broadford. thou art a wither and tight thou art, and no mistake, and if thou beat the buster a croxly, thou find all the beer thou want for the rest of thy life waiting for thee at the fore sacks."
10478,8838-298545-0028.flac," no, it's all. it's not. sound of uplad, let's see this standing. it was the public in his spoke, montgomery obeyed. he would learn all about it no doubt if he were patient."
10479,8838-298545-0019.flac," a sunday, the immaculate dr. olderker with his pious connection, a savage brawl with a patient. he would irretrievably lose his situation if the facts came out. it was not much of a situation, but he could not get another without a reference"
10480,8838-298545-0049.flac," i'm afraid the doctor would never consent to my going. in fact, i am sure that he would not. but he never knows. not before the fight any rate, we are not bound to give the name of our man. so long as he is within the weight limits on the day of the fight, that is all the concerns anyone."
10481,8838-298545-0037.flac," you remember the man whom you knocked out this morning? he is barton, the famous tad barton. ""'i'm sure, sir, you may be proud to have outed him in one round,' said the publican. why, it took morris the ten-stone-six champion?"
10482,8838-298545-0001.flac," upheld the lowering, done-collared cloud-bank. for six days in the week they spouted smoke, but today the furnace fires were banked, for it was sunday. sorted in polluting gloom, hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man,"
10483,8838-298545-0045.flac, all he wanted to complete his education was lying there ready to his hand. if only that hand were strong enough to pick it up. he had thought bitterly that morning that there was no market for his strength.
10484,8838-298545-0009.flac," consider how many thousands of medical students there are in this country. no doubt there are many of them who have a difficulty in finding their fees. it might have provided for them all. or why should i make an exception in your favor? i'm grieved and disappointed, mr. montgomery."
10485,8838-298545-0044.flac," for a moment, the absurdity of the thing drove every other thought out of montgomery's head."
10486,8838-298545-0016.flac," ""'look here,' said he, turning round to the minor. your medicine will be made up and its turn is sent down to you. i don't allow folk in the surgery. wait outside in the waiting room if you wish to wait at all.' ""'young man,' said the minor."
10487,8838-298545-0007.flac," i'm afraid that my duties call me else when i'm mr. montgomery. one moment, sir. i had hopes, sir, that perhaps, if i signed a paper promising you interest upon your money, you would advance to sum to me. i will pay you back, sir. i really will."
10488,8838-298545-0015.flac," the provocation was so gross, the insult so unprovoked, that he could have none of those qualms which take the edge off a man's metal. he finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied, and he addressed it in place of carefully in the rack."
10489,8838-298545-0038.flac," a deal more trouble than that before he put barton to sleep? you've done a fine performance, sir, and happened you'll do a finer if you give yourself the chance. i never heard of ted barton, beyond seeing the name on a medicine label, said the assistant. well,"
10490,8838-298545-0000.flac," he sat in silence with his fine shoulders bowed in his head upon his hands. outside, through the grimy surgery window, over a foreground of black and brick and slate, a line of enormous chimneys like cyclopian pillars"
10491,8838-298545-0052.flac," then you'll want a sparring partner. ogilvy has been acting for barton, but we don't think that he is class enough. barton bears you no grudge. he's a good-hearted fellow, though cross-grain with strangers. he looked upon you as a stranger this morning, but he says he knows you now."
10492,8838-298545-0047.flac," it would be a very sporting thing of you, mr. montgomery, if you would come to our help when we were in such a hole. of course, you might not like to take the hundred pounds, but i have no doubt that in the case of your winning, we could arrange that it should take the form of a watch or a piece of plate."
10493,8838-298545-0032.flac," then, with his other hand on his wrist, he bent the forearm sharply, and felt the biceps, as round and hard as a cricket ball, spring up under his fingers. ""'feel that,' said he. the publican and horsebreaker felt it with an air of reverence."
10494,8838-298545-0026.flac," down for the easter vacation from magdalene college. he sat now upon the edge of the surgery table, looking in thoughtful silence at montgomery and twisting the ends of his small black waxed moustache. the second was purvis, the publican,"
10495,8838-298545-0022.flac," and now i'd be obliged to thee if thou wilt give me to wife's medicine?"" montgomery gladly made it up and handed it to the minor. ""'you are weak still,' said he. ""'wont you stay a while and rest?' ""'to wife once of medicine?'"
10496,8838-298545-0025.flac," above all, what they could expect from him was a most inexplicable problem. the first was sorley wilson, the son of the owner of the non-paryle colpet. he was a young blot of twenty, heir to a fortune, a keen sportsman,"
10497,8838-298545-0036.flac," said the university man in a genial voice. we've begun at the wrong end, i know, but we'll soon straighten it out."
10498,8838-298545-0024.flac, yet all day he was aware of a sense of vague uneasiness which sharpened into dismay when late in the afternoon he was informed that three gentlemen had called and were waiting for him in the surgery. a corner's inquest?
10499,8838-298545-0008.flac," if you like, i will work it off after i'm qualified."" the doctors' lips had thinned to a narrow line. his eyes were raised again, and sparkled indignantly. your request is unreasonable, mr. montgomery."

10526,8838-298546-0033.flac," these causeless whims and fancies are very much to be deprecated, mr. montgomery. consider how many there are to whom these very potatoes and this very beer would be most acceptable. no doubt, sir, but at present i prefer to do without them."

10544,8838-298546-0009.flac," the assistant strolled down there after tea, and asked in a casual way whether the tobacco nest had ever heard of the master of croxley."
10545,8838-298546-0034.flac," i should do a double day's work on friday so as to leave everything in order. i should hope to be back in the evening. i'm afraid i cannot spare you, mr. montgomery. this was a faceer. if he could not get leave, he would go without it."

10553,8838-298546-0002.flac," but then he had lost touch of the ring during the last few years of hard work. after all, what did it matter? if he won, there was the money which meant so much to him. if he lost, it would only mean a thrashing. he could take the punishment without flinching, of that he was certain."

10563,5514-19192-0028.flac," as repression has the army, it does not count its men, and as it has been sent, it does not count its shots. repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men, and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge boxes."

10588,5514-19192-0004.flac," in the presence of ideas which had their nights, interests had their paladins. the prosceness of the originators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement. the diminution of a pile of crowns made bankers sing the marseilles."
10589,5514-19192-0048.flac," their hope did not last long. the gleam was quickly eclipsed. and less than half an hour, what was in the air vanished. it was a flash of lightning, and accompanied by thunder. and the insurgents felt that sort of leaden cope."

10609,5514-19193-0005.flac," he is not in love, and yet he manages to be in trepid. it is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice and as bold as fire."
10610,5514-19193-0002.flac," you pain me, you are wasting your row. that's not thunder, it's a cough. and the bystanders laughed."
10611,5514-19193-0006.flac," had anyone been near him, that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice. patria."
10612,5514-19193-0004.flac," that is one way of taking our revenge for the capers that made them out reset play on us. roll on, get himself killed for angelique. all our heroism comes from our women. a man without a woman is a pistol without a trigger. it is the woman that sets the man off."
10613,5514-19193-0033.flac," he was not a child, he was not a man, he was a strange gammon fairy. he might have been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray. the bullets flew after him, he was more nimble than they. he played a fearful game of hide and seek with death."
10614,5514-19193-0000.flac," chapter 14, wherein will appear the name of angel rosnus' dress."
10615,5514-19193-0024.flac," this obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on embarikate, was useful to gavrash. beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size,"
10616,5514-19193-0015.flac," the street was filled with blinding smoke and, at the end of a few minutes, a thwart this mist all streaked with flame, two-thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons."
10617,5514-19193-0032.flac," replied to the grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and all the while went on pillaging the cartuches, emptying the cartridge boxes, and filling his basket. the insurgents panting with anxiety followed him with their eyes. the barricade trembled, he sang."
10618,5514-19193-0019.flac," the full cartridge boxes of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the slope of the reed out into his basket. what are you doing there, asked corphe rock. gavrash raised his face. i'm filling my basket, citizen. don't you see the grape shot?"
10619,5514-19193-0003.flac," who make us crazy? that is to say, brave. when a man is as much in love as a tiger,"
10620,5514-19193-0028.flac," and the sharp shooters of the ballyum, masked at the corner of the street, suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke. at the moment when gavrash was relieving a sergeant who was lying near a stone doorpost of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body."
10621,5514-19193-0035.flac," gavrush was seen to stagger, then he sank to the earth. the whole barricade gave vent to a cry, but there was something of entice in that pygmy. for the gammon to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth. gavrush had fallen only to rise again"
10622,5514-19193-0007.flac," and assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added, my name is ait pounder. in fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. this was a second piece of ordinance."
10623,5514-19193-0001.flac," continued to insult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles, which is called grape-shot, passed overhead with its terrible sound, he assailed it with a burst of irony. you are wearing out your lungs, poor brutal old fellow."
10624,5514-19193-0029.flac," fieksre, a jack-ulated gavrash, they are killing my dead men for me. a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him, a third overturned his basket."
10625,5514-19193-0017.flac," another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not be any cartridges left in the barricade. it appears that gavrash overheard this remark."
10626,5514-19193-0027.flac," for thirst said he, putting it in his pocket. by dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fuselage became transparent, so that the sharp shooters of the line ranged on the outlook behind their paving stone dike,"
10627,5514-19193-0009.flac," the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery. another cannonade was audible at some distance. at the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking the redout from the roudelash al-rei,"
10628,5514-19193-0022.flac, the smoke in the street was like a fog. whoever has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escartments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses.
10629,5514-19193-0031.flac," they aimed at him constantly and always missed him. the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him. he lay down, sprang to his feet, hidden the corner of a doorway, then made a bound, disappeared, reappeared, scampered away, returned,"
10630,5514-19193-0014.flac," and he shouted, fire on the artillery men. all were ready. the barricade which had long been silent poured forth a desperate fire. seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of rage and joy."
10631,5514-19193-0025.flac," he rifled the first seven or eight cartridge boxes without much danger. he crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket and his teeth, twisted, glided undulated, wound from one dead body to another."
10632,5514-19193-0008.flac," and placed this second piece in line with the first. this outlined the catastrophe. a few minutes later, the two pieces rapidly served, were firing point blank at the readout."
10633,5514-19193-0026.flac," and emptied the cartridge box or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut. they did not dare to shout to him to return from the varicade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him. on one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder flask."
10634,5514-19193-0030.flac," it was a charming and terrible sight. gavrash, though shot at, was teasing the fuselod. he had the air of being greatly diverted. it was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. to each discharge he retorted with a couplet."
10635,5514-19193-0010.flac, the four cannons echoed each other mournfully. the barking of these somber dogs of war replying to each other.
10636,5514-19193-0021.flac, it will be remembered that fanaco's company had left behind it a trail of bodies. 20 corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street. 20 cartouches for gavrosh meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.
10637,5514-19193-0023.flac," it rose gradually and was incessantly renewed, hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was."
10638,5514-19193-0018.flac," corphyrac suddenly caught sight of someone at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets. givrash had taken a bottle basket from the wine shop, had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying"
10639,5514-19193-0011.flac," the other balls. the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aim was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents, mingled with bursts of grape-shot."
10640,5514-19193-0013.flac," from the windows of the cabaret by grape shot, the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off. perhaps even without being seen could briskly and suddenly scale the readout."
10641,8095-274346-0021.flac," had expressed all duty and obedience in expectation that an opportunity would offer of reinstating himself in his former credit and authority. even after charles's accession, he dispaired not."
10642,8095-274346-0033.flac," but so riveted throughout the nation where the prejudices with regard to spanish deceit and falsehood, that very few of the commons seem as yet to have been convinced that they had been seduced by buckingham's narrative."
10643,8095-274346-0055.flac," tomorrow, they will attack some branch of his prerogative. by their remostruses and promises and protestations, they had engaged the crown in a war. as soon as they saw a retreat impossible, they were able to get the throne."
10644,8095-274346-0047.flac," and to show some degree of precipitancy and indiscretion. moved by this example, the house of peers were roused from their inactivity and claimed liberty for the earl of arandel, who had been lately confined in the tower."
10645,8095-274346-0049.flac," his mother, who had great influence over him, was a professed catholic. his wife was not free from suspicion."
10646,8095-274346-0053.flac," the smallest appearance of guilt could not be fixed upon him. what idea he asked must all mankind entertain of his honor, should he sacrifice his innocent friend to peculiarity considerations? what further authority should he retain in the nation?"
10647,8095-274346-0040.flac," in all christian kingdoms, you know that parliaments were in use anciently by which those kingdoms were governed in a most flourishing manner, until the monarchs began to know their own strength, and seeing the turbulent spirit of their parliaments at length"
10648,8095-274346-0039.flac," yet, less than ambiguity should remain, sir dudley carlton, vice chamberlain, took care to explain it. i pray you consider, said he, what these new councils are, or may be. i fear to declare those that i conceive."""
10649,8095-274346-0032.flac, so that it is difficult for us to give a decisive opinion with regard to these articles.
10650,8095-274346-0028.flac," by way of recrimination, bristol accused buckingham of high treason. both the earl's defense of himself and accusation of the duke remain, and together with some original letters still extant,"
10651,8095-274346-0022.flac, he submitted to the king's commands of remaining at his country seat and of absenting himself from parliament. many trials he made to regain the good opinion of his master.
10652,8095-274346-0054.flac, where he capable in the beginning of his reign to give in so signal and instance such matter of triumph to his enemies and discouragement to his adherents. today the commons pretend to rest his minister from him.
10653,8095-274346-0057.flac," of which they intended to take advantage. to such deep perfidy, to such unbounded user patience, it was necessary to oppose a proper firmness and resolution."
10654,8095-274346-0020.flac, but his urgent necessities obliged him to submit.
10655,8095-274346-0052.flac," while they retained such a plunge, besides the supply already promised, they were sure that nothing could be refused them. though, after canvassing the matter near three months, they found themselves utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the duke."
10656,8095-274346-0034.flac," a certain proof that a discovery of this nature was not, as is imagined by several historians,"
10657,8095-274346-0019.flac," and if the king either cut them short in this undertaking or refused compliance with their demands, he must not expect any supply from the commons. great dissatisfaction was expressed by charles at a treatment which he deemed so harsh and undunful."
10658,8095-274346-0018.flac," under a color of redressing grievances, which during this short reign could not be very enumerous, they were to proceed in regulating and controlling every part of government which displeased them."
10659,8095-274346-0037.flac," nothing less than fatal experience could engage the english princes to pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable assembly. the earl of suffolk, chancellor of the university of cambridge, dying about this time,"
10660,8095-274346-0029.flac," of delivering ships to the french king in order to serve against the huguenots, of being employed in the sale of honors and offices, of accepting extensive grants from the crown, of procuring many titles of honor for his kindred,"
10661,8095-274346-0027.flac," the king's prohibition was withdrawn and bristol took his seat. provolved at these repeated instances of vigor, which the court denominated controversy, charles ordered his attorney general to enter an accusation of high treason against him."
10662,8095-274346-0050.flac, so violet was the bigotry of the times that it was thought a sufficient reason for disqualifying anyone from holding an office.
10663,8095-274346-0024.flac," and in these he was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection. when the parliament was summoned, charles, by a stretch of prerogative, had given orders that no writ as his customary should be sent to bristol."
10664,8095-274346-0035.flac, the kings seemed desirous of embracing every opportunity by which he could express a contempt and disregard for them. no one was at that time sufficiently sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in the balance of the constitution.
10665,8095-274346-0056.flac," without waiting for new incidents, without covering themselves with new pretenses, they immediately deserted him and refused him all reasonable supply. it was evident that they desired nothing so much as to see him plunged in inextricable difficulties."
10666,8095-274346-0046.flac," dropped from these members. upon inquiry, it appeared that no such expressions had been used. the members were released, and the king reaped no other benefit from this attempt, than to exasperate the house still."
10667,8095-274346-0038.flac," buckingham, though lying under impeachment, was yet by means of court interest chosen in his place. the commons resented and loudly complained of this affront, and the more to enrage them, the king himself wrote a letter to the university, extolling the duke,"
10668,8095-274346-0026.flac, commanding him in the king's name to absent himself from parliament. this letter restaled conveyed to the lord and asked advice of how to proceed in so delicate a situation.
10669,8095-274346-0031.flac," the only charge which could be regarded as important was that he had extorted a sum of 10,000 pounds from the east india company, and that he had confiscated some goods belonging to french merchants on pretense of there being the property of spanish."
10670,8095-274346-0036.flac," the history of england had never hitherto afforded one instance where any great movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower house. and as their rank, both considered in a body and as individuals, was but the second in the kingdom,"
10671,8095-274346-0043.flac," these imprudent suggestions rather gave warning than struck terror. a precarious liberty, the commons thought, which was to be preserved by unlimited complacence, was no liberty at all, and it was necessary, while yet in their power,"
10672,8095-274346-0044.flac, to secure the constitution by such invincible barriers that no king or minister should ever for the future dare to speak such a language to any parliament or even entertain such a project against them.
10673,8095-274346-0051.flac," this article, together with the new impositions laid on merchandise by james, constituted near half of the crown revenues, and by depriving the king of these resources, they would have reduced him to total subjection and dependence."
10674,8095-274346-0023.flac," but finding them all fruitless and observing charles to be entirely governed by buckingham, his implacable enemy, he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court. a new spirit he saw and a new power arising in the nation."
10675,8095-274346-0042.flac," which bringeth such happiness to this nation and makes us envy devol others, while there is this sweetness between his majesty and the commons, lest we lose the repute of a free people by our turbulence in parliament."
10676,8095-274346-0030.flac, and of administering physics to the late king without equating his physicians. all these articles appear from comparing the accusation and reply to be either frivolous or false or both.
10677,8095-274346-0041.flac," they, by little and little, began to stand on their prerogatives and at last overthrew the parliaments throughout christendom."
10678,8095-274346-0025.flac," that nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition, and craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due as a peer of the realm. his writ was sent him, but accompanied with a letter from the lord keeper coventry"
10679,8095-274346-0045.flac," the commons immediately declared that they would proceed no further upon business till they had satisfaction in their privileges. charles alleged, as the reason of this measure, certain seditious expressions, which he said, had in their accusation of the duke,"
10680,8095-274346-0048.flac," after many fruitless evasions, the king"
10681,8095-274346-0017.flac, the supply was only voted by the commons. the passing of that vote into a law was reserved till the end of the session. a condition was there by maid in a very undisguised manner with their sovereign.
10682,8095-274346-0001.flac," though a determined protestant by principle as well as inclination, he had entertained no violent horror against popery, and a little humanity, he thought, was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors."
10683,8095-274346-0009.flac," the army was landed and a fort taken, but the undisciplined soldiers finding store of wine could not be restrained from the utmost successes. further stay appearing fruitless, they were reimbarked and the fleet put to sea"
10684,8095-274346-0016.flac," the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the occasion, and ill-fitted to promote those views of success and glory for which the young prince in his first enterprise so are late longed. but this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one."
10685,8095-274346-0002.flac," an abatement of the more rigorous laws was all he intended, and his engagements with france, notwithstanding that their regular execution had never been promised or expected, required of him some indulgence."
10686,8095-274346-0005.flac," they petitioned the king for replacing such able clergy as had been silenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies. they also enacted laws for the strict observance of sunday, which the puritans affected to call the sabbath"
10687,8095-274346-0011.flac," was obliged again to have recourse to a parliament. though the ill success of his enterprises diminished his authority and showed every day more plainly the imprudence of the spanish war, though the increase of his necessities"
10688,8095-274346-0004.flac, the extreme rage against popery was a sure characteristic of puritanism. the house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party.
10689,8095-274346-0012.flac," rendered him more dependent and more exposed to the encroachments of the commons, he was resolved to try once more that regular and constitutional expedient for supply. perhaps to a little political art which at that time he practiced"
10690,8095-274346-0013.flac," was much trusted to. he had named four popular leaders, sheriff's of counties, sir edward koch, sir robert phillips, sir thomas wentworth, and sir francis seymour. and, though the question had been formally much contested,"
10691,8095-274346-0006.flac, at which they sanctified by the most melancholy indolence. it is to be remarked that the different appellations of this festival were at that time known symbols of the different parties.
10692,8095-274346-0007.flac," the king, finding that the parliament was resolved to grant him no supply, and would furnish him with nothing but empty protestations of duty,"
10693,8095-274346-0008.flac, was entrusted with the command. he sailed immediately for qadis and found the bay full of spanish ships of great value. he either neglected to attack these ships or attempted it preposterously.
10694,8095-274346-0003.flac, but so unfortunate was this prince that no measure embraced during his whole reign was ever attended with more unhappy and more fatal consequences.
10695,8095-274346-0014.flac," he thought that he had by that means incapacitated them from being elected members, but his intention, being so evident, rather put the commons more upon their guard."
10696,8095-274346-0015.flac," e now of patriots still remain to keep up the ill-humour of the house, and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recommend to them practices."
10697,8095-274346-0000.flac," charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances. he was, however, in his heart extremely averse to these furious measures."
10698,8095-274346-0010.flac," with an intention of intercepting the spanish galleons. but the plague having seized the semen and soldiers, they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this prize and return to england. loud complaints were made against the court for entrusting so important a command"
10699,8095-274348-0015.flac," and both of them entrusted to the command of the duke, who was altogether unequated both with land and sea service. the fleet appeared before rochelle, but so ill-concerted were buckingham's measures that the inhabitants of that city"
10700,8095-274348-0002.flac," seems to have been encouraged by the princess, and the duke presumed so far on her good graces that after his departure he secretly returned upon some pretence and paying a visit to the queen"
10701,8095-274348-0005.flac," entirely disposed to gaity and galen tree. the cardinal's disappointment strongly inclined him to counter-work the amorous projects of his rival. when the duke was making preparations for a new embassy to paris,"
10702,8095-274348-0003.flac, was dismissed with a reproof which savored more of kindness than of anger. information of this correspondence was soon carried to rishya. the vigilance of that minister was here further roused by jealousy.
10703,8095-274348-0013.flac," the power of france, freed from this impediment, would soon become formidable to england and to all the neighboring nations. though charles probably bore but small favor to the huguenots, who so much resembled the puritans in discipline and worship,"
10704,8095-274348-0012.flac," and considered him as a prince engaged by interest as well as inclination to support them. that so long as their party subsisted, charles might rely on their attachment as much as on that of his own subjects, but if their liberties were once ravished from them,"
10705,8095-274348-0010.flac," after peace was concluded with the french king under charles's mediation, the ambitious cardinal was still meditating the destruction of the huguenots, that preparations were silently making in every province of france for the suppression of their religion."
10706,8095-274348-0006.flac, a message was sent from lewis that he must not think of such a journey. in a romantic passion he swore that he would see the queen in spite of all the power of france.
10707,8095-274348-0011.flac," that forts were erected in order to bridle rochelle, the most considerable bullwork of the protestants, that the reformed in france cast their eyes on charles as the head of their faith."
10708,8095-274348-0017.flac," hason, the vengeance of their master, exhausted their provisions in supplying their allies, and were threatened with an immediate siege."
10709,8095-274348-0000.flac, and who from a private station had mounted in the earliest youth
10710,8095-274348-0001.flac," he dared to carry his ambitious addresses to the queen herself, and he failed not to make impression on a heart not undisposed to the tender passions. that attachment at least of the mind, which appears so delicious and is so dangerous,"
10711,8095-274348-0008.flac, contrary to the articles of the marriage treaty. he encouraged the english ships of war and privateers to seize vessels belonging to french merchants.
10712,8095-274348-0016.flac, shut their gates and refuse to admit allies of whose coming they were not previously informed.
10713,8095-274348-0014.flac," in religion and politics, he yet allowed himself to be gained by these arguments enforced by the solicitations of buckingham. a fleet of a hundred sale and an army of 7,000 men were fitted out for the invasion of france."
10714,8095-274348-0007.flac," and from that moment he determined to engage england and a war with that kingdom. he first took advantage of some quarrels excited by the queen of england's attendance, and he persuaded charles to dismiss at once all her french servants"
10715,8095-274348-0009.flac," and strongly solicited charles to embrace the protection of these distressed religionists. he represented that after the inhabitants of rochelle had been repressed by the combined squadrons of england and holland,"
10716,8095-274348-0004.flac," he too, either from vanity or politics, had ventured to pay his addresses to the queen, but a priest passed middle age of a severe character and occupied in the most extensive plans of ambition or vengeance."
10717,8095-274345-0033.flac, men of such aspiring geniuses and such independent fortunes could not long deliberate. they boldly embraced the side of freedom and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prints without extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty.
10718,8095-274345-0006.flac, they were sensible that the present war was very lately the result of their own important applications and treaties and that they had solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the management of it.
10719,8095-274345-0003.flac," he lightly mentioned the occasion which he had for supply. he employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of the members. he would not even allow the officers of the crown, who had seats in the house,"
10720,8095-274345-0035.flac, are in continual fluctuation. it was as natural in their opinion and allowable for popular assemblies to take advantage of favorable incidents in order to secure the subject.
10721,8095-274345-0004.flac," and that great anticipation were likewise made on the revenues of the crown. they were not ignorant the charles was loaded with a large debt contracted by his father, who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from foreign princes."
10722,8095-274345-0027.flac," though it must be remarked that the connections with that crown were much less obnoxious to the protestants, and less agreeable to the catholics than the alliance formerly projected the spain, and were therefore received rather with pleasure than dissatisfaction."
10723,8095-274345-0024.flac," in order to fortify himself against the resentment of james, buckingham had affected popularity and entered into the cabal of the puritans. but being secure of the confidence of charles, he had since abandoned this party."
10724,8095-274345-0020.flac," the nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of taxes and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting their sovereign. even elizabeth, notwithstanding her vigor and frugality,"
10725,8095-274345-0031.flac," it would be impossible, they thought, when all these pretensions were methodized and prosecuted by the increasing knowledge of the age to maintain any shadow of popular government in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign."
10726,8095-274345-0022.flac," would not augment their number in the same proportion. the puritanical party, though disguised, had a great authority over the kingdom, and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that sect."
10727,8095-274345-0007.flac, they were equated with the difficulty of military enterprises directed against the whole house of austria. against the king of spain possessed of the greatest riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in europe.
10728,8095-274345-0032.flac," it was necessary to fix a choice, either to abandon entirely the privileges of the people, or to secure them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitution had either to provide it for them. in this dilemma,"
10729,8095-274345-0026.flac," the match with france and the articles in favor of catholics which were suspected to be in the treaty, were likewise causes of disgust to this whole party."
10730,8095-274345-0008.flac," against the emperor ferdinand, hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age, who had seduced and astonished germany by the rapidity of his victories. deep impressions they saw must be made by the english sword"
10731,8095-274345-0009.flac," and a vigorous offensive war be waged against these mighty potentates, air they would resign a principality which they had now fully subdued, at which they held in secure possession by its being surrounded with all their other territories."
10732,8095-274345-0021.flac," and the necessary wars in which she was engaged had reason to complain of the commons in this particular. nor could the authority of that princess, which was otherwise almost absolute, ever extort from them the requisite supplies."
10733,8095-274345-0005.flac," they had learned by experience that the public revenue could, with difficulty, maintain the dignity of the crown, even under the ordinary charges of government."
10734,8095-274345-0016.flac," fickle in his friendships, all men were either regarded as his enemies or dreaded soon to become such. the whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his insatiable hand, while he both engrossed the entire confidence of his master"
10735,8095-274345-0001.flac," and which lay at that time under pro-orgation. but, being told that this measure would appear unusual, he issued rits for summoning a new parliament on the 7th of may, and it was not without regret that the arrival of the princess henrietta."
10736,8095-274345-0028.flac," as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in prosecution of them. among these we may mention the names of sir edward cope, sir edwin sands, sir robert phillips, sir francis seymour,"
10737,8095-274345-0002.flac," unexperienced and impolitic, regarded as sincere all the praises and caresses with which he had been loaded while active in procuring the rupture with the house of austria. and besides that he labored under great necessities."
10738,8095-274345-0012.flac," which the present conjuncture could suggest to them. it is not to be doubted, but spleen and ill will against the duke of buckingham had an influence with many. so vast and rapid a fortune so little merited."
10739,8095-274345-0029.flac," sir dudley diggs, sir john elliott, sir thomas wentworth, mr. seldon, and mr. pym. animated with a warm regard to liberty."
10740,8095-274345-0019.flac, succeeded to all the passions and principles of their predecessors. we ought rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the kingdom during that whole period than from any circumstances which attended this particular conjuncture.
10741,8095-274345-0025.flac," and on that account was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment. though the religious schemes of many of the puritans, when explained, a pure pretty flirtiless, we are not dense to imagine that they were pursued by none but persons of weak understandings."
10742,8095-274345-0011.flac," the house of commons, conducted by the wisest and ableist senators that had ever flourished in england, thought proper to confer on the king a supply of two subsidies."
10743,8095-274345-0018.flac," the last parliament of james amidst all their joy and festivity had given him a supply very disproportion to his demand and to the occasion, and as every house of commons which was elected during forty years"
10744,8095-274345-0015.flac," his vehement temper prompted him to raise suddenly to the highest elevation his flatters and dependence, and upon the least occasion of displeasure he threw them down with equal impetuousity and violence. implacable in this hatred."
10745,8095-274345-0014.flac," his influence over the modesty of charles exceeded even that which he had acquired over the weakness of james, nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel and direction."
10746,8095-274345-0023.flac," all these were discussed in the court, both by the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty essential to their party, and on account of the restraint under which they were held by the established hierarchy."
10747,8095-274345-0013.flac," could not fail to excite public envy, and however men's hatred might have been suspended for a moment while the dukes conduct seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices, it was impossible for him long to preserve the affections of the people."
10748,8095-274345-0017.flac," and held invested in his single person the most considerable offices of the crown. however, the ill-humour of the commons might have been increased by these considerations, we are not to suppose them the sole motives."
10749,8095-274345-0030.flac," of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass. though their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and precedents favorable to king lee power, and had been able, notwithstanding, to preserve some small remains of liberty,"
10750,8095-274345-0034.flac," the end, they esteemed beneficent and noble, the means regular and constitutional. to grant or refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons, and as all human governments, particularly those of a mixed frame,"
10751,8095-274345-0010.flac," to answer, therefore, all these great and important ends, to satisfy their young king in the first request which he made them, to prove their sense of the many royal virtues, particularly economy, with which charles was in due."
10752,8095-274345-0000.flac," no sooner had charles taken into his hands the reigns of government, then he showed an impatience to assemble the great council of the nation, and he would gladly, for the sake of despatch, have called together the same parliament which had sit under his father"
10753,6081-42010-0017.flac, at the same time casting a blame on his own impatience and lack of caution.
10754,6081-42010-0028.flac," and the magistrate, finding that this last thrust had failed to produce any effect, gave up the fight in despair. irang the bell, and ordered the guard to conduct the witness back to prison."
10755,6081-42010-0035.flac," no, or i don't know. and retracted everything she had previously stated to the cock. she swore that she had been misunderstood, that her words had been misconstrued."
10756,6081-42010-0031.flac," it is quite impossible to get her to speak. she loves that rascal intensely, and he has a wonderful influence over her. you heard what he said. he threatened her with death, if she breathed the word about lushanur."
10757,6081-42010-0027.flac," as these words fell in police' ears, it was evidence his impudence and indefference had received a severe shock. he seemed confounded, and hung his head as if thoroughly abashed. still he preserved an obstinate silence."
10758,6081-42010-0011.flac," he ordered her to leave the room at once. but the poor creature was quite overcome, and trembled like a leaf. her eyes were fixed upon her unworthy husband, and the happiness she felt that seeing him again, shone plainly in her anxious gaze."
10759,6081-42010-0032.flac, and she is so terrified that there is no hope of making her speak.
10760,6081-42010-0037.flac," but remember that your strange silence injures your husband far more than anything you could say. she left the room, or rather she rushed wildly from it, as though only too eager to escape."
10761,6081-42010-0021.flac," i influence her evidence? i don't understand you."" but for that supposition your words would have been meaningless. what words? the magistrate turned to his clerk."
10762,6081-42010-0013.flac, and lifting her with his strong arms carried her out into the passage. the whole scene had been so brief
10763,6081-42010-0026.flac," be guided by me, confess everything while there is yet time, and abandon the present course which may lead you into serious danger. one may be an accomplice in more ways than one."
10764,6081-42010-0022.flac," read the last remark you took down. in a monotonous voice, the smiling clerk repeated, i should like to kill the person who dared to say that i knew lashanur."
10765,6081-42010-0012.flac," just for one second, and then she caught his withering glance, and heard his words of menace. terrorist ricken, she staggered back, and then lakok seized her around the waist."
10766,6081-42010-0030.flac," but i thought you would be waiting for me and made haste to bring her here. i thought i was acting for the best. never mind, the misfortune can be repaired. no, sir, no. since she has seen her husband."
10767,6081-42010-0025.flac, do you suppose the police are ignorant of your acquaintance with lushanur? of your conversation with him when he came in a cab to the corner of the waist-ground near your mother's wine shop? and of the hopes of fortune you based upon his promises?
10768,6081-42010-0016.flac," and word for word, if you please. he paused. the door opened again. this time to admit the magistrate's messenger, who timidly, and with a rather guilty air,"
10769,6081-42010-0023.flac," what did you mean by that? it's very easy to understand, sir."
10770,6081-42010-0034.flac," police threat had aroused the most sinister apprehensions in her mind. not understanding his connection with the affair, she asked herself if her testimony might not prove his death warrant."
10771,6081-42010-0024.flac," don't prevericate any longer,"" he said. you certainly ordered your wife not to say anything about lushanur. that's evident. why did you do so? what are you afraid of her telling us?"
10772,6081-42010-0029.flac," and to take every precaution to prevent him seeing his wife again. when police had departed, the cock re-entered the room."
10773,6081-42010-0015.flac," ah! ah! thought the smiling clerk in a flutter of delight. this is something new. but as these little diversions never made him forget his duties, he leaned toward the magistrate and asked."
10774,6081-42010-0036.flac," at last she burst into wild, despairing sobs, and pressed her frightened child against her breast. what could be done to overcome this foolish obstinacy as blind and unreasoning as abroots?"
10775,6081-42010-0033.flac, again set foot in his office. the poor creature seemed nearly heartbroken.
10776,6081-42010-0018.flac," yet obtaining the information he desired. let us proceed, he said to poulet, who had not moved since his wife had been taken from the room."
10777,6081-42010-0014.flac, was still forming the order for tuanan to be removed from the room when he found the door closed again.
10778,6081-42010-0019.flac," being to all appearances sublimely indifferent to everything passing around him. to the magistrate's proposal, he carelessly nodded a scent. was that your wife who came in just now?"
10779,6081-42010-0020.flac, why did you behave in that manner? it wasn't the time for sentiment. you are not telling the truth. you simply desired to attract her attention to influence her evidence. i?
10780,6081-42010-0001.flac," and dependent on the customers it brought them. being of a conscientious turn of mind, he entered each establishment in succession, and meeting now and again various acquaintances, he felt compelled to proper and accept."
10781,6081-42010-0007.flac," was he not bringing with him the most potent of justifications? he thought of the agreeable surprise he had in store for the magistrate, and fancied he could picture the sudden brightening of that functionary's gloomy face."
10782,6081-42010-0002.flac," numerous glances of the favorite morning beverage. white wine. turn which way he would, however, loiter as long as he might."
10783,6081-42010-0010.flac, he instantly perceived his mistake and understood its consequences. there was only one thing to be done. he must prevent any exchange of words between the two.
10784,6081-42010-0005.flac, that he delivered the order for lecoc to follow him without a minute's delay.
10785,6081-42010-0008.flac," and yet, fate so willed it that the doorkeeper's message and his urgent appeal that lacocke should not loiter on the way, produce the most unfortunate results."
10786,6081-42010-0009.flac," when he saw, however, that the magistrate was not alone, and when he recognized pulite choupin, the original of the photograph,"
10787,6081-42010-0006.flac," has asked for you a number of times,"" said he, he has been extremely impatient, and he is in a very bad humor. so you may expect to have your heads snapped off in the most expeditious manner. the cock smiled as he went up the stairs,"
10788,6081-42010-0000.flac," the first of all proceeded to the prefecture of police, going the longest way round as a matter of course, but, on reaching his destination, he could find no one who had seen the young detective. accordingly,"
10789,6081-42010-0003.flac," he was returning in haste, a trifle uneasy on account of the length of his absence, when he perceived a cab pull up in front of the palais gateway. a second glance at all great good fortune. he saw the cock."
10790,6081-42010-0004.flac," father of son, and the virtuous twanan, a light from this very vehicle. his peace of mind at once returned, and it was in a very important somewhat husky tone."
10791,6081-41997-0037.flac," but they were hurrying away as fast as they could. in what direction? oh, they were running toward the root of our hand."
10792,6081-41997-0038.flac," however, he bowed civilly to the colceiers, whom he might possibly have need of at another time, and then went back to the cab. as i had supposed they do not live here, he remarked to the driver."
10793,6081-41997-0029.flac," the vehicle was now rolling along the root of a gong, halfway down the street the driver pulled up and turning to the cock exclaimed, here we are, that's the house the hassees went into."
10794,6081-41997-0030.flac," to draw off the silk hankerchief that served him as a muffler to fold it and slip it into his pocket, to spring to the ground and enter the house indicated was only the work of an instant for the young detective."
10795,6081-41997-0019.flac," you will have time to faint when we get home. now come along."" and then she began to sob. indeed, madam, indeed i can't. she said, and really she seemed quite unable to move. in fact,"
10796,6081-41997-0026.flac," whether she was a blonde or brunette. so many questions at a time confused the driver. a stop a minute, he replied. in my opinion she wasn't pretty, and i don't believe she was young."
10797,6081-41997-0003.flac," as soon as the vehicle was well underway, the young detective proceeded to ingratiate himself into the driver's good graces, being anxious to obtain all the information that this worthy was able to impart."
10798,6081-41997-0028.flac," asked the cock, the neatly dressed one, the deuce, as for her i did not notice her at all. all i know about her is that she was very small. would you recognize her if you met her again? good heavens, no."
10799,6081-41997-0017.flac, and which was it that said the and thou?
10800,6081-41997-0002.flac," a maxim intended to assure his after fame, and which ran as follows. always suspect that which seems probable, and begin by believing what appears incredible."
10801,6081-41997-0012.flac," but to listen to all he had to say. as you may suppose, continue the coachman, i wasn't inclined to trust to such suspicious characters, alone at that hour, and in that part of the city."
10802,6081-41997-0013.flac," so, just as they were about to get into the cab, i called to them. wait a bit, my little friends. you have promised papa some sue. where are they? the one who had called after the cab at once handed me thirty francs."
10803,6081-41997-0004.flac," in a tone that implied that all trifling would be useless, the cabman cried, ""'aup, aup, cocotte,' and his mare pricked up her ears and quickened her pace, so that the rude is choisee,"
10804,6081-41997-0023.flac," in reality, social preeminence belonged to the woman who had left the large, broad footprints behind her. and not merely was she of a superior rank, but she had also shown superior energy."
10805,6081-41997-0005.flac," was speedily reached. then it was that lecocc resumed his inquiries. well, my good fellow, he began. you have told me the principal facts. now i should like the details."
10806,6081-41997-0035.flac," for fear of disturbing you. yesterday i was so busy i couldn't come. however, here i am at last and here's the handkerchief. so saying..."
10807,6081-41997-0032.flac," to which one. really, i don't exactly know. in a moment the worthy name imagined that this polite young man was making fun of her. you scamp, she began."
10808,6081-41997-0036.flac," i slipped on my dress and went out into the hall, where i saw two women hastening toward the door. before i could reach them, they slammed the door in my face. i opened it again as quickly as i could and looked out into the street."
10809,6081-41997-0021.flac," decox first suppositions. as he had suspected, the social position of the two women was not the same. he had been mistaken, however,"
10810,6081-41997-0025.flac," had a hand as small as a child, and in spite of her anger her voice was as sweet as music. did you see her face? i just caught a glimpse of it."
10811,6081-41997-0024.flac," contrary to lecox's original idea, it now seemed evident that she was the mistress and her companion the servant. is that all my good fellow? he asked the driver."
10812,6081-41997-0018.flac," she, with shabby dress and shoes, as big as a gouty man's. you should have seen her shake the prim-looking girl, as if she had been a palm tree. your little fool said she, do you want to ruin us?"
10813,6081-41997-0022.flac," in attributing the higher standing to the woman wearing the shoes with the high heels, the marks of which she had so particularly noticed in the snow, with all the attendant signs of precipitation, terror and weakness."
10814,6081-41997-0007.flac," i had been having a most unfortunate day, six hours on a stand on the boulevard, with a rain pouring all the time. it was simply awful. at midnight, i had not made more than a frank and a heck."
10815,6081-41997-0016.flac," i did notice something strange. one of the two women called the other madame, as large as life. while the other said, thee and thou, and spoke as if she were somebody."
10816,6081-41997-0034.flac," overtook me and passed on. one of them dropped this handkerchief which i picked up. i hastened after her to restore it, but before i could overtake them, they had rung the bell at your door, and were already in the house."
10817,6081-41997-0015.flac," which ran after you. the girl who was neatly dressed, the one who—the driver suddenly paused. some vivid remembrance passed through his brain, and abruptly jerking a rain's"
10818,6081-41997-0031.flac," in the concierge little room he found an old woman knitting, the cock bowed to her politely, and displaying the silk handkerchief exclaimed, �madam, i have come to return this article to one of your lodgers.�"
10819,6081-41997-0014.flac," saying, above all, make haste, your recital could not be more minute exclaimed lecoc approvingly. now, how about these two women?"
10820,6081-41997-0001.flac," and yet he did not hesitate to jump onto the box and give the signal for starting. in so doing, he obeyed a maxim which he had"
10821,6081-41997-0011.flac," i'll be for yourself."" i hesitated for a moment when the woman added, and ten francs for the fair. i then drew up. lecoc was boiling over with impatience, but he felt that the wisest course was not to interrupt the driver with questions."
10822,6081-41997-0008.flac," half for myself. but i was so wet and miserable, and the horse seemed so done up that i decided to go home. i did grumble, i can tell you. well, i had just passed the corner of the ru picard."
10823,6081-41997-0010.flac," i had already passed them when they began to call after me. i pretended i did not hear them, but one of them ran after the cab crying."
10824,6081-41997-0033.flac," excuse me, interrupted lecoc, allow me to finish. i must tell you that at about three o'clock in the morning of the day before yesterday, i was quietly returning home when two ladies who were seemingly in a great hurry,"
10825,6081-41997-0000.flac," hence, the drivers hope of finding them in the rue de vorgon."
10826,6081-41997-0006.flac, how did these two women attract your attention?
10827,6081-41997-0020.flac," she appeared to be so ill that i said to myself, here is a young woman who has drunk more than is good for her. these facts confirmed even if they corrected."
10828,6081-41997-0027.flac," but she certainly was a blonde and with plenty of hair, too. was she tall or short, stout or slender? between the two. this was very vague, and the other?"
10829,6081-41997-0009.flac," when i saw two women standing under a lamp. some little distance off. i did not pay any attention to them. for when a man is as old as i am, women go on, said la cac, who could not restrain his impatience."
10830,6081-41998-0026.flac, whom he could not perceive. has jevrolled intentionally or unintentionally failed to fulfill his promise?
10831,6081-41998-0015.flac," that lecocque managed to affect an entrance. as usual, he found among the mob a large number of girls and women, for the strange to say"
10832,6081-41998-0034.flac," suddenly, i noticed that one of them turned as white as his shirt, and calling the attention of his companions to one of the unknown victims. he whispered, gustav."
10833,6081-41998-0033.flac," went at about nine o'clock, three young men entered, arm in arm. from their manner and appearance, i judged them to be clerks in some store or warehouse."
10834,6081-41998-0043.flac," the man shook his head. no, said he."
10835,6081-41998-0024.flac," revealing the ghastly tents of the lifeless flesh, and imparting a sinister aspect to the tattered clothing hung around the room to aid in the identification of the corpses. this clothing, after a certain time, is sold."
10836,6081-41998-0031.flac," the keepers face brightened up. in that case, said he, i have a letter for you, written by your comrade, who was obliged to go away. here it is. the young detective at once tore open the envelope and read."
10837,6081-41998-0005.flac," i prefer to a light here rather than in front of the morgue,"" he said, springing to the ground. then, producing first his watch and next his purse, he added,"
10838,6081-41998-0042.flac," when finding a doorkeeper installed behind a heavy, open desk, he remarked,"
10839,6081-41998-0020.flac, for the mysterious murderer whose identity lecocque was trying to establish had furnished three victims for their delectation.
10840,6081-41998-0022.flac," as a continuous accompaniment to the exclamations, size, and whispered comments of the bystanders, became the murmur of the water trickling from a spigot at the head of each slab. a tiny stream that flowed forth high"
10841,6081-41998-0039.flac," as the old coachman urged on his horse, he could not refrain from saying, things are going on to suit you. a friendly hush was the only response."
10842,6081-41998-0041.flac," the cock had entered the left wing of the palais. he climbed the stairs till he had reached the third floor, and was about to enter the long, narrow, badly-lighted corridor."
10843,6081-41998-0013.flac," accordingly, the cock made a gesture of ascent and then hurried toward the morgue. if there was a crowd on the roadway outside, it was because the gloomy building itself was crammed full of people. indeed, the sightseers"
10844,6081-41998-0000.flac," when a mysterious crime has been perpetrated or a great catastrophe has happened, and the identity of the victims has not been established, a great day invariably follows at the morgue."
10845,6081-41998-0016.flac, to the disgusting sights and horrible emotions that repay a visit to the morgue. the shop and workgirls who reside in the neighborhood readily go out of their way to catch a glimpse of the corpses
10846,6081-41998-0018.flac," may come no further than the door, but the others enter, and after a long stare, return and recount their impressions to their less courageous companions. if there should be no corpse exhibited,"
10847,6081-41998-0002.flac," exchanging gests, well calculated to make an ordinary mortals flesh creep. as a rule, they are far less interested in the corpses laid out for public view on the marble slabs in the principal hall."
10848,6081-41998-0006.flac," we have been an hour and forty minutes, my good fellow. consequently i owe you nothing at all,"" replied the driver decidedly. but no, not a sue."
10849,6081-41998-0001.flac," the attendants are so accustomed to the horrors of the place that the most sickly sight fails to impress them. and even under the most distressing circumstances, they hasten galley, two and fro,"
10850,6081-41998-0003.flac," as the vehicle conveying lake cock reached the key,"
10851,6081-41998-0037.flac," in the meantime, watching them out of the corner of my eye. i send this note explaining my absence to the headkeeper who will give it to you. you will understand that i am going to follow these men. a. b."
10852,6081-41998-0014.flac, most of whom could see nothing at all were packed as closely as sardines.
10853,6081-41998-0035.flac," discomrades put their hands over his mouth, and one of them exclaimed, what are you about you, fool, to mix yourself up with this affair? do you want to get us into trouble? they're upon, they went out, and i followed them."
10854,6081-41998-0009.flac," the magistrate will want your evidence, and the summons will be sent to you. all right, then address it to papillon, eugene, driver."
10855,6081-41998-0028.flac," ever since opening, we have had an immense crowd. if i were master here on days like this, i would charge an admission fee of two sews ahead."
10856,6081-41998-0017.flac," which crime, accident and suicide, bring to this horrible place. a few."
10857,6081-41998-0007.flac," i am too worried already to think that i took the money these husseys offered me. it would only have served me right if the liquor i bought with it had given me the gripes. don't be uneasy about the score, and if you need a trap, use mine for nothing."
10858,6081-41998-0021.flac," and yet, a damp chill came from beyond the iron railings, while from the crowd itself rose an infectious vapor impregnated with a stench of the chloride of lime used as a disinfectant."
10859,6081-41998-0029.flac," it would bring in around some more than enough to cover the expenses. the keepers reply seemed to offer an inducement to conversation, but the cock did not seize it."
10860,6081-41998-0011.flac," you told me that you had another appointment, and that you were already late. yes, i ought to be at the palais de justice, but it is only a few steps from here. no matter."
10861,6081-41998-0025.flac," for nothing is wasted at the morgue. however, lecocke was too occupied with his own thoughts to remark the horrors of the scene. he scarcely bestowed a glance on the three victims."
10862,6081-41998-0012.flac, i will wait for you at the corner of the bridge. it's useless to say no. i've made up my mind. and i am a bright dawn. you know.
10863,6081-41998-0023.flac," only to fall and find spray upon the marble. through the small arched windows, a grey light stole in on the exposed bodies, bringing each muscle into bold relief."
10864,6081-41998-0032.flac," missur la coc. missur, this simple formula of politeness brought a faint smile to his lips."
10865,6081-41998-0030.flac," but after a moment's hesitation he ventured to inquire, are you one of them? yes, i am,"" replied lecoc, exhibiting his card in support of his assertion. and your name?"
10866,6081-41998-0040.flac," who insisted upon remaining at his orders. he succeeded at last, however, but even when he had reached the portico on the left side of the building,"
10867,6081-41998-0036.flac," but the person who had first spoken was so overcome that he could scarcely drag himself along, and his companions were obliged to take him to a little restaurant close by. i entered it myself, and it is there i write this letter."
10868,6081-41998-0038.flac," s. the handwriting of this letter was almost illegible, and there were mistakes in spelling in, well, my every line. still, its meaning was clear and exact, and could not fail to excite the most flattering hopes."
10869,6081-41998-0019.flac," if all the marble slabs are unoccupied, strange that may seem, the visitors turn hastily away with an expression of disappointment or discontent. there was no fear of their doing so, however,"
10870,6081-41998-0004.flac," the newspapers had reported the tragedy at the widow-soupans drinking then, of course, more or less correctly, and everybody wished to see the victims."
10871,6081-41998-0008.flac," till you have caught the jades. as lakok's purse was low, he did not insist. you will at least take my name and address, continue the driver. certainly."
10872,6081-41998-0010.flac," i lodge at his place because i have some small interest in the business you see."" the young detective was hastening away when papillon called him back. when you leave the morgue, you will want to go somewhere else, he said."
10873,6081-41998-0027.flac," unable to explain the cause of his comrades absence, the cock addressed himself to the head keeper. it would seem that no one has recognized the victims, he remarked. no one, and yet?"
10874,8108-274318-0002.flac," to observe accurately, or to recall afterwards precisely what it was he had seen, or in what order the incidents had taken place. he never could understand what defective vision on his part made it seem as though the cat had duplicated itself at first."
10875,8108-274318-0045.flac," noting the line of bright blue sparks that followed the motion of his hand down its back, and then they advanced together toward the corner where the dog was. smoke went first and put his nose gently against his friend's muzzle, purring while he rubbed."
10876,8108-274318-0011.flac," seemed to turn aside from the dog and direct itself upon his own person. the collie had made another spring and fallen back with a crash into the corner, where he made noise enough in his savage rage to wake in the dead before he fell to whining."
10877,8108-274318-0035.flac," the perspiration poured down his face, then, by slow degrees, the dark and dreadful countenance faded, the glamour passed from his soul. the normal proportions returned to walls and ceiling. the forms melted back into the fog,"
10878,8108-274318-0044.flac," and pawed his knees and stared besiegingly up into his face. he turned his head towards the corner, with a call he still lay, thumping his tail feebly and pathetically. john silence understood. he bent down and stroked the creatures living fur."
10879,8108-274318-0037.flac," he made certain sigils, gestures, and movements at the same time. for several minutes he continued to utter these words, until at length the growing volume dominated the whole room and mastered the manifestation of all that opposed it."
10880,8108-274318-0036.flac," and the world of rushing shadow cats disappeared once they came. and with the return of the consciousness of his own identity, john silence was restored to the full control of his own willpower, in a deep, modulated voice"
10881,8108-274318-0000.flac," it all seemed so rapid and uncalculated after that. the events that took place in this little modern room at the top of putney hill between midnight and sunrise, that dr. silence was hardly able to follow and remember it all."
10882,8108-274318-0026.flac," held his own against the dark, discarnate woman whose moda was pure evil, and whose soul was on the side of the dark powers. it was the climax that touched the depth of power within him, and began to restore him slowly to his own."
10883,8108-274318-0041.flac," and the thumping touched the depths of affection in the man's heart, and gave him some inkling of what agonies the dumb creature had suffered. next, from the shadows by the window, a somewhat shrill purring announced the restoration of the cat to its normal state."
10884,8108-274318-0023.flac," that shook him as the tempest shakes a leaf and close against his eyes, clean level with his face. he found himself staring into the wreck of a vast dark countenance, a countenance that was terrible, even in its ruin."
10885,8108-274318-0043.flac," clearly he was anxious to make amends for the mischief to which he had unwittingly lent himself, owing to his subtle and electric constitution. still uttering his sharp high perings, he marched up to his master and rubbed vigorously against his leg."
10886,8108-274318-0034.flac," and therefore of power. and, as his self-control returned to him, he gradually accomplished this purpose, even though trembling while he did so. yet the struggle was severe, and in spite of the freezing chill of the air,"
10887,8108-274318-0020.flac," the strong glamour thrown upon his imagination by some powerful personality behind the veil. but at the time, he was not sufficiently aware of this, and, as with all true glamour, was unable to grasp"
10888,8108-274318-0005.flac," the snarling of the enraged and terrified colleagues sounded sometimes so far away, the ceiling seemed to have raised itself so much higher than before, and much of the furniture had changed in appearance and shifted marvelously. it was all so confused and confusing."
10889,8108-274318-0033.flac," thos, he stood in the mainstream of evil unwittingly attracted by pender, deflecting its course upon himself, and after passing through the purifying filter of his own unselfishness, these energies could only add to his store of experience, of knowledge,"
10890,8108-274318-0042.flac," smoke was advancing across the carpet. he seemed very pleased with himself, and smiled with an expression of supreme innocence. he was no shadow cat, but real and full of his usual and perfect self-possession. he marched along, picking his way delicately."
10891,8108-274318-0032.flac," how vicariously to absorb these evil radiations into himself and change them magically into his own good purposes, and since his motive was pure and his soul fearless, they could not work him harm."
10892,8108-274318-0009.flac," he sprang upwards and forwards, working furiously with teeth and paws, and with a noise like wolves fighting. but only to dash back the next minute against the wall behind him. then, after lying still for a bit, he rose to a crouching position."
10893,8108-274318-0013.flac," walls, animals, and fire in a mist of darkness, and folding also about his own mind. other forms moved silently across the field of vision, forms that he recognized from previous experiments, and welcomed not."
10894,8108-274318-0039.flac," wherein the powers of spiritual evil worked their fel purposes. harmony was restored first of all to his own soul and then to the room and all its occupants. and after himself, the first to recognize it was the old dog lying in his corner."
10895,8108-274318-0012.flac," and directly afterwards, the doctor's own distress became intolerably acute. he had made a half-movement forward to come to the rescue when a veil that was denser than mere fog seemed to drop down over the scene, draping room."
10896,8108-274318-0017.flac," the whining of the dog sounded far away, and all about him, the cats flew busily to and fro, silently playing their tearing, rushing game of evil, weaving the pattern of their dark purpose upon the floor."
10897,8108-274318-0010.flac," as though to spring again, snarling horribly and making short half circles with lowered head, and smoke all the while meowed, piddiously, by the window as though trying to draw the attack upon himself. then it was that the rush of the whole dreadful business"
10898,8108-274318-0030.flac," by ceasing to resist, and allowing the deadly stream to pour into him, unopposed, he used the very power supplied by his adversary, and thus enormously increased his own. for the spiritual alchemy he had learned, he understood that force"
10899,8108-274318-0022.flac," something from the region of utter cold was upon him. and then, quite suddenly, through the confused mists about him, there slowly rose up the personality that had been all the time directing the battle. some force entered his being,"
10900,8108-274318-0029.flac," and power and confidence came with them. he began to breathe deeply and regularly, and at the same time to absorb into himself the force is opposed to him, and to turn them to his own account."
10901,8108-274318-0046.flac," and uttering little soft sounds of affection in his throat. the doctor lit the candle and brought it over. he saw the collie lying on its side against the wall. it was utterly exhausted, and foam still hung about its jaws. its tail and eyes responded to the sound of its name."
10902,8108-274318-0024.flac," and the mark of spiritual evil was branded everywhere upon its broken features. eyes, face and hair rose level with his own."
10903,8108-274318-0048.flac," most of them curiously misdirected. but dr. silence felt intuitively that something disastrous had happened, and his heart was wrong. he stroked the dear body, feeling it over for bruises or broken bones but finding none."
10904,8108-274318-0028.flac," the inner force is stirred and trembled in response to his call. they did not at first come readily, as was their habit, for under the spell of glamour they had already been diabolically lulled into inactivity, but come they eventually did."
10905,8108-274318-0007.flac," upon the proceedings of smoke in the collie that he only observed them, as it were, subconsciously, and the excitement, the flickering candlelight, the distress he felt for the collie."
10906,8108-274318-0021.flac," behind him, like wind booming and tearing its way down. the windows rattled, the candle flickered and went out. the glacial atmosphere closed round him with the cold of death, and a great rushing sound swept by overhead."
10907,8108-274318-0027.flac," he was conscious, of course, of effort, and yet it seemed no superhuman one, for he had recognized the character of his opponent's power, and he called upon the good within him to meet and overcome it."
10908,8108-274318-0004.flac, with brilliant green eyes flashing fire in all directions. it was like the reflections from a score of mirrors placed around the walls at different angles. nor could he make out at the time why the size of the room seemed to have altered.
10909,8108-274318-0003.flac," and then increased indefinitely so that there were at least a dozen of them darting silently about the floor, leaping softly onto the chairs and tables, passing like shadows from the open door to the end of the room, all black as sin,"
10910,8108-274318-0047.flac," but it was evidently very weak and overcome. smoke continued to rub against its cheek and nose and eyes, sometimes even standing on its body and needing into the thick yellow hair. flame replied from time to time by little licks of the tongue."
10911,8108-274318-0040.flac," flame began suddenly uttering sounds of pleasure that something between a grouse and a grunt that dogs make upon being restored to their master's confidence. dr. silence heard the thumping of the college tale against the floor, and the grunt"
10912,8108-274318-0014.flac," unholy thoughts began to crad into his brain. sinister suggestions of evil presented to himself seductively. ice seemed to settle about his heart, and his mind trembled. he began to lose memory."
10913,8108-274318-0018.flac," he strove hard to collect himself, and remember the words of power he had made use of before in similar dread positions, where his dangerous practice had sometimes led. but he could recall nothing consecutively."
10914,8108-274318-0001.flac," it came about with such uncanny swiftness and terror. the light was so uncertain, the movements of the black cat so difficult to follow on the dark carpet, and the doctor himself, so weary and taken by surprise that he found it almost impossible."
10915,8108-274318-0038.flac," for just as he understood the spiritual alchemy that can transmute evil forces by raising them into higher channels, so he knew from long study the occult use of sound and its direct effect upon the plastic region"
10916,8108-274318-0016.flac," and it was then that the room filled with this horde of cats, all dark as the night, all silent, all with the lamping eyes of green fire. the dimensions of the place altered and shifted. he was in a much larger space."
10917,8108-274318-0019.flac," amidst lay over his mind and memory, he felt dazed and his forces scattered. the deeps within were too troubled for healing power to come out of them. it was glamour, of course, he realized afterwards."
10918,8108-274318-0025.flac," he never could properly measure or determine these two, a man and a woman looked straight into each other's visages and doubt into each other's hearts. and john silence, the soul with the good, unselfish motive,"
10919,8108-274318-0008.flac," were the poorest possible allies to careful observation. at first he was only aware that the dog was repeating his short, dangerous bark from time to time, snapping viciously at the empty air, a foot or so from the ground, once indeed,"
10920,8108-274318-0031.flac," ultimately is everywhere, one and the same. it is the motive behind that makes it good or evil, and his motive was entirely unselfish. he knew, provided he was not first robbed of self-control,"
10921,8108-274318-0015.flac," memory of his identity, of where he was, of what he ought to do. the very foundations of his strength were shaken."
10922,8108-274318-0006.flac," into the dimensions of quite another chamber that came to him with its hosts of cats and its strange distances in a sort of vision. watch, these changes came about a little later, and at a time when his attention was so concentrated"
10923,8108-280359-0008.flac," air, earth, or water, there was no rest for him anywhere. tired at last of seeking what he could nowhere find, loki built himself a house near a narrow, glittering river, which, lower down, flashed from a high rock into the sea below."
10924,8108-280359-0025.flac," be able to torment the inhabitants of manheim or asgard by his evil doings. thor proposed to return to asgard to bring a chain with which to bind the prisoner, but to odin assured him that he had no need to take such a journey."
10925,8108-280359-0007.flac," or alone with dead nature, everything seemed to know him, and to find a voice in which to say to him."
10926,8108-280359-0013.flac," by making a fishing net, he spied in the distance the whole company of the gods approaching his house. the sight of them coming all together, beautiful and noble, and free, pierced loki with a pang that was worse than death."
10927,8108-280359-0006.flac," sometimes he hid himself as one among a troop of timid reindeer, sometimes he lay in the nest of a wood pigeon, sometimes he swam, a bright spotted fish in the sea. but, wherever he was, among living creatures"
10928,8108-280359-0011.flac," and she would have hidden him from the just anger of the gods if she could. what the two sons cared little about their father's dread and danger. they spent all their time inquarling with each other, and their loud, angry voices sounding above the waterfall."
10929,8108-280359-0004.flac," he climbed to the tops of misty hills, and crouched in the dark of hollow caves. but above the wood, and through the water, and down into the darkness, a single ray of calm, clear light seemed always to follow him."
10930,8108-280359-0027.flac," by their evil passions, have fought with and destroyed each other, with their sinners we must make a chain to bind their father, and from that he can never escape. it was done as asa odin said."
10931,8108-280359-0002.flac, and no measure for the deep waters. neither is there any possibility of counting the various forms under which i shall disguise myself. odin will never be able to find me.
10932,8108-280359-0016.flac," famous for his keen sight, spied out the remains of the fishing net in the fire. then odin knew at once that there was a river near, and that it was there where loki had hidden himself. he ordered his sons to make a new net, and to cast it into the water."
10933,8108-280359-0000.flac," for the future, he must bend all his cunning and vigilance to the task of hiding himself from the gaze of those whom he had so injured and escaping the just punishment he had brought upon himself."
10934,8108-280359-0001.flac," the world is large, and i am very clever,"" said loki to himself, as he turned his back upon asgard and wandered out into mannheim."
10935,8108-280359-0010.flac," alliannari came to live with him. seguna was a kind woman, far too good and kind for loki. she felt sorry for him now that she saw he was in great fear, and that every living thing had turned against him."
10936,8108-280359-0028.flac," a rope was made of the dead wolves, sinus. and as soon as it touched loki's body, it turned into bands of iron."
10937,8108-280359-0014.flac," he rose without daring to look again, through his net on a fire that burned on the floor, and, rushing to the side of the little river, he turned himself into a salmon, swam down to the deepest, stillest pool at the bottom."
10938,8108-280359-0005.flac," and he knew that it came from the eye of odin, who was watching him from ayrthrone. then he tried to escape the watchful eye by disguising himself under various shapes. sometimes he was an eagle on a lonely mountain crag."
10939,8108-280359-0015.flac," and hid himself between two stones. the gods entered the house, and looked all round and vain for loki."
10940,8108-280359-0017.flac," and drag out whatever living thing they could find there. it was done as he desired, four held one end of the net, and all the rest of the gods drew the other through the water. when they pulled it up the first time, however, it was empty, and they would have gone away disappointed."
10941,8108-280359-0021.flac," and with the greatest speed he attempted it. thor, however, was watching for him. and as soon as loki leapt out of the water, he stretched out his hand and caught him while he was yet turning in the air."
10942,8108-280359-0023.flac," at odin's first searching look, loki was obliged to drop his disguise, and, cowering and frightened, to assume his proper shape before the assembled lords. one by one they turned their faces from him, for, in looking at him,"
10943,8108-280359-0019.flac," but not so quickly, but that the gods saw him. new him through his disguise and resolved that he should no longer escape. they themselves divided into two bands, four-weighted down the river to the waterfall."
10944,8108-280359-0012.flac," would speedily have betrayed the hiding place, even if odin's piercing eye had not already found it out. at last, one day when he was sitting in the middle of his house looking alternately out of all the four doors and amusing himself as well as he could,"
10945,8108-280359-0024.flac," they seemed to see over again the death of boulder the beloved. you were told that there were high rocks looking over the senior loki's house. one of these, higher than the rest, had midway for projecting stones. and to these the gods resolved to bind loki."
10946,8108-280359-0026.flac," loki, he said, has already forged for himself a chain stronger than any you can make. while we have been occupied in catching him, his two sons, ali and nari, transformed into wolves."
10947,8108-280359-0018.flac," saw that something living had certainly touched them, they then added a weight to the net, and threw it with such force that it reached the bottom of the river and dragged up the stones in the pool. loki now saw the danger he was in of being caught in the net, and,"
10948,8108-280359-0009.flac," he took care that his house should have four doors in it, that he might look out on every side and catch the first glimpse of the gods when they came, as he knew they would come to take him away. here his wife, seguna, and his two sons,"
10949,8108-280359-0003.flac," i have no cause to fear. but though loki repeated this over and over again to himself, he was afraid. he wandered far into the thick woods and covered himself with the deep waters."
10950,8108-280359-0022.flac," loki wriggled his slippery slimy length through thor's fingers, but the thunderer grasped him tightly by the tail, and, holding him in this manner, in his hand, waited to the shore. their father odin and the other gods met him, and,"
10951,8108-280359-0020.flac," the other gods stood in a group below, low-key swam backwards and forwards between them. first he thought he would dart out into the sea, and then that he would spring over the net back again into the river. this last seemed the easiest way of escape."
10952,8108-280354-0019.flac," then at last he knew that the gods below were pitiless. end full of sorrow he returned to the upper earth. for three years,"
10953,8108-280354-0020.flac," finding his only consolation in the music of his liar, for he shunned all men and women."
10954,8108-280354-0006.flac, he resolved to make one last effort to win her back. he would go down to the lower world and seek her among the dead and try whether any prayer or persuasion could move pluto to restore his beloved. near tenoram.
10955,8108-280354-0022.flac," oak, poplar, lime, beach, laurel, ash, pine, plain, and maple, and many another tree had gathered together here, drawn from their distance, forest homes, by the sounds of orpheus's lyre."
10956,8108-280354-0024.flac," for this was one of the feasts of bacchus, and the women were celebrating his rights, wandering over the mountains with dance and revel. when they saw orpheus, they set up a shout of derision. see, they cried."
10957,8108-280354-0004.flac," was to be but short-lived, for as the new-made bride wandered through the woods with the other nymphs, a poisonous serpent stung her heel, and no remedy availed to save her. orpheus was thrown"
10958,8108-280354-0029.flac," and threw it with his liar into the river hebrus. there it floated downstream and, strange to tell, the cords gave forth a lament, and the lifeless tongue uttered words."
10959,8108-280354-0005.flac," into the most passionate grief at his wife's death. he could not believe that he had lost her forever, but prayed day and night without ceasing to the gods above to restore her to him."
10960,8108-280354-0010.flac," great lords of the world below the earth, to which all we mortals must one day come. grant me to tell a simple tale."
10961,8108-280354-0000.flac," jason had persuaded orpheus to accompany the argonauts when they went to fetch back the golden fleece. for he knew that the perils of the way would be lightened by song. to the sound of his lyre, the argo had floated down to the sea."
10962,8108-280354-0008.flac," the three-headed dog that guards the threshold of pluto. undaunted by the terrors of the place, orpheus passed through this gate, and down at dark, and dismal road to the kingdom of the dead."
10963,8108-280354-0023.flac," yes, and the beasts and the birds of the field came to, and orpheus sat in their midst, and sang and played the tunes of sorrow. suddenly, a great noise was heard of laughter and shouting and merry-making."
10964,8108-280354-0012.flac," sat on his stone till listen. never yet had such sweet strains been heard in the world of gloom. then, for the first time, tears moistened the cheeks of the theories, and even the king and queen of the dead were moved to pity."
10965,8108-280354-0031.flac, and sappho tuned afresh the liar of orpheus.
10966,8108-280354-0014.flac, nor must you once turn round to look upon her.
10967,8108-280354-0013.flac," and she came, yet halting from her recent wound. ""'take her,' says pluto, and lead her back to the light."
10968,8108-280354-0026.flac, and fell harmlessly to the ground. then the women raised a wild shout and made such a clamor with trumpets and symbols that the soft tones of the harp were drowned by the noise. now at last the shots took effect.
10969,8108-280354-0015.flac," else the boom we grant you will be but vain. a steep path led upward from the realm of darkness, and the way was hard to find through the gloom. in silence or fierce let on, till the goal was close at hand,"
10970,8108-280354-0001.flac, and he played so sweetly when they passed to the rocks of the sirens that the dreadful monsters sang their most alluring strains in vain.
10971,8108-280354-0025.flac," the wretched singer who mocks at women and will have no bride but the dead, come, let us kill him, and show that no man shall despise us unpunished. with these words, they began to throw wands and stones at him."
10972,8108-280354-0028.flac," the trees shed their leaves with grief, and the dry ads and nigh ads tore their hair and put on the garb of sorrow. only the pitiless revelers knew no remorse. they seized the singer's head."
10973,8108-280354-0017.flac," he turned to gaze on his beloved. dimly he saw her, but for the last time, for a power she could not resist through her back. orpheus stretched out his arms and tried to seize her, but he only clasped the empty air."
10974,8108-280354-0007.flac," in lyconia was a cave among dark and gloomy rocks, through which led one of the entrances to the lower world. this was the road by which hercules descended when he went to carry off cerberus."
10975,8108-280354-0002.flac," whom he loved dearly and who returned his love. but at their marriage, the omens were not favorable. hymen, the marriage god, came to it with a gloomy countenance, and the wedding torches smoked."
10976,8108-280354-0018.flac, he sat on the further bank without food or drink.
10977,8108-280354-0027.flac," and in their fury, the women fell upon him, dealing blow on blow, orphys fell lifeless to the ground. but he was not to die unwept. the little birds of the forest mourned for him. even the stony rocks wept."
10978,8108-280354-0011.flac," the lifeless ghosts came flocking. and as they heard they wept, tantalus forgot his hunger and thirst."
10979,8108-280354-0030.flac," it cried, till head and lyre were carried down to the sea, and on to lesbos, the isle of sweet song, where in after years"
10980,8108-280354-0021.flac," one day he sat down to rest on a grassy hill in the sunshine, and played, and sang to baguille his sorrow. as he played, the coolness of shady branches seemed all about him, and looking up, he found himself in the midst of a wood."
10981,8108-280354-0016.flac, and the welcoming light of the upper air began to penetrate the darkness. then a sudden fear struck his heart.
10982,8108-280354-0009.flac," here, he came in safety through the crowd of ghosts and phantoms, and stood at last before the throne of pluto and prasurpina, then he touched the cords of his lyre and chanted these words."
10983,8108-280354-0003.flac, i would not give forth a cheerful flame.
10984,5022-29405-0042.flac," to the soft profusion of his reddish-brown hair, to his finely-shaped sensitive lips, but for two marked peculiarities in him which would have shown me to be wrong. that is to say, the expression of power about his head"
10985,5022-29405-0036.flac," his daughter interfered and stopped him at the critical moment when he was actually offering his arm to conduct me in state across the kitchen. crystal had just put her pretty brown hand over his mouth and said, oh father, do pray be quiet!"
10986,5022-29405-0009.flac," for all that time. for some part of the time i answered, i was catching moths in ford witchwood."
10987,5022-29405-0014.flac," i have asked the two ladies, my lord, has an engagement to dine here today without ceremony. they are most anxious to meet you, my de gerard. you look surprised."
10988,5022-29405-0038.flac," started up frightened and took refuge under the table. at the next moment, the death larger walked into the room. it was he beyond all doubt who had frightened the dog, forewarned by instinct of his appearance."
10989,5022-29405-0039.flac," what i had read of his writing disposed me now that i saw the man by daylight to find something devilish in the expression of his face. no. strong as it was, my prejudice failed to make any discoveries that presented him at a disadvantage."
10990,5022-29405-0006.flac," i slept badly. the event that had happened since my arrival in england had excited me, i suppose. now and then, in the wakeful hours of the night, i thought of crystal with some anxiety."
10991,5022-29405-0018.flac," i must tell you that lady rachel is the eldest. she is married to the honorable captain milbe of the navy, now away in his ship. a person of extraordinary strength of mind. i don't mean the captain, i mean lady rachel."
10992,5022-29405-0025.flac," the sooner i returned it to the rider of the confession, the sooner i told him plainly the conclusion at which i had arrived, the more at ease my mind would be. the sluggish river looked muddier than ever, the new cottage looked uglier than ever,"
10993,5022-29405-0031.flac," i now saw in their full beauty the luster of her brown eyes, the warm rosiness of her dark complexion, the delightful vivacity of expression which was the crowning charm of her face. she paused confusingly in the doorway."
10994,5022-29405-0033.flac, my answer would no doubt have assumed the form of a foolish compliment if her father had not spared her that inflection.
10995,5022-29405-0001.flac," i feel at a loss how to reply. not one impression, but many impressions troubled and confused my mind. certain passages in the confession inclined me to believe that the writer was mad, but i altered my opinion at the next leaf."
10996,5022-29405-0034.flac," he says, all right, and he does nothing. there's first, as i told you just now, the truly dreadful state of the drains. i tried to stop him by promising to speak to the bailiff myself. on hearing this good news, mr. tola's gratitude became ungovernable,"
10997,5022-29405-0011.flac," of course, the bold girl can try to attract your notice. i replied that i had met with the bold girl purely by accident on her side as well as on mine, and then i started a new topic."
10998,5022-29405-0029.flac," on this old side of the house, there's first drains. he proceeded to reckon up the repairs, counting with his fleshless thumb on his skinny fingers, when he was interrupted by a curious succession of sounds, which began with whining, and ended with scratching at the cottage door."
10999,5022-29405-0023.flac," she smiled and kissed her hand and flooded out of the room, charming, perfectly charming, and yet i was ungrateful enough to wish myself back in germany again. i lit my cigar but not on the terrace."
11000,5022-29405-0021.flac," poor sir george, she refused him last week. you really must have heard of sir george, a member of parliament, conservative of course, quite broken hearted about lady lena. gone away to america to shoot bears."
11001,5022-29405-0016.flac," either i had forgotten lodop or cliff during my long absence abroad, or i had never heard of him."
11002,5022-29405-0019.flac," i admire her intellect, but her political and social opinions i must always view with regret."
11003,5022-29405-0026.flac, i knocked at the door on the ancient side of the building.
11004,5022-29405-0000.flac," time has passed since i first read it, and changes have occurred in the interval which leave me free to exercise my own discretion and to let the autobiography speak for itself. if i am asked what impression of the writer those extraordinary pages produced on me"
11005,5022-29405-0041.flac, that they had no right to be in a man's face.
11006,5022-29405-0032.flac," and tried to resist me when i insisted on relieving her of the basket. mr. girant, she protested."
11007,5022-29405-0020.flac, it's simply the most charming girl in england. if you don't fall in love with her.
11008,5022-29405-0043.flac," and the signs of masculine resolution presented by his mouth in chin. unentering the room, the first person and the only person who attracted his attention was crystal. he bowed, smiled, possessed himself abruptly of her hand and kissed it."
11009,5022-29405-0028.flac," my meals don't show on me. you will excuse my receiving you in the kitchen, sir. it's the best room we have. to christy tell you how badly we are off here for repairs. you be in our landlord. we look to you to help us. we have fallen to pieces, as it were."
11010,5022-29405-0012.flac," was it a pleasant dinner party last night, i asked, as if the subject really interested me. i had not been quite four in twenty hours in england yet, and i was becoming a humbug already."
11011,5022-29405-0003.flac," at one time, his tone and writing of his early life and his illusions to his mother won my sympathy and respect. at another time, the picture of himself in his later years and the defiant manner in which he presented it,"
11012,5022-29405-0027.flac," he stared at me in momentary perplexity, and suddenly recovering himself asked me to walk in. i used the young master, sir. ah, yes, yes, i thought so. my girl christy said she saw the young master last night. thank you kindly, sir. i'm pretty well."
11013,5022-29405-0022.flac," you want to smoke after breakfast. well, i won't be in your way. go out on the terrace. your poor father always took his cigar on the terrace. they say smoking leads to meditation. i'll leave you to meditate on lady lena. don't forget."
11014,5022-29405-0010.flac, mrs. royalake's fascinating smile disappeared when i mentioned the mill. she suddenly became a cold lady. i might even say a stiff lady.
11015,5022-29405-0013.flac," my stepmother was her charming self again the moment my question had passed my lips. society, provided it was not society at the mill, was always attractive as a topic of conversation. your absence was the only drawback, she answered."
11016,5022-29405-0037.flac," when we were all three, disturbed by another interruption. a second door communicating as i concluded from its position with the new cottage was suddenly opened. in the instant before the person behind it appeared, the dog looked that way."
11017,5022-29405-0017.flac," we will drive out after lunch and pay around to visits. when this prospect was placed before me, i remembered having read in books of sensitive persons receiving impressions which made their blood run cold."
11018,5022-29405-0007.flac," the poor girl, as i was still inclined to fear, might have serious reason to regret that he had ever entered her father's cottage. at the breakfast table, my stepmother and i met again. mrs. roy lake, in an exquisite morning dress with her smile and perfect order,"
11019,5022-29405-0008.flac, informed me that she was dying with curiosity. she had heard from the servants that i had not returned to the house until past ten o'clock on the previous night. and she was absolutely bewildered by the discovery. what could her dear gerard have been doing out in the dark by himself?
11020,5022-29405-0040.flac," his personal attractions triumphed in the clear-searching light. i now perceived that his eyes were of that deeply dark blue, which is commonly and falsely described as resembling the color of the violet. to my thinking, they were so entirely beautiful,"
11021,5022-29405-0015.flac," i was obliged to acknowledge my ignorance. mrs. royleck was shocked. at any rate, she resumed, you have heard of their father, lord apoclyph. i made another shameful confession."
11022,5022-29405-0005.flac," at one positive conclusion, as strangers he and i had first met. as strangers, i was determined we should remain. having made up my mind so far, the next thing to do with the clock on the mantelpiece striking midnight was to go to bed."
11023,5022-29405-0004.flac, almost made me regret that he had not died of the illness which had struck him death.
11024,5022-29405-0002.flac, and set him down as a man with a bitter humor.
11025,5022-29405-0024.flac," leaving the house, i took the way once more that led to ford which would. what would mrs. roy lake have said if she had discovered that i was going back to the mill? there was no other alternative. the portfolio was a trust convided to me."
11026,5022-29405-0035.flac," he was more eager than ever, and more eloquent than ever in returning to the repairs. and then said, there's the oven. they do cold-bred the staff of life. it's a burnt staff at one time and a clammy staff at another."
11027,5022-29405-0030.flac," in a minute after, the door was opened from without, a brown dog of the companionable retriever breed ran in and fond upon old toller. crystal followed from the kitchen garden with a basket of vegetables on her arm."
11028,5022-29411-0062.flac, you are deceived by a false friend who lies to you and hates you. the man she was speaking of turned the corner of the new cottage.
11029,5022-29411-0057.flac," and felt i don't doubt it. i had intended to say no more than this, but the remembrance of gludy's mysterious perverication and of the uneasiness which i had undoubtedly felt when i thought of it afterwards, led me i cannot pretend to say how,"
11030,5022-29411-0064.flac, i was left to decide for myself what should i have done if i have been 20 years older.
11031,5022-29411-0068.flac," he pointed to the grandly darkening view. the two men who could have painted the mystery of those growing shadows and fading lights, lie in the graves of rembrandt and turner. shall we go to tea? on our way to his room we stopped at the miller's door."
11032,5022-29411-0070.flac," today she's in a room praying. the warnings which i had neglected rose in judgment against me. i was silent. i was odd. before i recovered myself, crystal entered the kitchen. her father whispered."
11033,5022-29411-0069.flac," with you, inquire, he said, if miss crystal is ready. i went in. old tolla was in the kitchen, smoking his pipe without appearing to enjoy it. ""'what's come to my go,' he asked the moment he saw me."
11034,5022-29411-0063.flac," it's too late now. instead of letting me proceed her, as i had anticipated, she ran on before me, made a sign to the deaf man as she passed him, not to stop her, and disappeared through the open door of her father's side of the cottage."
11035,5022-29411-0060.flac," crystal counted the strokes. ""'seven,' she said. ""'are you determined to keep your engagement?' she had repeated in an unsteady voice, and with a sudden change in her color to paleness, the strange question put to me by gludy."
11036,5022-29411-0059.flac," i am not sure whether i have mentioned that the name of the place was kylam. it was situated behind a promontory of the riverbank, clothed thickly with trees, and was not visible from the mill. in the present direction of the wind, we could hear the striking of the church clock."
11037,5022-29411-0058.flac," into associating crystal's agitation, with something which this man might have said to her. i was on the point of putting the question, when she held up her hand and said, hush! the wind was blowing toward us from the riverside village, to which i have already alluded."
11038,5022-29411-0066.flac, his book of leaves would not have told him in my own handwriting that i believed in his better nature.
11039,5022-29411-0056.flac," in that short time. i told her that he had been found in my garden looking at the flowers. as he had done no harm, i said."
11040,5022-29411-0061.flac," in his case, i had failed to trace the motive. i tried to discover it now. tell me why i ought to break my engagement, i said. remember what i told you at the spring, she answered."
11041,5022-29411-0067.flac," explain it who can. i knew that i was going to drink tea with him, and yet i was unwilling to advance a few steps and meet him on the road. i find a new bond of union between us, he said as he joined me. we both feel that."
11042,5022-29411-0065.flac," the fear of appearing to be afraid, and that i should have made my excuses to my host of the evening. how would my moral courage have answered him if he had asked for an explanation? useless to speculate on it. had i possessed the wisdom of middle life?"
11043,5022-29411-0017.flac," you swear, sir, that he won't go at the end of his week's notice."
11044,5022-29411-0043.flac," and the lured reddening of the sun as it stooped in its setting. lovely interfusions of so-bird-color-rested, faded, returned again, on the upper leaves of the foliage as they lightly moved. the mist, rolling capriciously over the waters,"
11045,5022-29411-0044.flac," while it dimmed the turbid, earthy yellow that discolored and degraded the stream under the full glare of day. while my eyes followed the successive transformations of the view as the hour advanced, tender and solemn influences breathed their bomb over my mind."
11046,5022-29411-0052.flac," the deaf gentleman submitted, why did you invite yourself? because a tea party is not complete without a woman. her manner was as strangely altered as her looks. that she was beside herself for the moment i clearly saw."
11047,5022-29411-0029.flac," the hat i had seen on the head of that hateful woman was now sufficiently described, for a man. sly old taller, leaving gludian noticed and keeping his eye on me, saw the signs of conviction in my face, and said with his customary audacity."
11048,5022-29411-0053.flac, i know that she has visited you and spoken to you. do you know what she has said? i can guess.
11049,5022-29411-0038.flac," i failed to see it myself in that light. it struck me, as i walked home, that crystal might have made many a worse friend than the retired prize-fighter. a change in my manner was of course remarked by mrs. royalake's ready observation."
11050,5022-29411-0003.flac," it is perhaps only right to add that my patience had been tried by the progress of domestic events, which affected lady lena and myself, viewed as victims. calling with my stepmother at lord upperford's house later in the day,"
11051,5022-29411-0041.flac," on the river margin of the wood, i was confronted by a wild gleam of beauty in the familiar view, for which previous experience had not prepared me. am i wrong in believing that all scenery, no matter how magnificent or how homely it may be,"
11052,5022-29411-0026.flac," i've got burdens on my mind, he explained, or i should have thought of it too. having done justice to his own abilities, he bustled out. in less than a minute, he was back again in a state of breathless triumph. gludiest in the person, he announced, and"
11053,5022-29411-0018.flac, and shoot the man and shoot himself.
11054,5022-29411-0035.flac," pray, be kind to me then ever. pray let me be."" i said i would return on the next day and left the room with his sore heart. old taller, highly approved of my conduct. he rubbed his fleshless hands and whispered,"
11055,5022-29411-0020.flac," about crystal. after looking around the kitchen again i asked where she was. sitting for a long and a bedroom crying, her father told me, i went out for a walk by the river and i sat down and be in sunday i fell asleep. when i woke and got arm again just now that"
11056,5022-29411-0025.flac," in want of help, i said, we sometimes find it nearer than we had ventured to expect, at our own doors. the ancient miller rose at that hint like a fished at a fly. gloudy, he cried. find him at once, mr. toller."
11057,5022-29411-0011.flac, which way did i turn my steps? men will wonder what possessed me. women will think it a proceeding that did me credit. i took the familiar road which led to the gloomy wood in the guilty river. the longing in me to see crystal again was more than i could resist.
11058,5022-29411-0006.flac," neither of these anticipations was realized. once more, my clever stepmother had puzzled me. mrs. roy lake talked as fluently as ever, exhausting one commonplace subject after another."
11059,5022-29411-0024.flac," but you mean to try? yes, i mean to try. he answered me with little of the energy which generally distinguished him. perhaps he was fatigued or perhaps he had something else to think of. i offered a suggestion. when we are,"
11060,5022-29411-0009.flac," asam is his royal egg, reading a book in sad-colored binding. she was yawning over it fearfully when she discovered that i was looking at her. equal to any emergency, this remarkable woman instantly handed to me a second and similar volume."
11061,5022-29411-0033.flac," of merciless conduct of some sort. assuming this conclusion to be the right one, i determined then and there that lady rachel should not pass the doors of trimley dean again. if her bosom friend resented that wise act of severity by leaving the house, i should submit with resignation"
11062,5022-29411-0012.flac," not because i was in love with her, only because i had left her in distress. beyond the spring and within a short distance of the river, i saw a lady advancing toward me on the path which led from the mill. brisk, smiling, tripping along like a young girl,"
11063,5022-29411-0028.flac," miss crystal looked like a person surprised at seeing a stranger, what i should call a free and easy stranger, she walked in, sir, as if the place belonged to her. i am not suspicious by nature, as i hope and believe."
11064,5022-29411-0023.flac, you will ask me who the person is.
11065,5022-29411-0030.flac," o'est-she? i followed at my humble distance, the example of sir walter scott, one inquisitive people asked him if he was the author of the waverly novels. in plain english, i denied all knowledge of the stranger wearing the green hat."
11066,5022-29411-0047.flac," i thanked the little mill girl and gave her a kiss. did i feel the child's breath in my daydream still fluttering on my cheek? was i conscious of her touch? i started, trembled, returned reluctantly to my present self."
11067,5022-29411-0036.flac," you'll get it out of christy tomorrow, and i'll help you."" i found gludy waiting for me outside the cottage. he was anxious about miss crystal, his only excuse he told me, being the fear that she might be ill. having said him at ease in that particular, i said,"
11068,5022-29411-0049.flac," mr. girard, you were lost in your thoughts. i spoke and you never heard me. i looked at her in silence. was this the dear crystal so well known to me, or was it a mockery of her that had taken her place?"
11069,5022-29411-0014.flac," patronizing piety on the way to afternoon church. i must positively make a sketch of the cottage by the mill. i mean, of course, the picturesque side of it. that fine girl of tullers was standing at the door. she is really handsomeer than ever. are you going to see her, you wicked man?"
11070,5022-29411-0037.flac," you seem to be interested in miss crystal. his answer raised him a step higher in my estimation. how can i help it, sir? an odd man with a personal appearance that might excite a prejudice against him in some minds."
11071,5022-29411-0048.flac," have visible hand touched my arm. as i turned suddenly, a living breath played on my face. the child had faded into a vanishing shade, the perfect woman who had grown from her had stolen on me unawares and was asking me to pardon her."
11072,5022-29411-0019.flac," i'll be even with him, you mock my words, i'll be even with him."" that old toller, the most exasperating of men judged by a quick temper, had irritated my friend into speaking rationally was plain enough. nevertheless, i felt some anxiety."
11073,5022-29411-0004.flac," or made an opportunity of talking together confidentially in a corner. and once or twice i caught them looking at lady lena and at me. even lord uppercliff, perhaps not yet taken into their confidence,"
11074,5022-29411-0016.flac," old tolo was alone in this kitchen evidently annoyed and angry. we are all at six and seven, mr. gerard. i've had another row of fat deaf devil, my new name for him, and i think it's rather clever."
11075,5022-29411-0034.flac," and should remember the circumstance with pleasure. i am afraid you are ill-crystal, was all i could find to say, under the double disadvantage of speaking through a door, and having a father listening at my side. oh, no, mr. jura, not ill."
11076,5022-29411-0032.flac," he led me to the door of his daughter's room and stood close by, when i knocked softly and begged that she would come out. the tone of the poor girl's voice answering, forgive me sir, i can't do it! convicted the she socialist, as i thought."
11077,5022-29411-0027.flac," i beckoned to gludy, waiting modestly at the door to come in and tell me what he had discovered. i saw our outside, sir, wrapping at the door here with a parasol. that was the servant's report. her parasol."
11078,5022-29411-0005.flac," notice the proceedings of the two ladies, and seem to be at a loss to understand them. when mrs. roy lake and i were together again on our way home, i was prepared to hear the praise of lady lena, followed by a delicate examination into the state of my heart."
11079,5022-29411-0031.flac," but i was naturally desirous of discovering next what lady rachel had said, and i asked to speak with crystal. her far-seeing father might or might not have perceived a chance of listening to our conversation."
11080,5022-29411-0045.flac," days, happy days that were passed revived. again i walked hand in hand with my mother among the scenes that were round me, and learned from her to be grateful for the beauty of the earth, with the heart that felt it."
11081,5022-29411-0054.flac," her manner had become quieter. her face was more composed. her expression almost recovered its natural charm while she spoke of lady rachel. i was stupified."" ""'try, sir, to forget it and forgive it,' she resumed gently."
11082,5022-29411-0042.flac," to rives a splendor not its own from favoring conditions of light and shade. our gloomy trees and our pellant river presented an aspect superbly transfigured, under the shadows of the towering clouds, the fantastic reeds of the mist,"
11083,5022-29411-0039.flac," i told her that i had been annoyed and offered no other explanation. wonderful to relate. she showed no curiosity and no surprise. more wonderful still at every fair opportunity that offered, she kept out of my way."
11084,5022-29411-0022.flac," but mr. taller, i objected. something must have happened to distress her. has she not told you what it is? not she, upset about it. leaves me to guess. it's clear to my, my mr. draud that somebody has got it in my absence."
11085,5022-29411-0002.flac," if i had been a philosopher, i should have recognized the symptoms of a very common attack of a very widely spread moral malady. the meanest of all human infirmities is also the most universal, and the name of it is self-esteem."
11086,5022-29411-0010.flac," i looked at the book, i opened the book, i recovered my presence of mine and handed it back. if a female humbug was on one side of the window, a male humbug was on the other."
11087,5022-29411-0001.flac," still, while crystals and treaties and crystals influence had failed to shake me, glutes strange language and glutes incomprehensible conduct had troubled my mind. i felt vaguely uneasy, irritated by my own depression of spirits."
11088,5022-29411-0013.flac," behold the mock republican known in our neighborhood as lady rachel. she held out both hands to me, but for her pedicodes i should have thought i had met with a jolly young man."
11089,5022-29411-0050.flac," you have surprised me, i answered. something must have happened since i saw you last. what is it? nothing. i advanced to step and drew her closer to me. a dark, flash discolored her face. an overpowering brilliancy flashed from her eyes."
11090,5022-29411-0021.flac," was how i found her. i don't like to hear my girl crying, she's as good as gold and better. no sir, our deaf devil is not to blame for this. he has given christy no reason to complain of him. she says so herself, and she never told a lie yet."
11091,5022-29411-0007.flac," without the slightest illusion to my lord's daughter, to my matrimonial prospects, or to my visits at the mill. i was secretly annoyed, feeling that my stepmother's singular indifference to domestic interests of paramount importance,"
11092,5022-29411-0040.flac," my next day's engagement being for seven o'clock in the evening, i put mrs. royaleck's self-control to a new test. with prephatory excuses, i informed her that i should not be able to dine at home as usual. impossible as it was that she could have been prepared to hear this, i would not have been able to do it."
11093,5022-29411-0055.flac," if i've misbehaved myself, i don't rightly know what i am saying or doing. i pointed to the new side of the cottage behind us. is the cause there?"" i asked. no. no indeed."
11094,5022-29411-0000.flac," my loyalty towards the afflicted man whose friendly advances i had seen good reason to return was in no sense shaken. his undeserved misfortunes, his manly appeal to me at the spring,"
11095,5022-29411-0046.flac," we were tracing our way along our favorite woodland path, and we found a companion of tender years hiding from us. she showed herself, blushing, hesitating, offering a nose-gay of wildflowers. my mother whispered to me."
11096,5022-29411-0008.flac," returning to the house, i tried to occupy myself with my collection of insects, sadly in a gloctite of late. euceless. my own moths failed to interest me. i went back to the garden, passing the open window of one of the lower rooms which looked out on the terrace."
11097,5022-29411-0051.flac," there was an hysterical defiance in her manner. are you excited? are you angry? are you trying to start me by acting apart? i urged those questions on her one after another, and i was loudly and confidently answered."
11098,5022-29411-0015.flac," when we had lessed each other, i thought of the absent captain in the navy who was lady rachel's husband. he was a perfect stranger, but i put myself in his place and felt that i too should have gone to sea."""
11099,3374-298025-0006.flac," and now is a dignified mother, with her demure babe in her arms. i breathed the spring, and i saw clearly all about me ever lasting youth. smiling, i said to myself,"
11100,3374-298025-0012.flac," and yet, with calm presence of mind, i watched for the slightest sign of joy in you, so that not one should escape me, to impair the harming. i not only enjoyed, but i felt and enjoyed."
11101,3374-298025-0000.flac," an old man in agony, but still genial and full of delicate wit, drapes the motley spectacle of his life-like writings, with the costly tapestry of a preface, which in itself is a beautiful and romantic painting."
11102,3374-298025-0016.flac," so the calm, broad, silvery river winds along in great bends and sweeps, until yet in the lover's fantasy, cradled upon it like the swan, pass away into the distance, and lose themselves in the immeasurable."
11103,3374-298025-0021.flac," in accordance with natural laws, the misunderstandings that attack the hidden center of the loveliest existence, and to confess to you the manifold effects of my awkwardness."
11104,3374-298025-0025.flac," there is no better adaptation of means to ends than this. namely, that right at the start i begin by abolishing what we call orderly arrangement. keep myself entirely aloof from it."
11105,3374-298025-0030.flac," the selection is not difficult. for since, among the dreamy fancies which are here confined to you in permanent letters, the recollection of this most beautiful world,"
11106,3374-298025-0032.flac," for once we know to a certainty that we live in a most beautiful world, the next need is obvious."
11107,3374-298025-0001.flac," but what shall my spirit bestow upon its offspring, which, like its parent, is as poor and posy as it is rich in love? just one word, a parting trope."
11108,3374-298025-0007.flac," from this feeling or thought nothing could have turned me, neither general despair nor personal fear. for i believed"
11109,3374-298025-0019.flac," i'll accept that not long ago i was standing by the window and doing nothing, and that i am now sitting here and doing something, something which is perhaps little more than nothing, perhaps even less."
11110,3374-298025-0029.flac," it was written in a mood of impatient longing, due to my not finding you where i most surely expected to find you. in your room, on your sofa, in the haphazard birds, suggested by the pen you had lately been using."
11111,3374-298025-0008.flac," but i gladly lost myself in all those blendings and intertwines of joy and pain, from which spring the spice of life, and the flower of feeling, spiritual pleasure as well as sensual bliss."
11112,3374-298025-0004.flac," a fresh warm breath of life, and love fanned me, rustling and stirring in all the branches of the verdant grove. i gazed and enjoyed it all, the rich green, the white blossoms, and the golden fruit."
11113,3374-298025-0005.flac," and in my mind's eye i saw too, in many forms my one and only beloved. now as a little girl, now as a young lady in the full bloom, an energy of love and womanhood."
11114,3374-298025-0022.flac, i was about to describe the apprenticeship of my manhood.
11115,3374-298025-0031.flac," is the most significant, and has a certain sort of resemblance to what they call thought. i choose in preference to anything else, a death-rambic fantasy, on the most lovely of situations."
11116,3374-298025-0023.flac," a period which, taken as a whole, or in parts, i can never look back upon without a great deal of inward amusement, a little melancholy and considerable self-satisfaction."
11117,3374-298025-0028.flac," so i use my incontestable right to a confused style, by inserting here, in the wrong place, one of the many incoherent sheets which i once filled with rubbish."
11118,3374-298025-0002.flac," it is not alone the royal eagle, who may despise the croaking of the raven. the swan, too, is proud and takes no note of it."
11119,3374-298025-0003.flac, human beings and what they want and do.
11120,3374-298025-0009.flac, a subtle fire flowed through my veins.
11121,3374-298025-0024.flac," still, as a refined lover and writer, my will endeavor to refashion the course of currents and adapt it to my purpose. for me and for this book, however, for my love of it and for its inner development,"
11122,3374-298025-0013.flac," the enjoyment. you are so extraordinarily clever, dear lucinda, that you have doubtless long ear this begun to suspect that this is all nothing but a beautiful dream."
11123,3374-298025-0018.flac, all the rest is readily explained by psychology.
11124,3374-298025-0027.flac," and so inflexibly systematic. if the former also of that character, this in its way unique letter, would then acquire an intolerable unity and monotony."
11125,3374-298025-0017.flac," my vision doubtless holds the grove, and its southern color affect to the huge mass of flowers here beside me."
11126,3374-298025-0014.flac," not long ago i was standing by the window. how long i do not know. for along with the other rules of reason and morality, i completely forgot about the lapse of time. well, i was standing by the window and looking out into the open."
11127,3374-298025-0026.flac," frankly, claiming and asserting the right to a charming confusion. this is all the more necessary, inasmuch as the material which our life and love offers to my spirit and to my pen, is so incessently progressive."
11128,3374-298025-0010.flac," it was not only the wish to relieve the tormenting sting of my desire and to cool the sweet fire by gratification. it was not for your lips that i longed, or for your eyes, or for your body."
11129,3374-298025-0020.flac," i was just on the point of unfolding to you in clear and precise periods the exact and straightforward history of our frivolities, and of my dullness. i was going to expound to you step by step."
11130,3374-298025-0011.flac," amarveless mingling of memories and desires, all the mysteries of caprice in man and woman seem to hover about me. when suddenly, in my solitude,"
11131,3374-298025-0015.flac," the morning certainly deserves to be called beautiful. there is still and quite warm. and the vador here, before me, is fresh. and even as the wide land underlates in hills and dales,"
11132,3374-298026-0043.flac," and sometimes falls headlong over its own honest zeal, and speaks a word that is divine to the point of coarseness. this apology would indeed save me."
11133,3374-298026-0040.flac, i replied.
11134,3374-298026-0026.flac," and for him there come two moments of the profoundest and fullest consciousness, when all lives fall together and mingle and separate in a different way."
11135,3374-298026-0045.flac," meantime, i will by no means make common cause with him, but will rather excuse and defend my liberty and audacity by means of the example of the little innocent wilhelmina."
11136,3374-298026-0038.flac," yes, even morality, the charming morality of love."
11137,3374-298026-0023.flac, and then again come moments of sudden and universal clarity when several such spirits of the inner world completely fuse together into a wonderful wedlock. and many have forgotten bit of our ego shines forth in a new light.
11138,3374-298026-0014.flac," and we understand each other. you accompany me through all the stages of manhood, from the utmost wantoness to the most refined spirituality. in you alone, i first saw true pride."
11139,3374-298026-0017.flac," like our love, our immortal. i can no longer say my love and your love, they are both alike in their perfect mutuality. marriage is the everlasting unity and alliance of our spirits."
11140,3374-298026-0030.flac," and certainly any separation would only draw me more powerfully to you. i befink me how at our last embrace, you vehemently resisting, i burst into simultaneous tears and laughter."
11141,3374-298026-0022.flac," seems to be complete in itself, as single and indivisible as a person. one thing crowds out another, and that which just now was near and present, soon sinks back into obscurity."
11142,3374-298026-0012.flac, you recognize no separations. your being is an indivisible unity. that is why you are so serious and so joyous. why you regard everything in such a large and indifferent way?
11143,3374-298026-0000.flac, it looks at me joyously out of its deep eyes and opens its arms to embrace my spirit.
11144,3374-298026-0046.flac, since she too is a lady whom i love most tenderly.
11145,3374-298026-0039.flac," how can a man wish to write anything which it is garsely permissible to talk about, which ought only to be felt?"
11146,3374-298026-0007.flac, which might at last gratify my desire and give it rest. and then again i suddenly and sadly befink me of the gloomy time when i was always waiting without hope.
11147,3374-298026-0029.flac," weave our love ever and ever more closely and firmly together, just as a child, like an echo doubles the happiness of its gentle parents. nothing can part us."
11148,3374-298026-0006.flac," the blood rushes wildly through my swollen veins. my mouth thirsts for the contact of your lips, and my fancy seeks vainly among the many forms of joy, for one."
11149,3374-298026-0008.flac," and madly loving, without knowing it. when my innermost being overflowed with a vague longing which it breathed forth, but barely in half suppressed size."
11150,3374-298026-0009.flac," oh, i should have thought it all of fairy tale, that there could be such joy, such a love as i now feel, and such a woman who could be my most tender beloved. my best companion, and at the same time."
11151,3374-298026-0013.flac," that is why you love me, all of me, and will surrender no part of me to the state, to posterity, or to manly pleasures. i am all yours. we are closest to each other."
11152,3374-298026-0042.flac," i want at first to demonstrate to you that there exists, in the original and essential nature of man, a certain awkward enthusiasm which likes to utter boldly that which is delicate and holy."
11153,3374-298026-0001.flac," the holiest and most ever-nessant of those delicate traits and utterances of the soul, which to one who does not know the highest seem like bliss itself."
11154,3374-298026-0011.flac," you know nothing. the womanliness of your soul, aside from minor peculiarities, consists in its regarding life and love as the same thing. for you all feeling is infinite and eternal."
11155,3374-298026-0037.flac," and how you took it at the time. and i think i know just as well what you will think of it, and how you will take it here, here in this little book, in which you expect to find genuine history, plain truth, and calm reason."
11156,3374-298026-0004.flac, each idea develops a countless progeny.
11157,3374-298026-0027.flac," the time is coming when we too shall be hold in one spirit that we are blossoms of one plant, or petals of one flower. we shall then know with the smile."
11158,3374-298026-0024.flac," and even illuminates the darkness of the future with its bright luster. as it is in a small way,"
11159,3374-298026-0016.flac," would seem to mean nothing but a charming antithesis to the sublime frivolity of our marriage. why should we not take the harshest whim of chance for an excellent chest and a most frolic sum caprice? since we,"
11160,3374-298026-0021.flac," on the other side, perhaps, long in will be more completely realized. i often wonder over it, every thought, and whatever else is fashioned within us."
11161,3374-298026-0036.flac," into complete humanity. that was my dithrambic fantasy on the loveliest situation, in the loveliest of worlds. i know right well what you thought of it."
11162,3374-298026-0034.flac," we have to cool and mitigate the consuming fire with chests, and thus for us the most witty of the forms and situations of joy is also the most beautiful."
11163,3374-298026-0010.flac," a perfect friend. for it was in friendship, especially, that i sought for what i wanted, and for what i never hoped to find in any woman. and you i found it all, and more than i could wish for."
11164,3374-298026-0035.flac," it is not merely the delight of exhaustion, or the anticipation of revenge, i see in it a wonderful and profoundly significant allegory of the development of man and woman."
11165,3374-298026-0031.flac," i tried to calm myself, and in a sort of bewilderment, i would not believe that i was separated from you until the surrounding objects convinced me of it, against my will."
11166,3374-298026-0025.flac," i think, in a large way. that which we call life is for the complete inner mortal man, only a single idea, an indivisible feeling."
11167,3374-298026-0015.flac," and true feminine humility. the most extreme suffering, if it is only surrounded, without separating us."
11168,3374-298026-0033.flac, the poignant grief would be transcend and quickly resolve itself into complete harmony. how could separation separate us when presence itself is to us as it were to present?
11169,3374-298026-0002.flac, are merely the common atmosphere of our spiritual breath and life. the words are weak and vague.
11170,3374-298026-0018.flac," as that last glass of champagne we drink together. when i said, quote, and so let us drink out the rest of our lives."
11171,3374-298026-0005.flac," i remember everything, even the griefs, and all my thoughts that have been in our to-be."
11172,3374-298026-0044.flac," but perhaps only at the enormous expense of my manhood itself. for whatever you may think of my manhood in particular, you have nevertheless a great deal against the sex in general."
11173,3374-298026-0003.flac," furthermore, in this thro'ln of impressions i could only repeat a new, the one inexhaustible feeling of our original harmony. a great future beckons me on into the immeasurable."
11174,3374-298026-0019.flac," and so i say again, let us live in love. i know you would not wish to survive me. you would rather follow your dying husband into his coffin. gladly and lovingly would you descend into the burning abyss."
11175,3374-298026-0041.flac," a man feels it, he must wish to talk about it. and what a man wishes to talk about, he may write."
11176,3374-298026-0020.flac," even as the women of india do, compelled by a mad law, the cruel, constraining purpose of which desecrates and destroys the most delicate sanctities of the will."
11177,3374-298026-0032.flac, but then my longing grew again irresistible until on its wings i sank back into your arms. suppose words or a human being took create a misunderstanding between us.
11178,3374-298026-0028.flac, that what we now call merely hope was really memory. do you know how the first seed of this idea germinated in my soul before you and took root in yours?
11179,3374-298032-0020.flac," as when a person suddenly finds himself alone in the midst of immeasurable mountains of ice. everything about me and in me was cold and strange, and even my tears froze."
11180,3374-298032-0013.flac, i held my head up and cried aloud.
11181,3374-298032-0014.flac," why should you torment yourself? in a few minutes, you can be with her."
11182,3374-298032-0024.flac, so did i regard my suffering with mysterious pleasure. i regarded it as the symbol of life in general. i believed that i was seen and feeling the everlasting discord.
11183,3374-298032-0042.flac, but why poetically conceive since we find the germ of everything in ourselves and yet remain forever only a fragment of ourselves?
11184,3374-298032-0016.flac," unworthy man, you cannot even endure the trifling dissonances of this ordinary life, and yet you regard yourself as ready for and worthy of a higher life. go away and do and suffer as your calling is."
11185,3374-298032-0003.flac," since the last letter from your sister, it is three days now, i have undergone the sufferings of an entire life from the bright sunlight of glowing youth to the pale moonlight of a seduous old age."
11186,3374-298032-0025.flac," in the lovely forms of refined culture seemed dead and trivial to me, in comparison with this monstrous world of infinite strength and of unending struggle and warfare."
11187,3374-298032-0023.flac," and as a delicate spirit often grows melancholy in the very lap of happiness over its own joy, and at the very act of its existence becomes conscious of the futility of it all."
11188,3374-298032-0000.flac, the children are justified when they peep so curiously and timidly at a company of unknown faces. each individual atom of everlasting time is capable of comprising a world of joy.
11189,3374-298032-0022.flac, i hated everything earthly and was glad to see it all punished and destroyed. i felt so alone and so strangely.
11190,3374-298032-0006.flac," my state of mind was really very disconsolate. now for the first time i understood what it really was, being newborn by the joyful news that you are well again."
11191,3374-298032-0032.flac," because every earthly sentiment was entirely strange to me, and the feeling never left me that i was consecrated to death."
11192,3374-298032-0009.flac," now and then the pale face smiled and seemed to sleep, just as it had looked the last time i saw it. then of a sudden the different memories all became confused."
11193,3374-298032-0026.flac," even into the most hidden depths of existence. on account of this remarkable feeling, sickness acquired the character of a peculiar world complete in itself."
11194,3374-298032-0039.flac," then you appeared to me, back and with the summons of death."
11195,3374-298032-0041.flac," and only in that way does the human being become one in a complete entity, that is, by regarding and poetically conceiving himself as a center of everything, and the spirit of the world."
11196,3374-298032-0028.flac," this feeling also clung to me and completely separated me from other men. just as i was sunnered from the earth by the thought of your nature and my love, had been too sacred."
11197,3374-298032-0036.flac," finally, i became conscious that it was now nearly over. the braw was no longer smooth, and the locks were becoming grey. my career was ended, but not completed."
11198,3374-298032-0035.flac," and the one eternal and indivisible humanity. all existence was an uninterrupted, divine service of solitary love."
11199,3374-298032-0029.flac," it seemed to me that all was right, so, and that your unavoidable death was nothing more than a gentle awakening after a light sleep. i too thought that i was awake when i saw your picture."
11200,3374-298032-0027.flac,"艾 felt that its mysterious life was richer and deeper than the vulgar health of the dreaming sleepwalkers all around me. and with the sickness, which was not at all unpleasant,"
11201,3374-298032-0040.flac," and earnest longing for you and for freedom seized me. i yearned for my dear old fatherland, and was about to shake off the dust of travel, when i was suddenly called back to life by the promise and reassurance of your recovery."
11202,3374-298032-0004.flac," every little detail she wrote about your sickness, taken with what i had already gleaned from the doctor and had observed myself, confirmed my suspicion that it was far more dangerous than you thought."
11203,3374-298032-0019.flac," and for that reason i suspect, if i am not mistaken, i have already imparted my suspicion to you that the next life will be larger, and in the good as well as in the bad. stronger, wilder, bolder, and more tremendous."
11204,3374-298032-0002.flac," i understand now the old fairy tale about the man whom the sorcerer allowed to live, a great many years, and a few moments, for i know by my own experience the terrible omnipotence of the fantasy."
11205,3374-298032-0012.flac, now a piercing pain from dark suns burned me with an insupportable glare. now a beautiful radiance hovered about as if to entice me. then i seemed to feel a fresh breath of morning air fan me.
11206,3374-298032-0015.flac," i was already hastening to you when suddenly a new thought held me back, and i said to my spirit."
11207,3374-298032-0021.flac," wonderful worlds appeared and vanished before me in my uneasy dream. i was sick and suffered great pain, and i loved my sickness, and welcomed the suffering."
11208,3374-298032-0010.flac," with unbelievable rapidity the outlines changed, re-assumed their first form, and transformed themselves again and again, until the wild vision vanished."
11209,3374-298032-0030.flac," whichever more transfigured itself into a cheerful, diffused purity, sirius and yet charming, quite you and yet no longer you, the divine form irradiated by a wonderful light."
11210,3374-298032-0011.flac," only your holy eyes remained in the empty space and hung their motionless, even as the friendly stars shine eternally over our poverty."
11211,3374-298032-0038.flac," stood ever unattainable before me. i should have dispeared had i not perceived and idolized both in you, gracious madonna, and you and your gentle godliness in myself."""
11212,3374-298032-0001.flac, and at the same time of opening up a fathomless abyss of pain and suffering.
11213,3374-298032-0007.flac, i did not think of it as about to happen in the future or even in the present. everything was already past. for a long time you had been wrapped in the bosom of the cold earth.
11214,3374-298032-0031.flac," now it was like the terrible gleam of visible omnipotence, now like a soft ray of golden childhood."
11215,3374-298032-0018.flac," is it not to you also remarkable how everything on this earth moves toward the center, how orderly everything is, how insignificant and trivial? so it is always seemed to me."
11216,3374-298032-0005.flac," indeed, no longer dangerous, but decided, past hope. lost in this thought, and my strength entirely exhausted, on account of the impossibility of hurrying to your side,"
11217,3374-298032-0017.flac, and then present yourself again when your orders have been executed.
11218,3374-298032-0033.flac," the years pass slowly by, and deeds and works advanced laboriously to their goal, one after the other. a goal that seemed as little mine as the deeds and works seemed to be what they are called."
11219,3374-298032-0008.flac," flowers had started to grow on the beloved grave, and my tears had already begun to flow more gently. mute and alone i stood, and saw nothing but the features i had loved and the sweet clanses of the expressive eyes."
11220,3374-298032-0034.flac," to me, they were merely holy symbols, and everything brought me back to my one beloved."
11221,3374-298032-0037.flac," the best strength of life was gone, and still art and virtue."
11222,1867-148436-0027.flac," and i won't ask much cash to boot. i began wondering what pa was driving at, but i didn't say nothing, just held myself together and waited. look over there to the corral,"" says pa, and point it."
11223,1867-148436-0023.flac," he was a sure enough tenderfoot, least wise he looked at it, and he talked it, but he wasn't. the familiarity of this description made steve set up a trifle straighter. was he a ringer? maybe, i don't know."
11224,1867-148436-0040.flac, thinking up new ways of raising hell.
11225,1867-148436-0006.flac," do you think i'm on somebody's trail? don't you know i've been through with that sort of game for a hell of a while. when rock's turned into hammond eggs, i'll trust you, steve. i'll tell you what i'd done to bard anyway. yesterday."
11226,1867-148436-0037.flac," ah, $25 is enough, says pa. alright, says the tender foot. here's the money. any counts it out and pa's hand. he says, what a little beauty. it would be a treat to see him work on a polo field. pa says."
11227,1867-148436-0008.flac," only it takes about three days to get to eldera. maybe you think that interests me. it don't. logan overlooked this rejoinder saying, is it his scalp you're after? your ideas are like nest eggs, logan."
11228,1867-148436-0003.flac, i suppose you're here asking after bard.
11229,1867-148436-0025.flac," the boy paused to remember, and then, with twinkling eyes, he mimicked. that's very good of you, sir, but i'll only stop to make a trade with you. this horse and some cash to boot for a durable mount out of your cruel."
11230,1867-148436-0000.flac," xii. the first day. mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him, and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter. the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog."
11231,1867-148436-0019.flac," recognizing the true western breed, even in this small addition, nash grand. speaking man to man's son, i didn't think that, but i thought i'd sort of feel my way. which i'll say you're lucky you didn't try to feel your way with pa."
11232,1867-148436-0011.flac," he sounds like a tenderfoot, but he ain't a tenderfoot. feeling that this parting shot gave him the honors of the meeting, he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs, overhearing, stood still and gazed at his master."
11233,1867-148436-0004.flac, bard? who's he? logan considered the other with a sardonic smile.
11234,1867-148436-0005.flac," you'll wear out the snapper on it. i'm on my way to the a-circle y. listen, i'm all for old man drew. you know that. tell me what bard has on him. never heard the name before. did he wrestle a couple of your sheep?"
11235,1867-148436-0007.flac," then he hinted around about learning the way to eldera, because he knows that town is pretty close to drew's place, i guess. i told him, sure i did. he should have gone due west, but i sent him south. there is a south trail."
11236,1867-148436-0015.flac," feed him grain. no, you won't put him up. i'll tend to that. looks like a badden. that's it."
11237,1867-148436-0016.flac," unsaddled him, and gave him a small feed. the horse first rolled on the dirt floor, and then started methodically on his father. having made sure that his mount was not off his feed, nash rolled a cigarette, and strolled back to the house with the boy."
11238,1867-148436-0035.flac, and team down the bruises after joe laid him cold on the ground.
11239,1867-148436-0012.flac, his eastern course nash pursued for a mile or more.
11240,1867-148436-0024.flac, pa meets him at the door and asks him in.
11241,1867-148436-0033.flac," and he always used to win out. in fact, he was known for it all around these parts. he begun nice and easy."
11242,1867-148436-0017.flac," where's the folks, he asked? ma's sick a little, and didn't get up today. pause down to the corral, cousin mad, but i can cook you up some chow. all right, son. i got a dollar here that'll buy you a pretty good store knife."
11243,1867-148436-0044.flac," there wouldn't be no brawn card to get the boys around the house no more. but you're looking sort of sleepy, stranger. i am, answered nash. well, if you'd seen that show, you wouldn't be thinking of sleep, not for some time. maybe not."
11244,1867-148436-0010.flac," what you say cuts both ways, steve. this filler barred."
11245,1867-148436-0028.flac," it's the best horse i've ever had. it was the best horse pau ever had, too. it was a pie-balled pinto called joe, after my cousin josiah, who's just a plain baddened and raises hell when there's any excuse. the pie-balled"
11246,1867-148436-0045.flac," but the point is, i didn't see it. do you mind if i turn in on that bunk over there? help yourself, said the boy. what time do you want me to wake you up? never mind. i wake up automatic. so long, bud."
11247,1867-148436-0018.flac, the boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw-colored hair seemed positively white. maybe you want to pay me? he suggested fiercely. maybe you think we're squatters at runa hotel.
11248,1867-148436-0029.flac, he didn't even need an excuse. you see?
11249,1867-148436-0042.flac," and as lips twisted back, the same smile he had when he got into the saddle. but pretty soon, i suppose joe had a chance to figure out that it didn't do him no particular harm to be alone. the minute he seen that he stopped fighting,"
11250,1867-148436-0014.flac, hello young fella. low stranger. what's the chance of pumpkin here for three or four hours and getting a good feed for the hoss? never better. give me the hoss.
11251,1867-148436-0001.flac," and where the slopes pitch sharply down, it wound among the rocks with a faultless shurness of foot. certainly the choice of nash was well made, an eastern horse of blood over a level course,"
11252,1867-148436-0021.flac," i was just thinking of pa. what's he so about? come out short at poker lately? no, he lost a horse. ha ha ha. he explained."
11253,1867-148436-0022.flac," nash sipped his coffee and waited. on the mountain desert, one does not draw out a narrator with questions."
11254,1867-148436-0026.flac," the brute has gone lame, you see."
11255,1867-148436-0030.flac," when he leaves the corral, he likes to have another horse for a run and mate. and he was just as tame as anything. i could ride him. anybody could ride him. but if you take him outside the bars of the corral without company, first thing he'd done"
11256,1867-148436-0039.flac," but he didn't see none. then the circus started. and believe me, it was some circus. joe hadn't had much action for some time."
11257,1867-148436-0009.flac, and you set over them like a hen. they look like eggs. they feel like eggs. but they don't never hatch. that's the way with your ideas. they look all right. they sound all right. but they don't mean nothing. so long.
11258,1867-148436-0013.flac," he was weary, like his horse, and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed. he let the pony go on at the same tireless jog, clinging like a bulldog to the trail. about midday"
11259,1867-148436-0036.flac," well, this tenderfoot, he looks over the horse and the caravan says,"
11260,1867-148436-0031.flac, when he's seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself
11261,1867-148436-0032.flac, which joe can raise more hell for his size than any horse i ever seen. he's what you call an educated bucker. he don't fool around with no pauses. he just starts in and figures out a situation.
11262,1867-148436-0038.flac, then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the grin off my face. down goes the tender foot and takes his saddle and flops it on the pie-balled pinto. and the pie-balled was just as nice as milk. then he leads him out of the corral and gets on.
11263,1867-148436-0002.flac," but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail. dawn came while they wound over the crest of the ridge, and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade. it was well into the morning before nash reached logan."
11264,1867-148436-0041.flac," which maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performing, because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle. he was. and he never pulled leather. no sir, he never touched the buck and strap, but just sat there with his teeth set."
11265,1867-148436-0020.flac," and set about frying ham and making coffee. this, with crackers, formed the meal. he watched nash eat for a moment of solemn silence, and then the foreman looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster. let me in on the joke, son. nothing."
11266,1867-148436-0043.flac," and started off at a gallop, the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go, which was over there. damn my eye, says pa."
11267,1867-148436-0034.flac," and the end was the right or line on the ground. whenever the boys round here wanted any excitement, they used to come over and try their hands with joe."
11268,1867-154071-0012.flac," there stood carolyn smith in the door of the house. she closed the door behind her and walking to the top of the steps, paused there, and looked up and down the street. bill gregg groaned."
11269,1867-154071-0011.flac," peering through the slit between the drawn curtains, which sheltered him from being observed at his spying. when he called out softly, the sound brought greg, with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window. there could be no shadow of a doubt about it."
11270,1867-154071-0001.flac," found a big double room that ran across the whole length of the house. from the back, it looked down on the lights glimmering on the black east river and across to the flare of brooklyn. to the left, the whole arc of the 59th street bridge was exposed."
11271,1867-154071-0005.flac," ghost hours of the early morning, they did not relax their vigil."
11272,1867-154071-0034.flac, ain't that something done? after you've done all that?
11273,1867-154071-0017.flac," the same distinction between their clothes was in their faces, the finely-modeled prettiness of her features and the big, careless chiseling of the features of bill greg. ronikidun did not wonder that after her first fear, her gesture was one of disdain and surprise."
11274,1867-154071-0000.flac, chapter 8. 2 operations
11275,1867-154071-0035.flac," not you, bill. you're going to buck up and go ahead full steam."
11276,1867-154071-0014.flac," and so swift was that descent, that when the girl, idling down the steps across the street, came onto the sidewalk, bill greg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her."
11277,1867-154071-0037.flac," do you know what she said? well, bill greg, she says, i don't remember any such name. that took the wind out of me. i only had enough left to say."
11278,1867-154071-0043.flac," you gotta get that gent i've seen grinning from the window. grining? ask bill greg? grinding his teeth and starting from his chair? was the skunk laughing at me? sure, every minute. bill greg groaned. i'll smash every bone in his ugly head."
11279,1867-154071-0028.flac," after that, he did not move so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply. his legs were twisted awkwardly, sprawling across the floor in front of him, one long arm dragged down toward the floor."
11280,1867-154071-0018.flac," he went a long, slow, step closer to her, with both his hands outstretched."
11281,1867-154071-0036.flac, bill greg smiled sourly.
11282,1867-154071-0004.flac, go on back to sleep. i'll call you again if anything happens.
11283,1867-154071-0010.flac," one week was decided on as a fair test. if, at the end of that time, carolyn smith did not come out of the house across the street, they could conclude that she did not stay there."
11284,1867-154071-0002.flac, here they took up the vigil.
11285,1867-154071-0008.flac," and he grew pale at the thought. partner said ronikidun, if they are trying to keep her away from us, they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days. ain't that right?"
11286,1867-154071-0022.flac, the girl hesitated a moment.
11287,1867-154071-0013.flac," snatched his hat and plunged through the door, and ronik he heard the brief thunder of his feet down the first flight of stairs. then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing."
11288,1867-154071-0027.flac," now, in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood, he had lost her, and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair."
11289,1867-154071-0021.flac," the nose was hooked like the nose of a bird of prey. the eyes were long and slanting like those of an oriental. the face was thin, almost fleshless, so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a death's head."
11290,1867-154071-0025.flac," what a contrast between the ascent and the descent. he had literally flown down. now his heels clumped out as slow and regular death-march as he came back to the room. when greg opened the door,"
11291,1867-154071-0007.flac," by this time, the nerves of the two watchers were shattered by the constant strain, and the monotonous view from the front window was beginning to madden them. its proof that she ate yonder said bill greg."
11292,1867-154071-0019.flac, rani kidun followed that glance and he saw all hidden save a profile of the face.
11293,1867-154071-0020.flac," what a face it was. never in his life had ronniki dunes seen a man who, in one instant, filled him with such fear and hatred, such loathing and such dread, such scorn and such terror."
11294,1867-154071-0023.flac," for she made a slight outward gesture with one hand. if this were in her mind, however, it vanished instantly. she turned with a shutter and hurried away down the street."
11295,1867-154071-0003.flac," bill greg shook his head. that's not the one. she's all different. a pile different, ronniki. ronniki's side."
11296,1867-154071-0026.flac, ronnicky dune blinked and drew in a deep breath at the side of the poor fellow's face. greg had known before that he truly loved this girl whom he had never seen.
11297,1867-154071-0032.flac, said greg huskily. ain't there? that's where you and me don't agree.
11298,1867-154071-0042.flac," she looked like she'd run after you and try to explain. but the fear of that fellow up in the window was too much for her, and she didn't dare. bill?"
11299,1867-154071-0009.flac," it's just about our last chance, bill. we've done our hunting pretty near as well as we could. if we don't land or this trip, i'm about ready to give up."
11300,1867-154071-0031.flac," said ronnyky-doon, bill, look me in the eye and tell me man to man the cheerleyer. he added, can you ever be happy without her, man? the cruelty of that speech made greg flush."
11301,1867-154071-0044.flac, shake said roniky dune. that's the sort of talk i wanted to hear.
11302,1867-154071-0033.flac," look at the way things have gone. you start out with the photograph of a girl. now we follow her, founder name."
11303,1867-154071-0039.flac," and then she looks back over her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house. do you know why she looked back over her shoulder? just for the reason i told you. no, bill. there was a gent standing up there at the window watching her and how she acted."
11304,1867-154071-0006.flac," apparently, the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality. not a sign of carolyn smith appeared, even during the second day."
11305,1867-154071-0041.flac," that sent out the girl with the exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and speak to her when you see her. bill, with that girl told you didn't come out of her own head. it come out of the head of the genocross the way. when you turned your back on her,"
11306,1867-154071-0030.flac," said bill gregg faintly. now we hit the back trail and forget all about this."" he added with a faint attempt at cynicism. i've just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine. that's all."
11307,1867-154071-0024.flac," as for bill greg, he bore himself straight as a soldier and came back across the pavement, but it was the erectness of a soldier who had met with a crushing defeat and only preserves an outward resolution while all the spirit within is crushed."
11308,1867-154071-0029.flac," as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor-hardened hands, his chin was fallen against his breast. when ronniki dune crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder he did not look up. it's ended."
11309,1867-154071-0015.flac," for never had the miners seem so clumsily big and gaunt. never had his clothes seem so unpressed and shapeless, while his soft grey hat, to which he still clung religiously, appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast to the slim prettiness of the girl."
11310,1867-154071-0038.flac," the gent that was writing those papers to the correspondent school to you from the west. the one you sent your picture to and sent my picture to, she says, and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet. you're mad, she says."
11311,1867-154071-0016.flac," she wore a black straw hat, turned back from her face, with a single big red flower at the side of it."
11312,1867-154071-0040.flac, he's the one who's kept her in that house.
11313,1867-154075-0019.flac, he knew every line in that sharp profile. thank you.
11314,1867-154075-0030.flac," relief, wonder, and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the eyes of john mark. carolyn, you came for that? suddenly he laughed heartily, but there was a trimmer of emotion in that laughter."
11315,1867-154075-0002.flac," you followed his trail. up the stairs to the kitchen, and down the hall, and up to harry's room. we already knew he'd gone there. but he left that room again, and came down the hall. yes?"
11316,1867-154075-0003.flac, and where did it lead? right to this room. ronnicky stepped from among the smooth silks.
11317,1867-154075-0017.flac," he was brought up with a shock by the sight of roniky's big cold, held at the hip, and covering him with absolute certainty. ruth tolliver did not cry out, but every muscle in her face and body seemed to contract."
11318,1867-154075-0022.flac," i don't know,"" said ronnicky dune, smiling faintly at the coolness of the other. what do you think about it? meaning that i'm liable to put an end to your stay? maybe. tush, tush."
11319,1867-154075-0024.flac," ronniki dunes smiled again. you just obliged me, partner. he replied in his own soft voice. just stay away from the walls of the room. don't even sit down. stand right where you are."
11320,1867-154075-0037.flac," heavensman, i can't persuade her to go with a stranger at night. surely you see that. i'll do the persuading,"" said ronniki doon calmly. and when you're on the streets with the girl,"
11321,1867-154075-0038.flac," do you suppose i'll rest idle and let you walk away with her? once we're outside of the house, mark, said ronnicky dune. i don't ask no favors. let your men come on."
11322,1867-154075-0007.flac," the man grouted some retort and left, closing the door heavily behind him, while ronniki dune, breathed freely again for the first time. now said the man of the sneer, tell me the whole of it, ruth. ronniki said his teeth."
11323,1867-154075-0004.flac," the time had almost come for one desperate attempt to escape, and he was ready to shoot to kill. a moment of pause had come, a pause which, in the imagination of veronica,"
11324,1867-154075-0006.flac," you fool, they simply grew dim when they got to this door. i've been here for some time. go back and tell them to hunt some more. go up to the attic and search there. that's the place an amateur would most likely hide."
11325,1867-154075-0035.flac," this carolyn smith may be a person of great value to me. i have no doubt she is, but i got a good argument."
11326,1867-154075-0021.flac," though i wasn't playing my hand at eve's dropping. i couldn't help hearing you, partner. the man of the sneer looked him over leisurely. western, he said, at last, decidedly western. are you staying long in the east, my friend?"
11327,1867-154075-0005.flac, that's a likely story. i can show you the tracks.
11328,1867-154075-0042.flac," at the same time, a flush of excitement and fierceness passed over the face of john mark. ronikidun, taken utterly by surprise, was at a great disadvantage."
11329,1867-154075-0045.flac," that brought a start from john mark, and a flash of eagerness, but he repressed the idea after a single glance at the girl. we've shaken hands, he admitted slowly, as though just realizing the full extent of the meaning of that act."
11330,1867-154075-0033.flac," leave this house, and take a ride or a walk with me. as much as that, if you have to talk to her, why not do the talking here? i don't know,"" replied ronniki dunne. i figure she'd think too much about you all the time."
11331,1867-154075-0013.flac," although you were glad to see him, you warned him that it was dangerous to play with fire. fire being me. do i gather the drift of the story fairly well? finally, you have him worked up to the right pitch."
11332,1867-154075-0027.flac," i see that you have a most determined cavalier. i suppose he'll instantly abduct you and sweep you away from beneath my eyes."" she made a vague gesture of denial. go ahead,"" said the leader. by the way."
11333,1867-154075-0008.flac," had the clever devil guessed at the truth so easily? had he sent his follower away, merely to avoid having it known that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved? go on, the leader was repeating, let me hear the whole truth."
11334,1867-154075-0032.flac," and he brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and cool. very well then, it seems i've made an ass of myself. but i'll try to make up for it. now what about carolyn?"
11335,1867-154075-0039.flac," i ain't terrible backward with the trigger-finger, john mark. not that i figure on bragging, but i want you to pick good men for my trail and tell them to step soft. is that square?"
11336,1867-154075-0001.flac," that dropped him into the coal bin. did he get coal dust on his shoes? right, and he didn't have sense enough to wipe it off. an amateur, a rank amateur, i told you, said the man of the sneer with satisfaction."
11337,1867-154075-0043.flac," a great rage came into the eyes of john mark. a great wonder came into the eyes of the westerner. where did john mark get his sudden strength? well, said ronniki, we've shaken hands, and now you can do what you please."
11338,1867-154075-0040.flac," suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain,"" said ronnicky. you send for carolyn smith. i'm to do the persuading to get her out of the house. we're safe to the doors of the house. the minute we step into the street,"
11339,1867-154075-0012.flac," my dear girl. john began ruth tolliver, her voice shaking. tush, he broke in as smoothly as ever. let me tell the story for you, and spare you your blushes."
11340,1867-154075-0000.flac, chapter xii. the strange bargen. roniki drew is gun-and-waited. good said the man of the sneer. go ahead. it was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks.
11341,1867-154075-0028.flac," my name is john mark. i'm dune. some call me ronniki dune. i'm glad to know you, ronniki dune. i imagine that name fits you. now tell me the story of why you came to this house. of course it wasn't to see a girl."
11342,1867-154075-0026.flac," i'd kill you like a snake stranger, which i mostly think you are. so step light and step quick when i talk. certainly said the other, bowing, i am entirely at your service. he turned a little to ruth."
11343,1867-154075-0015.flac," yes, said the girl unevenly. that is, ah, murmured the man of the sneer. you seem rather relieved that i have guessed he left the house. in that case, raniqi dune had held the latch of the door turn back for some time."
11344,1867-154075-0036.flac," the gun, partner. and if you couldn't get the girl, but see how absurd the whole thing is, ronnicky doon? i send for the girl. i request her to go down with you to the street and take a walk because you wish to talk to her."
11345,1867-154075-0031.flac," the perfect torture, which had been ringing the soul of the man with the sneer, projected through the laughter. i asked your pardon, my dear,"" said john mark teruth. i should have guessed. you found him. he confessed why he was here. you took pity on him."
11346,1867-154075-0010.flac, you smiled so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here. the only way he could get in was by stealth. is that right?
11347,1867-154075-0009.flac," i, i, stammered the girl and she could say no more. the man of the sneer laughed unpleasantly. let me help you. it was somebody you met somewhere."
11348,1867-154075-0016.flac," now he pushed it open and stepped out. he was only barely in time, for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction, since there was only one hiding place in the room."
11349,1867-154075-0034.flac," yes, i have a curious stock of useless information. well, you're right, i'm going to try to get her back to bill. but you can't expect me to ascent to that. i sure do. and why?"
11350,1867-154075-0025.flac," you'd murder me if i took another step, ask the man of the sneer, and a contemptuous and sardonic expression flitted across his face for the first time. i'd sure blow you full of lead,"" said ronnicky, fervently."
11351,1867-154075-0018.flac," as if she were preparing herself for the explosion. ""'you don't have to put up your hands,' said ronnicky dune, wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer. he had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance.'"
11352,1867-154075-0023.flac," i suppose ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot about what a terrible fellow i am. but i don't use poison, and i don't kill with mysterious x-rays. i am, as you see, a very quiet and ordinary sort."
11353,1867-154075-0044.flac," sit down, leave the room, anything."
11354,1867-154075-0029.flac," you're wrong, it was. ah, in spite of himself the face of john mark wrinkled with pain and suspicious rage. i came to see a girl, and her name i figure is carolyn smith."
11355,1867-154075-0014.flac, you show him that it is possible.
11356,1867-154075-0011.flac," so he came in exactly that way, like a robber, but really only to keep a trist with his lady love. a pretty story, a true romance."
11357,1867-154075-0020.flac," i congratulate you on your good taste. a regular apollo, my dear ruth, he turned back to ronniki dune. and i suppose you have overheard our entire conversation. the whole lot of it said ronniki."
11358,1867-154075-0041.flac," you're free to do anything you want to get either of us. will you shake on that? for a moment, the leader hesitated. then his fingers closed over the extended hand of ronikidun and clamped down on them like so many steel wires contracting."
11359,328-129766-0096.flac," other than embracing me, as i say, in his arms, no, not the whole night, but rose up and dressed him in the morning, and left me as innocent for him as i was the day i was born."" this was a surprising thing to me."
11360,328-129766-0047.flac," which he was sorry for, assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity, but merely to assist me if there was any occasion. but since i..."
11361,328-129766-0016.flac," but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly, and that, as i had no settled income, so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death, and this gave me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts."
11362,328-129766-0003.flac," we had an indifferent good voyage until we came just upon the coast of england, and where we arrived in two and thirty days. but we're then ruffled with two or three storms."
11363,328-129766-0053.flac," oh, widow says she, i have bad news to tell you this morning. what is that?"" said i. are the virginia ships taken by the french? for that was my fear. no, no, says she."
11364,328-129766-0005.flac, where though it was remote from our port.
11365,328-129766-0043.flac," and she again used to tell me, she believed it was so from the beginning. however, she used to tell me that she thought i ought to expect some gratification from him for my company. for indeed, he did, as it were, and grossed me, and i was seldom from him."
11366,328-129766-0019.flac," where men find a mistress sometimes, but very rarely look for a wife, and consequently, all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way. i had spent the first season well enough."
11367,328-129766-0034.flac, the winner before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house.
11368,328-129766-0048.flac," in need of any assistance. he had but one thing more to desire of me, and that was that i would promise him that when i was anyway straightened, or like it to be so, i would frankly tell him of it, and that i would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer."
11369,328-129766-0038.flac," and that i awaited at that, till the next virginia fleet should arrive, by which i expected considerable effects. i understood by him, and by others of him, that he had a wife, but that the lady was distempered in her head, and was under the conduct"
11370,328-129766-0036.flac, if i might believe him was to him.
11371,328-129766-0051.flac," though i was secretly very glad of his offer. some weeks passed after this, and still i never asked him for money, when my landlady, a cunning creature, who had often pressed me to it, but found that i could not do it,"
11372,328-129766-0011.flac," that set me up formally for a fortune, she was dead, and her husband also, as i was informed, upon sending a person unknown to inquire. the looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to bristol, enduring my attendance upon that affair,"
11373,328-129766-0070.flac," and, in a word, press me to buy better."
11374,328-129766-0062.flac," at the words in ser and asking him if i had ever given him any answers, which were not sincere, i promised him i would. why then, his request was, he said to let him see my purse."
11375,328-129766-0086.flac," and when he grew quite well, he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care, and, as he called it, for hazarding my life to save his. and now he made deep protestations of a sincere, involable affection for me."
11376,328-129766-0037.flac," and he has such an opinion of my virtue that, as he often professed, he believed if he should offer anything else, i should reject him with contempt. he soon understood for me that i was a widow, that i had arrived at bristol from virginia by the last ships."
11377,328-129766-0045.flac, and she did so. i managed it so dexterously.
11378,328-129766-0029.flac," and as i had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition, and the great loss i have received."
11379,328-129766-0027.flac," here, i say, i pass the winter as heavily as i had passed the often cheerfully."
11380,328-129766-0006.flac," the isle of britain, i resolved to venture it no more upon the waters, which had been so terrible to me, so getting my clothes and money on shore with my bills of loading and other papers. i resolved to come for london."
11381,328-129766-0059.flac," but i suppose she wanted what i owed her, which was about eight guineas, which i had resolved to give her, and had, accordingly."
11382,328-129766-0013.flac," has had been my case before. the bath is a place of gallantry enough, expensive, and full of snares. i went to their, indeed,"
11383,328-129766-0041.flac," as a man of honor and of virtue, as well as of great estate. and indeed i had a great deal of reason to say so of him, too, for though we lodged both on a floor, and he had frequently come into my chamber, even when i was in bed,"
11384,328-129766-0063.flac, i immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing to him pulled it out and there was in it three guineas and a half.
11385,328-129766-0093.flac," he decently went out of the room until i was in bed, and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room, but lay there talking to me a great while. at last, repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me, and not offer me the least injury,"
11386,328-129766-0042.flac," and i also, into his, when he was in bed, yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss, or so much as solicited me to anything tell long after, as you shall hear."
11387,328-129766-0091.flac," in coming into that room said very frankly to him, sir, it is not of my business to inquire whether the lady be her spouse or no."
11388,328-129766-0098.flac," that though i was to him the most agreeable woman in the world, yet, because he loved me, he could not injure me."
11389,328-129766-0052.flac, makes a story of her own inventing and comes in.
11390,328-129766-0054.flac, but the man you sent to bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he is brought none. now i could by no means like her project.
11391,328-129766-0097.flac," and perhaps may be so to others, who know how the laws of nature work, for he was a strong, vigorous, brisk person, nor did he act thus unappreciable of religion at all, but of mere affection, insisting on it."
11392,328-129766-0065.flac," where i had about six guinea's more, and some silver, and threw it all down upon the bed, and i told him there was all my wealth, honestly, to a shilling. he looked a little at it, but did not tell it."
11393,328-129766-0083.flac," as it is apparent that i have done in other cases in this account, but i affirm that through all of this conversation, abating the freedom of coming into the chamber when i or he was in bed, and abating the necessary offices."
11394,328-129766-0020.flac," for though i had contracted some acquaintance with the gentleman who came to the bath for his diversion,"
11395,328-129766-0072.flac," and that he thought i had married it from him by giving him my company so entirely as i had done. after this, he made me take a maid and keep host."
11396,328-129766-0095.flac," if he had not made those promises at all, so after a little struggle, as i said, i lay still and let him come to bed. when he was there he took me in his arms, and so i lay all night with him, but he had no more to-do with me, or offered anything to me,"
11397,328-129766-0049.flac," adding that i should always find i had a true friend, though perhaps i was afraid to trust him. i admitted nothing that was fit to be said by one indefinitely obliged to let him know that i had a due sense of his kindness."
11398,328-129766-0056.flac," said, i, for i assure you he brought me all the money i sent him for, and here it is,"" said i, pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it. and added, i intend you shall have most of it by and by. he seemed just tasted a little at her talking."
11399,328-129766-0078.flac," in a litter to the bath, where there was more help and better advice to be had. he consented, and i brought him to the bath, which was about a fifteen miles as i remember. here he continued very ill of a fever."
11400,328-129766-0064.flac," not by a great deal. well, then, he said, he would have me promised to go and fetch him all the money i had, every farthing. i told him i would, and i went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer."
11401,328-129766-0021.flac," as it might be called. i resisted some casual offers of gallantry, and had managed that way well enough. i was not wicked enough to come into the crime, for the mere vice of it, and i had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which i wanted."
11402,328-129766-0008.flac," the breaking of her main mass, she had great damage on board, and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled. i had now a new scene of life upon my hands, and a dreadful appearance it had. i was come away with a kind of final farewell."
11403,328-129766-0082.flac," however, at last he grew better and gave hopes that he would recover, as indeed he did, though very slowly. were it otherwise then what i am going to say, i should not be backward to disclose it."
11404,328-129766-0004.flac," got some refreshment on shore and put to sea again, though we met with very bad weather again in which the ships sprung her main mast, as they called it, for i knew not what they meant. but we got it last into milford haven, in wales."
11405,328-129766-0022.flac," i contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house i lodged, who though she did not keep an ill-house as we call it, yet had none of the best principles in herself. i had, on all occasions, behaved myself so well,"
11406,328-129766-0090.flac," to have no lodging in the end, but in one large chamber with two beds in it."
11407,328-129766-0069.flac," and carried all home into my own chamber. i related this story, the more particularly because of the good humor there was in it, and to show the temper with which we conversed."
11408,328-129766-0014.flac," but i must do myself justice, as to protest i knew nothing amiss."" i meant nothing but in an honest way, nor had i any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards i suffered them to be guided."
11409,328-129766-0025.flac, there was no more in it. i had many melancholy hours at the bath after the company was gone.
11410,328-129766-0068.flac," when i had done so, he made me put them into my lap and took my little drawer."
11411,328-129766-0085.flac," and i would have removed my pallipet, but he would not let me tell he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him. and then i removed to my own chamber."
11412,328-129766-0032.flac," and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her, to so lower price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me, and as for lodging during the winter i paid nothing at all."
11413,328-129766-0039.flac," of her own relations, which he consented to, to avoid any reflections that might, as was not unusual in such cases, be cast on him for mismanaging her cure. and in the meantime, he came to the bath to divert his thoughts."
11414,328-129766-0050.flac," and indeed, from that time, i did not appear so much reserved to him, as i had done before. though, still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides, but how free so wherever our conversation was, i could not arrive to that sort of freedom."
11415,328-129766-0088.flac," as he would defend it if i was assaulted by a ravisher. i believed him, and told him i did so, but this did not satisfy him. he would, he said."
11416,328-129766-0057.flac," as she did at first, as well as i, taking it, as i fancied he would, as something forward of her. but when he saw me give such an answer, he came immediately to himself again. the next morning we talked to it again, when i found he was fully satisfied."
11417,328-129766-0092.flac," which drew quite across the room and effectively divided the beds. well, says my friend, very readily, these beds will do, and as for the rest, we are too near a kin to lie together, though we may lodge near one another."
11418,328-129766-0002.flac," as you shall hear in its time. i came away for england in the month of august, after i had been eight years in that country, and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me, which perhaps few women have gone through the life of."
11419,328-129766-0076.flac," called shepton, where he had some business and was there taken very ill, and so ill that he could not travel. so he sent his men back to bath to beg me that i would hire a coach and come over to him. before he went,"
11420,328-129766-0067.flac," but i knew not how much. he took the drawer and, taking my hand, made me put it in and take a whole handful. i was backward at that, but he held my hand hard in his hand."
11421,328-129766-0061.flac," before he said he had something to say to me, which was of some moment. after some very kind expressions, he asked me if i would be very honest to him, and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me."
11422,328-129766-0040.flac," from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was. my landlady, who of her own accord, encouraged the correspondence on all occasion, gave me an eventatious character of him,"
11423,328-129766-0007.flac," the port, whether she was bound, was to bristol, where my brother's chief correspondent lived. i got to london in about three weeks, where i heard a little while after that the ship was arrived in bristol."
11424,328-129766-0000.flac, and so might mary again when he would.
11425,328-129766-0028.flac," of what lay hardest upon my mind, and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances, and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea. i told her also that i had a mother and a brother in virginia, and good circumstances,"
11426,328-129766-0060.flac," he was in might-good humor when he heard me say i had paid her, and went off into some other discourse at that time. but the next morning, he having heard me up about my room before him, he called to me, and i, answering, he asked me to come into his chamber."
11427,328-129766-0024.flac," for a wicked correspondence. if they had any of them offered it, yet there was one gentleman as above, who always singled me out for the diversion of my company, as he called it, which, as he was pleased to say, was very agreeable to him. but at that time,"
11428,328-129766-0026.flac," and for recruits of money, yet i chose to come back to bath for my residence. because being on good terms with the woman in whose house i lodged in the summer, i found that during the winter i lived rather cheaper there"
11429,328-129766-0058.flac," and smiling said he hoped i would not want money and not tell him of it, and that i had promised him otherwise. i told him i had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady's talking, so publicly the day before, of what she had nothing to do with."
11430,328-129766-0073.flac," which i did very willingly, believing, as it appeared, that i should lose nothing by it, nor did the woman of the host fail to find her account in it, too. we had lived thus near three months, when,"
11431,328-129766-0017.flac," however, i shook them off."
11432,328-129766-0012.flac," i took the diversion of going to the bath, for as i was still far from being old. so my humor, which was always gay, continued so to an extreme, and being now, as it were, a woman of fortune, though i was a woman without a fortune,"
11433,328-129766-0066.flac," and then, reaching his pocket, pulled out a key and begged me to open a little walnut tree box he had upon the table, and bring him such a drawer, which i did. in which drawer there was a great deal of money and gold, i believe near 200 kidneys."
11434,328-129766-0033.flac," tell it was found necessary to do otherwise. she had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house, and in particular the gentleman who, as i said, singled me out for his companion,"
11435,328-129766-0018.flac," but i was in the wrong place for it. i was not now at reddrift, where, if i'd set myself tolerably up, some honest sea-captain rather might have talked with me upon the honorable terms of matrimony. but i was at the bath."
11436,328-129766-0031.flac," and that my brother corresponded chiefly a bristol, i thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to london, where also i had not the least acquaintance. my new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition,"
11437,328-129766-0084.flac," of attending him, night and day, when he was sick, there had not passed the least im modest word or action between us. oh, that it had been so to the last. after some time he gathered strength and grew well peace."
11438,328-129766-0044.flac, i told her i had not given him the least occasion to think i wanted it.
11439,328-129766-0046.flac," and so i put off all room for any offer for the present. however, it was not long before he attacked me again."
11440,328-129766-0089.flac," it was a great while after this that i had occasion on my own business to go to bristol, upon which he hired me a coach, and would go with me, and did so. and now indeed are intimacy increased."
11441,328-129766-0030.flac," so i did not fail to let my new friend know that i expected a supply from thence, and so indeed i did, and as the ships went from bristol to york river, in virginia, and back again, generally in less time from london,"
11442,328-129766-0009.flac," what i brought with me was indeed considerable, had it come safe, and by the help of it, i might have married again tolerably well. but as it was, i was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the hole, and this without any hope of recruit."
11443,328-129766-0035.flac," letting him know that i was still with her, but she denied it, and protested to me that she did not, and he said the same. in a word, this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation."
11444,328-129766-0087.flac," but all along i tested it to be with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own. i told him i was fully satisfied of it. he carried it, that length that he protested to me, that if he was naked in bed with me,"
11445,328-129766-0055.flac," which indeed he did not want. and i clearly saw that i should lose nothing by being backward to ask, so i took her up short."
11446,328-129766-0077.flac," he had left all his money and other things of value with me, and what to do with them i did not know, but i secured them as well as i could, and locked up the lodgings, and went to him. where i found him very ill indeed, however, i persuaded him to be carried,"
11447,328-129766-0001.flac," and to assist and support me as long as i lived. and that if he died before me, he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still, in the name of a sister, and he was in some respects careful of me, when he heard of me."
11448,328-129766-0023.flac," is not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever, and all the men that i had conversed with were of so good reputation that i had not given the least reflection by conversing with them."
11449,328-129766-0075.flac," i was not very easy in that proposal, not knowing what posture i was to live in there, or how he might use me. but while this wasn't a debate,"
11450,328-129766-0071.flac," for i loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes. i told him i must housewife the money he had lent me, or else i should not be able to pay him again. he then told me, in a few words, that as he had a sincere respect for me, he knew my circumstances."
11451,328-129766-0015.flac," as it is called there, and contracted some unhappy acquaintances, which rather prompted the follies i fell afterwards into, and fortified me against them. i lived pleasantly enough, kept good company, that is to say gay fine company,"
11452,328-129766-0074.flac," the company beginning to wear away at the bath, he talked of going away."
11453,328-129766-0080.flac," indeed, if i had been his wife, i could not have done more. i sat up with him so much and so often that at last, indeed, he would not let me sit up any longer, and then i got a pallet bed into his room, and lay in it just at his bed's feet."
11454,328-129766-0081.flac," i was indeed sensibly affected with his condition and with the apprehension of losing such a friend as he was and was like to be to me, and i used to sit and cry by him many hours together."
11455,328-129766-0094.flac," he starts out of his bed, and now, my dear, says he, you shall see how just i will be to you, and that i can keep my word, and away he comes to my bed. i resisted a little, but i must confess i should not have resisted him much."
11456,328-129766-0079.flac," and kept his bed five weeks, all which time i nursed him and tended him myself."
11457,328-129766-0010.flac," i was entirely without friends, nay, even so much as without acquaintance."
