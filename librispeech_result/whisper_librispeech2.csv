43,8468-295198-0032.flac," and admonish him about courses unbefitting his age and standing. as to mother magpie, you may be sure that she assured everyone how sorry she was that dear old dr. bullfrog had made such a fool of himself."
44,8468-295198-0030.flac," he came up into the garden and established himself under a birduck and began to practice italian scales. the result was that poor old dr. belfrog, instead of being considered as a respectable old bore,"
45,8468-295198-0031.flac, got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners. every bird and beast in the forest had a jy bat him. and even old person to it thought it worth his wild to make him a pastoral call.
46,8468-295198-0029.flac," we are the true musical race. and so poor mr. bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cat tails, where his green spectacles and honest round back had excited, even in the minds of the boys, sentiments of respect and compassion."

50,8468-295198-0020.flac," that old bullfrog was a bore, and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish, and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer."
51,8468-295198-0017.flac," laterally, some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age. in fact, since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest, tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits."
52,8468-295198-0012.flac," the fact is, quote, tommy, i'm a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace, and my wife must learn to accommodate. if she has a brilliant husband..."
53,8468-295198-0000.flac," and this was the case with mother magpie. she was always full of everybody's business but her own. up and down, here and there, everywhere but in her own nest, knowing everyone's affairs, telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do."
54,8468-295198-0007.flac," but my husband prefers this style of building. that's only because he isn't properly instructed. prey, did you ever attend dr. kite's lectures on the nervous system? no, i have no time to attend lectures. who would sit on the eggs?"
55,8468-295198-0015.flac," and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses if a metal-sum magpie gets her claw into their nest. but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter. she bustled off down to water doc lane where, as we said in a former narrative,"
56,8468-295198-0018.flac," which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts. they pulled the young checker-berry before it even had time to blossom. rooted up the sassafrashtrubs and nod their roots, fired off guns at the birds, and on several occasions."
57,8468-295198-0013.flac," who success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position, she must pay something for it. i'm sure billy renn's wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home. to say the truth..."
58,8468-295198-0022.flac, madam said dr. bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable. i don't believe it. i can't believe it. you must have made a mistake.
59,8468-295198-0008.flac," oh mrs. magpie, pray don't speak to my husband, he will think i've been complaining. no, no he won't. let me alone. i understand just how to say the thing. i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave offense."
60,8468-295198-0014.flac," my wife was all well enough content, till old mother magpie interfered. it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to."
61,8468-295198-0023.flac," no, no, my good friend. i never make mistakes. what i know, i know certainly."
62,8468-295198-0002.flac," then, having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman, who was always sleepy of a monday morning, mother magpie would take a peep into mrs. oriole's nest, sit chattering on a bow above, and pour forth floods of advice."
63,8468-295198-0006.flac," you are subject to headaches, and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain. ask old dr. kite. i was talking with him about your case only yesterday, and says he, mrs. magpie, i perfectly agree with you."
64,8468-295198-0019.flac," when old doctor bullfrog was leading a concert, had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones. this was not the worst of it. the little violets had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts."
65,8468-295198-0027.flac," dear madam, consider my voice. i never could hit the high notes. how do you know? it's all practice. tommy oriel says so. just try the scales. as to your voice, your manner of living has a great deal to do with it."
66,8468-295198-0011.flac, but then he had a weakness for concerts in general society because he was held to be by all odds the hansmiss bird in the woods and sung like an angel. and so the truth was he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom tittmouse or billy ren.
67,8468-295198-0001.flac," and ready to cast her advice, gratis, at every bird and beast of the woods. now she bustled up to the parsinage at the top of the oak tree, to tell old parsin to it what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon, and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming."
68,8468-295198-0021.flac," poor old doctor bullfrog knew nothing of this, however, and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him one morning. well, neighbor, how unreasonable people are. who would have thought?"
69,8468-295198-0009.flac," i say, my dear, if you'll persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie. my dear, i don't gossip. she comes and boars me to death with talking and then goes off in mistakes what she has been saying for what i said."
70,8468-295198-0003.flac," depend upon it, my dear, mother magpie would say, that this way of building your nest, swinging like an old empty stocking from a bow, isn't it all the thing? i never built one so in my life and i never have headaches."
71,8468-295198-0010.flac," but you must cut her. i try to, all i can, but she won't be cut. it's enough to make a bird swear,"" said tommy oriel. tommy oriel, to say the truth, had his good heart as ever beat under bird's feathers."
72,8468-295198-0016.flac," live the old music teacher, dr. bullfrog. the poor old doctor was a simple-minded, good, amiable creature who had played the double bass and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when."
73,8468-295198-0004.flac, now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you. it's all an account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner. but my dear...
74,8468-295198-0025.flac," bless me, we shall all be ruined,"" said mrs. bullfrog, my poor husband. oh, as to that, if you take things in time and listen to my advice,"" said mother magpie. we may yet pull you through. you must alter your style a little."
75,8468-295198-0024.flac," a nancy nibble who are married this very day? i knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts. and i can tell you, you're going to be scandalously and ungratefully treated, dr. bullfrog."
76,8468-286673-0020.flac," and can move quickly if they will. this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise. one beautiful sun-shiny afternoon, when most of the 20 little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond."
77,8468-286673-0040.flac, and by mistake call him the quick slow little turtle.
78,8468-286673-0012.flac," who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him. that makes him miss his share of good things, and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it as somebody else's fault. the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side, looking at him out of their left eyes."
79,8468-286673-0030.flac," this did not really give him pain, yet as he said afterward, it hurts almost as much to think you're going to be hurt, as it does to be hurt. it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go."
80,8468-286673-0036.flac," does my shell look very bad? he cried. i wish i could see it. oh, i'm so glad to get back. i'll never be slow again. never, never. his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his."
81,8468-286673-0006.flac, the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well. the mother turtle stretched her head this way in that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neck skin. she was so eager to see them all.
82,8468-286673-0008.flac," the mother turtle raised one of her four feet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him. she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her. so you are the one, she said."
83,8468-286673-0025.flac," and slid into the water. all her friends following her. the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him. he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water. and all his brothers and sisters followed him, except the slow little turtle."
84,8468-286673-0035.flac," but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also. he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky. when he did open his eyes, his relatives were sitting around looking at him, and he remembered all that had happened before he slept."
85,8468-286673-0039.flac," he is the quickest one in his family. the pond people looked at each other and laughed. that is queer, they said. after this, we will call him the quick little turtle. this made him very happy, and when once in a while somebody forgot."
86,8468-286673-0024.flac," she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck. when she heard a splash and saw two terrible, great two-legged animals waiting into the pond from the shore. boys, she cried. boys! and she sprawled off the end of her log."
87,8468-286673-0004.flac," and not at all too close. then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand, with a rather cross look in his eyes, and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to. quite as though he were out of patience about something. why didn't you turtles wait for me?"
88,8468-286673-0010.flac," yet down in his little turtle heart he thought, now they are going to catch it. he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him. he wanted to see what they would do. so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side."
89,8468-286673-0002.flac," and then sat down until it should stop aching. wait for me, he called out to his brothers and sisters. i'm coming in a minute! the other little turtles waited, but when his toe was comfortable again, and he started toward them, he met a very interesting snail."
90,8468-286673-0019.flac," and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart. that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land, have higher backshells, and move very, very slowly. turtles live more in the water."
91,8468-286673-0028.flac," he was thinking over and over. something has happened, something has happened. and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not. the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass."
92,8468-286673-0003.flac," and talked a while with him. come on, said the biggest little turtle. don't let's wait any longer, he can catch up. so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log. and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together."
93,8468-286673-0023.flac," yes, set a fine old fellow who was floating near her. a row of their mothers. he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well, but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all."
94,8468-286673-0022.flac," she could see their strong little pointed tails too, and their web feet with a stout claw on each toe. she was so proud that she could not help talking about them."
95,8468-286673-0009.flac, i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait. it is too bad.
96,8468-286673-0021.flac, their mother was with some of her friends on another log nearby. she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their rounded up backshells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black.
97,8468-286673-0037.flac," if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters, she said, i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off. you just wait and see,"" said the slow little turtle. and he was as good as his word. after that..."
98,8468-286673-0013.flac," and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes. he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell, his shell sidewalls, and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell."
99,8468-286673-0032.flac, i wish i might help you sometime.
100,8468-286673-0015.flac," and you, she added turning to his brothers and sisters, must be patient with him. we shall not have him with us long."
101,8468-286673-0014.flac," i did hope,"" said the mother turtle, that i might have one family without such a child in it. i cannot help loving even a slow child who was cross. if he is hatched from one of my eggs, yet it makes me sad. very, very sad."
102,8468-286673-0026.flac," then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and wrapped on that side, which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes."
103,8468-286673-0027.flac," next, the other great animal took him and turned him over and wrapped on his shells and stared at him."
104,8468-286673-0016.flac," i remember so well my first slow child, and how he, she began to cry, and since she could not easily get her four feet to her eyes, she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water."
105,8468-286673-0038.flac," he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them. and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit, he said to the turtles who had always lived there."
106,8468-286673-0005.flac," you certainly are, for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago, and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year. i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch."
107,8468-286673-0001.flac," the mother turtle who was sending herself on the bank nearby said to her friends, why, there are my children. did you ever see a finer family? i believe i will go over and speak to them."
108,8468-286673-0029.flac," he lay perfectly still for a long, long time. and when he thought they had forgotten about him, he tried to run away. then they laughed and picked him up again, and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell."
109,8468-286673-0011.flac, the first year i had only a few children. the next year i had more. and so it is gone. every year a few more children than the year before. until now i never know quite how many i do have. but there is always one slow little turtle.
110,8468-286673-0000.flac," the slow, little mud turtle. when the 20 little mud turtles broke their eggshells one hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried, they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops."
111,8468-286673-0018.flac," or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person. he was a very trying little turtle, yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise. it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises."
112,8468-286673-0017.flac," the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said, and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others. nothing happened to him, and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them."
113,8468-286673-0034.flac," and again, he fell fast asleep."
114,8468-286673-0033.flac," i'm here, he cried joyfully, poking first one and then another of them with his head. the biggest little turtle moved without awakening. i tell you i'm not hungry, he murmured."
115,8468-286673-0031.flac," then he was very, very tired, but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight. this was the first time he had ever seen the moon, for except when they are laying eggs, turtles usually sleep at night."
116,8468-286673-0007.flac," why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters?"" she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle, who was trying to make a place for himself on the log. they didn't wait for me, he said. i was coming right along, but they wouldn't wait. i think they are just as meat."
117,445-123860-0020.flac, whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the woods' boldness by the blushing stand. to be so tickled they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips or whom thy fingers walk with gentle gate.
118,445-123860-0015.flac," o thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power dost whole times fickle glass his sickle hour, who has by waning groaned."
119,445-123860-0006.flac," they are but dressings of a former sight. our dates are brief, and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old, and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told."
120,445-123860-0025.flac, but no such roses see eye in her cheeks. and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. i love to hear her speak.
121,445-123860-0024.flac," if snow be white, why then her breasts are done? if hair's be wires, black wires grow in her head. i have seen rose's damished red and white."
122,445-123860-0018.flac," sweet beauty, half-know-name, no holy power, but is profaned if not lived in disgrace."
123,445-123860-0021.flac," murderous, bloody, full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust. enjoyed no sooner but despised and straight. past reason hunted."
124,445-123860-0012.flac," have i not seen dwellers on form and favor lose all and more by paying too much rent, for compound sweet for going simple savor pitiful thrivers, in their gazing-spent? no."
125,445-123860-0002.flac," no, i am that i am, and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own. i may be straight though they themselves be bevel."
126,445-123860-0014.flac, a true soul and most impeached stands leased in thy control.
127,445-123860-0009.flac," it fears not policy that heretic which works on leases of short numbered hours, but all alone stands hugely politic, that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers. to this i witness call."
128,445-123860-0022.flac," and no sooner had, past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad. mad in pursuit and in possession so. had, having, and in quest to have."
129,445-123860-0026.flac," yet, well i know that music has a far more pleasing sound. i grant i never saw god as go. my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground."
130,445-123860-0016.flac," if nature, sovereign mistress over rack, as thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back, she keeps thee to this purpose."
131,445-123860-0000.flac," it is better to be vile than vile esteemed when not to be received reproach of being, and the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed not by our feeling but by others seeing."
132,445-123860-0013.flac," let me be of sequious in thy heart, and take thou my ablation poor but free, which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art but mutual render, only me for thee. hence thou suborned and former,"
133,445-123860-0010.flac," the fools of time, which die for goodness who have lived for crime."
134,445-123860-0017.flac," but now is black beauty's successive heir, and beauty slandered with a bastard shame. for since each hand have put on nature's power, fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face."
135,445-123860-0008.flac," it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls under the blow of thrawled discontent."
136,445-123860-0003.flac," by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown, unless this general evil they maintain. all men are bad, and in their badness reign."
137,445-123860-0005.flac," thy record never can be missed. that poor retention could not so much hold, nor need itali's thy dear love to score. therefore to give them from me was i bold."
138,445-123860-0023.flac, extreme. a listen proof.
139,445-123860-0004.flac," which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date, even to eternity. or, at the least, so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist,"
140,445-123860-0007.flac," thy registers and thee, i both defy, not wondering at the present nor the past. for thy records and what we see, doth lie."
141,445-123860-0001.flac," for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sport of blood? or on my frailties why are frailer spies, which in their wills count bad what i think good?"
142,445-123860-0019.flac," and they mourner seem at such who, not born fair, no beauty-lark, slandering creation with a false esteem. yet so they mourn."
143,445-123860-0011.flac," word ought to me, i bore the canopy with my externe the outward honoring, or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining."
144,445-123857-0029.flac," where art thou mues, that thou forget so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might? spensed thou thy fury on some worthless song?"
145,445-123857-0028.flac, but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker ate him up to death.
146,445-123857-0032.flac," my love's sweet face survey, if time have any wrinkle graven there. if any, be a satire to decay."
147,445-123857-0030.flac," darkening thy power to lend based subjects light. return for getful muse, and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent."
148,445-123857-0007.flac, what air thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be?
149,445-123857-0027.flac," the roses, fearfully unthorns, did stand, one blushing shame, another white despair. a third, nor red, nor white, had stolen of both, and to his robbery had an extra thy breath."
150,445-123857-0023.flac," nor did i wonder at the lilies white, nor praised the deep vermillion in the rose. they were but sweet, but figures of the light drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
151,445-123857-0001.flac," some in their hawks and towns, some in their horse. and every humor hath his adjunct pleasure, wherein it finds a joy above the rest. but these particulars are not my measure."
152,445-123857-0024.flac," yet seemed it winter still, and you away, as with your shadow i with these did play."
153,445-123857-0016.flac, take heed your heart of this large privilege.
154,445-123857-0013.flac," which, like a canker in the fragrant rose, thus spot the beauty of thy budding name."
155,445-123857-0000.flac," some glory in their birth, some in their skill, some in their wealth, some in their body's force, some in their garments, though newfangled ill."
156,445-123857-0002.flac," all these i better in one general best. thy love is better than high birth to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments cost."
157,445-123857-0017.flac, some say thy grace is youth in gentle sport. both grace and faults are loved of more and less.
158,445-123857-0022.flac," yet, nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell of different flowers in order and in you, could make me any summer's storytell, or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew."
159,445-123857-0020.flac," and thou away the very birds are mute. or if they sing, is with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near."
160,445-123857-0014.flac," that tongue that tells the story of idaise, making lascivious comments on thy sport, cannot dispray's, but in a kind of praise. being thy name, blesses an ill report."
161,445-123857-0003.flac," since that my life on thy revolt, deathly."
162,445-123857-0010.flac," they rightly do inherit heaven's graces and husband nature's riches from expense. they are the lords and owners of their faces, others but stewards of their excellence."
163,445-123857-0025.flac," the forward violet thus did i chide. sweet thief, whenst its thou steal thy sweet that smells, if not from my loaves breath."
164,445-123857-0015.flac," oh, what a mansion have those vices got, which for their habitation chose out thee, where beauties veiled of cover every blot, and all things turns to fare that eyes can see."
165,445-123857-0005.flac, by looks with me by heart in other place. for there can live no hatred in thine eye. therefore in that i cannot know thy change.
166,445-123857-0006.flac," in many's looks, the false heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange. but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell."
167,445-123857-0012.flac," outbraves his dignity. for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds, lilies that festers smell far worse than weeds."
168,445-123857-0019.flac, like widowed wombs after their lord's decease. yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans and unfothered fruit. for summer and his pleasures wait on thee.
169,445-123857-0021.flac," from you have i been absent in the spring. when proud pied april dressed in all his trim, hath put a spirit of youth in everything."
170,445-123857-0031.flac," sing to the ear that duff i lays a steam, and gives thy pen both skill and argument."
171,445-123857-0026.flac," the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells, in my love's veins thou hast too grossly died."
172,445-123857-0009.flac, and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stoned.
173,445-123857-0011.flac," the summer's flower is to the summer's sweet, though to itself it only live and die. but if that flower with base infection meet the bassist weed"
174,445-123857-0004.flac, happy to have my love. happy to die.
175,445-123857-0018.flac," what old december's bearness everywhere. and yet this time removed was summers time, the teaming autumn big with rich increase, bearing the wanton burden of the prime,"
176,445-123857-0008.flac," how like eve's apple the thigh beauty grow, if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show."
177,6000-86686-0004.flac," you see it was st. kavinshore enough, the saint himself and disguise and nobody else. oh, never mind, says he. i know more than that."
178,6000-86686-0024.flac," and so the king had his goose as good as new to divert him as long as he lived, and the saint supported him after he came into his property, as i told you, until the day of his death. and that was soon after, for the poor goose that he was catching a trout one friday."
179,6000-86686-0011.flac," says he, as to repair your old goose for nothing. one, you give me if i do the job for you. that's the chat. says st. kevin. i'll give you whatever you ask, so as the king, isn't that fair?"
180,6000-86686-0019.flac," i will, says king o'toole, and you're welcome to it, says he, though it's the last acre i have to give. but you keep your word true, says the saint. as true as the sun, says the king. it's well for you, king o'toole, that you said that word, says he."
181,6000-86686-0002.flac," and thinking of drowned on himself that could get no diversion in life. when all of a sudden, turning around the corner,"
182,6000-86686-0007.flac," is it a tinker you are? says the king. no, says the saint. i'm no tinker by trade, king of tool."
183,6000-86686-0009.flac," with that the king whistled and down came the poor goose, just like a hound, waddling up to the poor cripple her master, and as like him as two peas. the minute the saint clapped his eyes on the goose, i'll do the job for you, as he, king o'toole."
184,6000-86686-0000.flac," well, well, but the darkness of mankind is untaulable. well, sir, you must know as you didn't hear it before that there was a king."
185,6000-86686-0022.flac, that i've been discourseing all this time without knowing it. so see.
186,6000-86686-0001.flac," and it was he that owned the churches in the early days. the king you see was the right sort. he was the real boy and loved sport as he loved his life, and hunting in particular. and from the rising of the sun up he got, and away he went over the mountains after the deer."
187,6000-86686-0008.flac," says he, what would you say, says he, if i made your old goose as good as new? my dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new, you'd think the poor old king's eyes were ready to jump out of his head."
188,6000-86686-0010.flac," by germany, says king o'toole, if you do all say they're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes, oh, by dad, says st. kevin."
189,6000-86686-0003.flac," god save you kindly, king o'toole says the young man. true for you says the king, i am king o'toole. says he, prince and plenty penitentiary of these parts. says he, but how came you to know that? says he, o never mind says st. caven."
190,6000-86686-0013.flac," this is the bargain i'll make with your king o'toole. will you give me all the grounds the goose flies over the first offer after i make hers good as new? i will, says the king. you won't go back on your word. says st. kevin."
191,6000-86686-0014.flac, honor bright says king o'toole holding out his fist. honor bright says st. kevin back again. it's a bargain. come here says he to the poor old goose.
192,6000-86686-0017.flac, looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark and better than ever she was.
193,6000-86686-0021.flac," then, says the king, who are you? i'm saint cabin,"" said the saint, blessing himself. whole queen of heaven, says the king, making the sign of the cross between his eyes and falling down at his knees before the saint. it is the great saint cabin,"" says he."
194,6000-86686-0016.flac," and throwing her up into the air. who says he, just given her a blast to help her? and with that my jewels, she took to her heels, flying like one of the eagles themselves and cutting as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain."
195,6000-86686-0012.flac, says the saint that's the way to do business now
196,6000-86686-0025.flac," but my jewel it was a mistake he made, and instead of a trout it was a thieving horse-eal, and instead of the goose killing a trout for the king's supper, by dad the eel killed the king's goose. and small blame to him."
197,6000-86686-0015.flac, and it's i that'll make you the sporting bird. with that my dear he took up the goose by the two wings.
198,6000-86686-0006.flac, and how is it you make your money so easy?
199,6000-86686-0005.flac," blur an aiders, how came you to know about my goose?"" says the king. oh no matter, i was given to understand it."" says st. kevin. after some more talk, the king says, what are you? i'm an honest man, says st. kevin. well, honest man says the king."
200,6000-86686-0023.flac," and so your saint says the king, i am, says saint kevin. pied chabers, i thought i was only talking to a decent boy, says the king. well, you know the difference now, says the saint. and saint kevin says he the greatest of all the saints."
201,6000-86686-0018.flac," says st. kevin, for making her the like. by chambers says the king, i say nothing be to the art of man bar in the bees. and do you say no more nor that, says st. kevin. and that i beholden to you, says the king."
202,6000-86686-0020.flac," when the king was as good as his word, st. cabin was pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the king. and, says he, king o'toole, your decent ban, for i only came here to try you. you don't know me, says he, because i'm disguised. moshua!"
203,6000-55211-0024.flac," and there's the tray, did you notice? he exalted turning back to the shelf. you don't see that every day. they get separated most generally, you know. these pieces have been in our family for generations. he had mrs. gregory with an accent of pride."
204,6000-55211-0007.flac," and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought best to try to get over to the house. maybe aunt hannah would come too for luncheon, would she? i'm afraid not, return billy with a roofalaf. she's got three shawls on this morning."
205,6000-55211-0004.flac, though i wanted you to see the teapot too.
206,6000-55211-0041.flac," william henshaw frowned angrily. that was the man, but his eyes. the collector's eyes sought the teapot longingly. before either the man or the collector could speak, however, mrs. gregory interposed quick words of remonstrance."
207,6000-55211-0010.flac," nonsense, uncle william. of course you won't turn back."
208,6000-55211-0053.flac," or what to say. but it showed too, as clearly, that he longed to do something or say something. during the brief minute that he hesitated, however, billy sprang forward. mrs. gregory, please, won't you let me by the teapot?"
209,6000-55211-0047.flac," alice gregory turned as if stung, wished to sell. she repeated the words with superb disdain. she was plainly very angry. her blue-gray eyes gleamed with scorn, and her whole face was diffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair."
210,6000-55211-0003.flac," harlow says others will have to know of it, of course. you see, she's just made up her mind to sell it, and asked him to find a customer. i wouldn't trouble you, but he says they're peculiar, the daughter especially, and may need some careful handling. that's why i wanted you."
211,6000-55211-0055.flac," but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy. mrs. gregory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet, and with the choking, dear child, she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own."
212,6000-55211-0012.flac," billy really, i think we should turn back. but billy would not turn back, and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes, she was mrs. gregory, yes she was. and as she uttered the words."
213,6000-55211-0009.flac," but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached, the man looked about him with a troubled frown. i declared billy, i'm not sure, but we'd better turn back, he fredded. i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this. billy shivered a little."
214,6000-55211-0023.flac," with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation, the collector reached for the teapot. his eyes sparkled. billy look what a beauty! and it's a lowest off, too, the real thing, the genuine true soft paste."
215,6000-55211-0019.flac," though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke. the lowest-stuffed? yes, i'm so glad. that is, of course, i must be glad. i'll get it. her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair."
216,6000-55211-0054.flac," and then won't you keep it for me? here? i haven't the hundred dollars with me, but i'll send it right away. you will let me do it, won't you? it was an impulsive speech and a foolish one, of course, from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness."
217,6000-55211-0040.flac," as i started to tell you when i came in, i have two new pupils, and so, turning to the man again, i thank you for your offer, but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present."
218,6000-55211-0042.flac," but alice, my dear, she almost sobbed. you didn't wait to let me tell you."
219,6000-55211-0048.flac, do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life? a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing? alice.
220,6000-55211-0052.flac," you are very kind, mr. hensha, but i do not think we care to sell the lowest off today. both words and manner were obviously a dismissal, and with a puzzled sigh, william hensha picked up his hat. his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do."
221,6000-55211-0056.flac," even while she shook her head in denial. not so, her daughter, alice gregory flushed scarlet. she drew herself proudly erect. thank you, she said with crisp coldness. but distasteful as dorns and patches are to us."
222,6000-55211-0043.flac, he will give us $100. $100? i code the girl faintly.
223,6000-55211-0058.flac," come, billy. we'll bid you good morning, ladies,"" said william henshaw, then decisively. and billy, with a little wistful pat on mrs. gregory's clasp tans, went. down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk."
224,6000-55211-0039.flac," nielsen supplied the man, as she looked at billy and hesitated. a swift red stained alice gregory's face, with barely an acknowledgement of the introductions she turned to her mother. yes, dear, but that won't be necessary now."
225,6000-55211-0027.flac," madam, if you do not wish to sell, he stopped abruptly. his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china. mrs. gregory gave a low cry. but i do, that is, i must."
226,6000-55211-0061.flac," still, i was sorry for the poor little old lady. i wished somehow she could have had that hundred dollars. it was the man who said this, not the collector. so do i, rejoined billy dullfily."
227,6000-55211-0032.flac," the collector's eyes glowed. he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it. then he turned to the tray. after a moment, he spoke. i have only one other in my collection as rare, he said."
228,6000-55211-0038.flac," stammered mrs. gregory, wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation. this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it. or my daughter alice, mr. hensha, she hastened on in embarrassed introduction. and miss."
229,6000-55211-0050.flac," perhaps they think, too, we wish to live in a place like this, that we wish to have rugs that are dard and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes. alice! gast mrs. gregory and his maid horror."
230,6000-55211-0008.flac, i'll tell her though and i'll see you at 11 finished billy as she hung up the receiver. promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william at park street and together they set out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket.
231,6000-55211-0005.flac," that she was one day to be mistress of the strata and all it contained was still anything would comment to her. i'd love to see it and i'll come gladly, but i'm afraid i won't be much help uncle william, she worried. i'll take the risk of that."
232,6000-55211-0022.flac," near it, set a tray-like plate of the same wear and decoration. if you lift it down, please yourself, motioned mrs. gregory. i don't like to, with these, she explained, tapping the crutches at her side."
233,6000-55211-0036.flac," mother, what is it? who are these people? she asked sharply. billy lifted her chin the least bit. she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name. billy was not used to being called these people, and precisely that tone of voice."
234,6000-55211-0060.flac," the girl was the most stubborn, unreasonable, vixenish little pus i ever saw. i didn't want her old loa stopped if she didn't want to sell it, but to practically invite me there then treat me like that, scolded the collector, his face growing red with anger."
235,6000-55211-0033.flac," i paid $100 for that. i shall be glad to give you the same for this, madam. mrs. gregory started visibly. $100! so much as that? she cried almost joyously."
236,6000-55211-0044.flac," billy, watching the little scene with mingle demotions, saw the glance with which the girls swept the bare little room, and she knew that there was not a patch, or darn, or poverty spot in sight, or out of sight, which that glance did not encompass."
237,6000-55211-0013.flac," however, she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion. mrs. gregory was a cripple. her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches."
238,6000-55211-0030.flac," she finished with a wistful whimsicality. billy turned away sharply. there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes. she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against... she did not know what exactly, but she fancied it was against the teapot."
239,6000-55211-0021.flac," what a beauty! mrs. gregory had thrown up in the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair, disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot, creamy intent and exquisitely decorated in a rose design."
240,6000-55211-0035.flac," mother only think i've- she stopped and drew back a little. her startled eyes went from one face to another, then dropped to the lowest-off teapot in the man's hands. her expression changed once. she shut the door quickly and hurried forward."
241,6000-55211-0026.flac," i have been told so, yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association. my mother and my grandmother own that teapot, sir. again her voice broke. william henshaw clear to throat. but..."
242,6000-55211-0000.flac," chapter 16, a girl and a bit of lowest-offed. immediately after breakfast the next morning, billy was summoned to the telephone. oh, good morning, uncle william. she called and answered to the masculine voice that replied to her. hello?"
243,6000-55211-0059.flac," william henshadger a long breath. well, by jov, billy, the next time i take you curio hunting, it won't be to this place. he fumed. wasn't it awful? choked billy? awful."
244,6000-55211-0034.flac," brought. of course, if it's worth that to you, she pauls suddenly. a quick step had sounded in the hall outside. the next moment the door flew open."
245,6000-55211-0001.flac," billy, are you very busy this morning? no indeed not if you want me. well i do my dear, uncle williams' voice was troubled. i want you to go with me if you can to see a mrs. gregory. she's got a teapot i want."
246,6000-55211-0028.flac," then that it will bring in money and we need money. she threw a quick glance toward the hall door, though she did not pause in her remarks. i can't do much at work that pays. i so she nodded toward the machine by the window."
247,6000-55211-0025.flac," you'll find them quite perfect, i think. perfect. i should say they were, cried the man. they are then valuable? mrs. gregory's voice shook. indeed they are, but you must know that."
248,6000-55211-0031.flac," or against uncle william for wanting the teapot, or for not wanting it if he did not buy it. and so you see, i do very much wish to sell."" mrs. gregory said then. perhaps he will tell me what it would be worth to you. she concluded tremendously."
249,6000-55211-0049.flac," i can't help it, storm the girl hotly. i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's. i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all. and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it."
250,6000-55211-0014.flac, both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one. billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay.
251,6000-55211-0006.flac," why, how funny! well, i'll come. at 11 you say, at park street? yes, and thank you, my dear. i tried to get kate to go, too, but she wouldn't. by the way, i'm going to bring you home to luncheon. kate leaves this afternoon, you know."
252,6000-55211-0015.flac," mechanically, she had taken the chair toward which mrs. gregory had motioned her. she had tried not to seem to look about her, but there was not one detail of the bare little room, from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain."
253,6000-55211-0051.flac," with a little outward fling of her two hands, alice gregory stepped back. her face had grown white again. i'd beg your pardon, of course. she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet. i should not have spoken so."
254,6000-55211-0020.flac, there was only despairing sorrow on her face now. the man rose at once.
255,6000-55211-0029.flac," but with only one foot to make it go, you see the other is..."
256,6000-55211-0017.flac," we, or i came from harlow, mrs. gregory, he gave me to understand that you had a teapot that, or with his eyes on the cracked white crockery picture on the table, william hensha came to a helpless pause."
257,6000-55211-0002.flac," it's a genuine, lowest-off, tarlo says. will you go? of course i will. what time? 11. if you can, park street. she's at the west end."
258,6000-55211-0018.flac," a curious expression, or rather, series of expressions crossed mrs. gregory's face. terror, joy, dismay, and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy. relief in the end conquered."
259,6000-55211-0011.flac," she finished just above her breath. mrs. gregory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs, up which william hensha, toiled with increasing weariness and dismay, punctuating each flight with a despairing..."
260,6000-55211-0016.flac," mrs. gregory had seated herself now, and william henshaugh had cleared his throat nervously."
261,6000-55211-0046.flac," and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp. i am very sorry, of course, if my offer has annoyed you,"" he said stiffly. i certainly should not have made it, had i not had mrs. gregory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot."
262,6000-55211-0057.flac," we prefer them infinitely to charity. oh, but please, i didn't mean you didn't understand, faltered billy. for answer, alice gregory walked deliberately to the door and held it open. oh, alice, my dear. pleaded mrs. gregory again feebly."
263,6000-55211-0045.flac," billy was wondering which she herself desired more, that uncle william should buy the lowest staffed, or that he should not. she knew she wished mrs. gregory to have the $100. there was no doubt on that point. then uncle william spoke."
264,831-130746-0042.flac," ""'you are safe,' said mr. hoop driver, sweeping off his cap with an air of bowing courtly. ""'where are we?' ""'safe.' ""'but where?' chichester harbor, he waived his arm seaworth as though it was a goal. ""'do you think they will follow us?'"
265,831-130746-0057.flac, but that night he was in the mood to dare anything. so you found your young lady at last said the off-sler of the red hotel?
266,831-130746-0033.flac, his mind became an enormous appreciation of the physician. the night was a warm white silence saved for the subtle running of their chains.
267,831-130746-0037.flac," white dust, hot underfoot, blinding to the eye, is now a soft grey silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set star-like in its silver here and there. overhead, riding serenely through the spacious blue, is the mother of the silence."
268,831-130746-0012.flac," another gentleman, who? another gentleman in browns, sir, went into the yard, sir, got out the two bicycles, sir, and went off, sir, about twenty minutes ago. becknell stood with his eyes round and his knuckles on his hips."
269,831-130746-0013.flac," but as yet he seemed merely stunned. brown clothes, he said, and fairish? a little like yourself, sir, in the dark. the osler, sir, jim duke."
270,831-130746-0055.flac," almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes. it was, as i have indicated, the hour and season of the full moon."
271,831-130746-0011.flac," he rose with a fine surprise. gone, he said, with a half-bluff. gone, sir, on her bicycle. on her bicycle, why? she went, sir, with another gentleman. this time beckamel was really startled."
272,831-130746-0006.flac," it wasn't that one at all, miss,"" said the osler, i'd swear. well, that's mr. bohwant, said the barmaid. anyhow, their conversation hung comatose in the air, switched up by beckmo."
273,831-130746-0025.flac," and midhurst and hazelmere and guildford and ripley and putney, and follow this dear fool of a hoop-triver of ours and his young lady in gray out upon the moonlit road. how they rode."
274,831-130746-0027.flac," hube driver had cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born. had beckmell arisen in the way with rapiers for a duel, hube driver had fought as one to whom aging court was a reality and drapery of dream."
275,831-130746-0058.flac," white to misunderstanding said hoop driver with splendid readiness. my sister had gone to bogdnor, but i brought her back here. i took a fancy to this place, and the moon lights simply divine. we've had supper thanks, and we're tired, said mr. hoop driver."
276,831-130746-0017.flac," stephen was too surprised to say anything, but… bourbon, sir? go on, said beckmell. damn you! stephen sympathies changed at once. yes, sir, he murmured, fumbling for the door handle, and left the room marvelling."
277,831-130746-0014.flac," then, with infinite fervor, he said, but let us put in blank cartridge, he said, i might have thought."" he flung himself into the armchair. damn her, said beckham hill, for all the world like a common man."
278,831-130746-0050.flac," you would make me your brother, miss beaumont? yes, we could stop there together. she took him in to answer. i'm going to light these lamps, sittroop driver. he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe."
279,831-130746-0018.flac," she had evidently gone off with him, and that little business was over, and he was here stranded and sold."
280,831-130746-0045.flac," he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic. it's an ugly name, he said, but you are right in trusting me. i would. i would do anything for you. this."
281,831-130746-0039.flac, noah was the moon-shining quite so brightly as in mr. hoop driver's skull. at the turnings of the road he made his decision with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard. the right he would say or again.
282,831-130746-0052.flac," who would be hoop driver on a night like this. but the christian name. christian name, my christian name? well, chris. he snapped his lamp and stood up. if you hold my machine, i will light yours,"" he said."
283,831-130746-0003.flac," then, stephen, the waiter, who had shown hoop driver up, came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question, which, that turned 10 minutes into a quarter of an hour, and in the midst of this discussion,"
284,831-130746-0043.flac," we have turned and turned again. it seemed a hoop driver that he heard her sob. she stood dimly there, holding her machine, and he, holding his, could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath."
285,831-130746-0035.flac," and now they face northwards, and the soft cold light past caressingly over her hair and touched her brow in cheek. there is a magic quality in moonshine. it touches all that is sweet and beautiful, and the rest of the night is hidden."
286,831-130746-0028.flac," it was rescue, allopment, glory, and she, by the side of him, he had seen her face in shadow."
287,831-130746-0002.flac, there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions. there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse. that made 10 minutes.
288,831-130746-0046.flac," prams to help and protect me. i was unhappy at home, never mind why. a stepmother, idol, unoccupied, hindered, cramped. that is enough, perhaps. then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire."
289,831-130746-0010.flac," if so, he was in for an explanation, but he had it ready, she was a monomaniac. leave me alone with her, he would say, i know how to calm her."" mrs. beaumont said stephen, well, has gone."
290,831-130746-0054.flac," she said, with a laugh to break the intensity. he opened his mouth and shut it again, and with the sudden winsing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine. she looked down at him."
291,831-130746-0022.flac," i, beckmell, went with an abrupt tap in prompt opening of the door, stephen entered with the bourbon."
292,831-130746-0036.flac," it has created the fairies, whom the sunlight kills, and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it, the voices of the filmy root."
293,831-130746-0023.flac, the moonlight ride. and so the 20 minutes law passed into an infinity.
294,831-130746-0031.flac," they scarcely heated withered they rode at first, being only anxious to get away, turning once westward, when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them, out of the dewy night pale and intricate and high."
295,831-130746-0001.flac," that gave the fugitives five minutes. then pushing breathlessly into the bar, he had to make it clear to the barmaid what the matter was, and the governor, being out, they spent some more precious time wondering, whatever was to be done."
296,831-130746-0000.flac," the ostler, being a fool, rushed violently down the road, vociferating after them. then he returned, panting to the vekuna hotel, and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up, stopped to give them the cream of the adventure."
297,831-130746-0049.flac," what we had best to be doing, you were tired, you know, and we can't wander all night, after the day we've had. that was chichester we were near, she asked, if he meditated with a tremble in his voice."
298,831-130746-0024.flac, the wretched creature has already sufficiently solid our modest but truthful pages. we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vikuna hotel. we leave all bognor as we have left all chinchester.
299,831-130746-0032.flac," at a footfall, at a roughness in the road. she seemed to be too intent upon the scape, to give much thought to him."
300,831-130746-0040.flac," the left, as one who knew. so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea."
301,831-130746-0020.flac," nicker-bockers went frisking across his mind again, and he reverted to his blasphemies. he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit, and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths."
302,831-130746-0029.flac," he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears, but what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the mid-summer moon? the road turned northward, going round through the outskirts of bognor."
303,831-130746-0015.flac," i'll check this in furnal business. they've gone, eh? yes, sir."
304,831-130746-0059.flac," i suppose you won't take anything, jesse. the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jesse like that, but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit. good night, sis, he said, in pleasant dreams."
305,831-130746-0034.flac, he looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankle gracefully ruling the trebles. now the road turned westward and she was a dark gray outline against the shimmer of the moon.
306,831-130746-0030.flac," then, admits develas again, some warm and lamplet, some white and sleeping in the moonlight. then, between hedges, over which they saw broad, one meadows shrouded in a low-lying mist."
307,831-130746-0026.flac," how their hearts beat together and their breath came fast, and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursued. for all that flight, mr. hoop driver was in the world of romance. had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit?"
308,831-130746-0016.flac," making a memorable saying, let him go, who cares, and i wish him luck, and bring me some bourbon as fast as you can. there's a good job."
309,831-130746-0051.flac," grave and intent. how could she ever have thought him common or absurd? but you must tell me your name, brother,"" she said. her...carrington said mr. hoop driver after a momentary pause."
310,831-130746-0041.flac," hello, submistor hoop driver, sadovoko. they dismounted abruptly, stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight. that was tangled in the hedge on either side."
311,831-130746-0009.flac," as, without knocking, stephen entered, beckamel's face suggested a different expectation. big pardonser said stephen with a diplomatic cough. well, said beckamel, wondering suddenly if jesse had kept some of her threats."
312,831-130746-0007.flac," they listened together. his feet stomped, turned, went out of the dining room, down the passage to the bedroom, stopped again. poor chap said the barmaid. she's a wicked woman. shhh, sits stephen."
313,831-130746-0038.flac," she, who has spiritualized the world, alone safe for two attendants steady-shinding stars. and in silence, under her benign influence, under the benediction of her light, rode an hour, two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night."
314,831-130746-0044.flac," are you tired?"" he asked. i will do what has to be done. the two black figures in the broken light were silent for a pace. do you know, she said, i'm not afraid of you. i am sure you are honest to me."
315,831-130746-0060.flac, but this was living indeed. he told himself.
316,831-130746-0019.flac," and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable, after all, that the girl had escaped through her stepmother, in which case the business might be hushed up yet, and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed."
317,831-130746-0008.flac," after a pause, beckamel went back to the dining room, they heard a chair creak under him, interlude of conversational eyebrows. i'm going up, said stephen, to break the melon cally news to him. beckamel looked up from a weak old newspaper."
318,831-130746-0004.flac," making a sudden an austric in silence appeared beckamel in the hull beyond the bar, walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and past out of sight. you can see the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium."
319,831-130746-0021.flac, he banged the arms of the chair with his fists and swore again.
320,831-130746-0048.flac," i am entirely at your service, i will help you with all my power. i have lost an illusion, and found a knight-errant."" she spoke of beckmo as the illusion. mr. hoop driver felt flattered, but he had no adequate answer."
321,831-130746-0053.flac, the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely. she had to speak.
322,831-130746-0056.flac," and it was chiefly by good luck, and the fact that most roads about a town converged there upon, the chit-chester was at last detained. it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed, but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm."
323,831-130746-0005.flac," incredulous eyes stare into one another in the bar, as his paces, muffled by the stare carpet, went up to the landing, turned, reached the passage, and walked into the dining room overhead."
324,831-130746-0047.flac," to be a human being, not a thing in a hutch, and he, i know, said hoop driver, and now here i am. i will do anything, said hoop driver, she thought. you cannot imagine my stepmother. no, i could not describe her."
325,831-130739-0016.flac," it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen, even at the cost of some blushes. and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story."
326,831-130739-0030.flac," of the concussions attended on that person's hasty, frequently causeless and invariably ill-conceived descents. one large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist."
327,831-130739-0018.flac, let us assume something of the scientific spirit that heard almost professional tone of the conscientious realist. let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest where the unemotional...
328,831-130739-0061.flac," hoop driver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it? never oil the steering, it's fatal!"
329,831-130739-0024.flac," fired by these discoveries, an investigator might perhaps have presumed his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders, elbows, and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story."
330,831-130739-0019.flac," and so, to our revelation, on the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man, you would have observed, ladies and gentlemen, a contusion and an abrasion, on the internal aspect of the left ankle, a contusion also."
331,831-130739-0008.flac," hair of a kind of dirty fairness, grayish eyes, and a skimpy immature mustache under his peaked, indeterminate nose. his features were all small, but none ill-shaped. a rosette of pins decorated the lapel of his coat."
332,831-130739-0029.flac," considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner upon the bicycle saddle, and that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent."
333,831-130739-0045.flac," the shop-walker brings up a parallel to the counter. any particular time when you want your holidays, he asks. hoop driver pulls at his skimpy mustache. no? don't want them too late, sir, of course."
334,831-130739-0057.flac," carry one or two lemons with you, don't tear yourself to death the first day, and sit upright. never lose control of the machine, and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity. you mine those things, and nothing very much can't happen to you, hoop driver. you take my word."
335,831-130739-0026.flac, even in literature one must know where to draw the line. now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shotman
336,831-130739-0007.flac," now, if you had noticed anything about him, it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable. he wore the black morning coat, the black tie, and the speckled grey nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft."
337,831-130739-0042.flac," through the chambers of his brain, seeking some nightly quest in honor of that fair lady, the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dress making upstairs."
338,831-130739-0034.flac," rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road, the road to be explicit, from rohampton to putney hill. and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel."
339,831-130739-0043.flac, he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
340,831-130739-0009.flac," we could show you something better of course. no trouble, madam. i assure you. such were the simple counters of his intercourse. so i say..."
341,831-130739-0003.flac," what he might have the pleasure of showing you? under certain circumstances, as for instance, hats, baby linen, gloves, silks, lace, or curtains,"
342,831-130739-0054.flac," i'm getting fairly safe upon it now, he told ms. howe. at other times, hoop driver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice, but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity."
343,831-130739-0037.flac," to seek the wholesome delight of exertion and danger and pain, and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man, to which initial fact, among others, we shall come again in the end."

424,1963-142393-0011.flac," and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to still it, though he may have to put his future in pawn. but what harm could he do by going to snowfield? dina could not be displeased with him for it."

426,1963-142393-0030.flac, i've always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me.
427,1963-142393-0004.flac," but towards the middle of october, the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly, and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion. the weeks were unusually long. dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind."

429,1963-142393-0002.flac," she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while, and i've no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes. she's told me what her mind is, and she's not a woman to say one thing and mean another."
430,1963-142393-0026.flac, so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away. his love for dina was better and more precious to him. for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep saro.
431,1963-142393-0016.flac," this morning brought with him new thoughts through the grey country, thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past. that is a base."
432,1963-142393-0018.flac," adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow, which had been brought so close to him. he could never thank god for another's misery. and if i were capable of that narrow-sighted joy in adam's behalf,"
433,1963-142393-0045.flac," she was much longer coming than he expected. he waited an hour at least, watching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer. at last he saw the little black figure."
434,1963-142393-0046.flac," coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill. slowly, adam thought, but diana was really walking at her usual pace, with a light quiet step."
435,1963-142393-0053.flac, what was in her mind. she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual humanitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice. but the second time she looked round.
436,1963-142393-0041.flac," the little grey desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened by sheltering trees, lay in sight long before he reached it, and as he came near, he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn."
437,1963-142393-0009.flac," and he thought he must write himself. he must ask dina not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful. he sat up late one night to write her a letter, but the next morning he burnt it, afraid of its effect."
438,1963-142393-0017.flac," in selfish, even a blasphemous spirit, which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that is blighted or crushed another, because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves."
439,1963-142393-0050.flac," and adam rose from the stone wall. it happened that just as he walked forward, dina had paused and turned around to look back at the village."
440,1963-142393-0036.flac," he did not expect dynid to be at home at this hour, but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate."
441,1963-142393-0033.flac," october sunshine, then it had in the eager time of early spring, and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions."
442,1963-142393-0032.flac," what adam came inside of the grey town on the hillside, and looked searchingly toward the green valley below. for the first glimpse of this old thatched roof near the ugly red mill. the scene looked less harsh in the soft."
443,1963-142393-0021.flac, which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain. surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible.
444,1963-142393-0008.flac," if she had not felt this, she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort, but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him. as adam's confidence waned, his patience waned with it."
445,1963-142393-0054.flac," what a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed man. she did not start again at the side of him. she said nothing, but moved towards him so that his arm could class per round."
446,1963-142393-0007.flac, would have too strong a grasp upon her.
447,1963-142393-0028.flac, for she's better than i am.
448,1963-142393-0039.flac," so adam got on his horse again and rode to the town, putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the two chatty landlord, from whose friendly questions and reminisces."
449,1963-142393-0006.flac, but that sort of glow dies out. memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us. adam was no longer so confident as he had been. he began to fear that perhaps dynast old life...
450,1963-142393-0055.flac," and they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell. adam was content and said nothing. it was dina who spoke first. adam, she said, it is the divine will."
451,1963-142393-0024.flac, something like this sense of enlarged being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he wrote along in vivid recollection of the past.
452,1963-142393-0003.flac," i'll wait patiently. that was adam's wise resolution, and it throw excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got."
453,1963-142393-0015.flac," the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart. but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time, or rather, we who read it are no longer the same interpreters. and adam."
454,1963-142393-0027.flac," it's like as if it was a new strength to me, he said to himself, to love her and know as she loves me."
455,1963-142393-0020.flac, by wrapping it up in other words. other folks were not created for my sake. that i should think all square when things turn out well for me. but it is not a noble to feel that the fuller life
456,1963-142393-0044.flac," because it was away from all eyes. no house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near. no presents, but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky."
457,1963-142393-0022.flac, by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and a full-gent day. the growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty.
458,1963-142393-0025.flac, the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point toward which that hard journey from snowfield 18 months ago had been leading him. tender and deep as his love for hedy had been.
459,1963-142393-0040.flac, he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out toward salomon's end. with all his haste it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off.
460,1963-142393-0057.flac," to bear and do our heavenly father's will that i had lost before. adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes. then we'll never part any more, dyna, till death parts us, and they kissed each other."
461,1963-142393-0029.flac," as if you could walk more fearless. when you've more trust in another,"
462,1963-142393-0037.flac," he had set his mind on following her and bringing her home. she was gone to sloan's end, a hamlet about three miles off, over the hill, the old woman told him."
463,1963-142393-0051.flac," adam was glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover, he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him. he came within three paces of her and then said, dina."
464,1963-142393-0001.flac, i wish i'd ask her to write to me though he thought. and yet...
465,1963-142393-0052.flac," she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place. dina, adam said again."
466,1963-142393-0019.flac," i should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself. he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment, and said, evil's evil and sorrow, sorrow."
467,1963-142393-0035.flac," as the delicate web like clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him. he seemed to see dynas' gentle face assuring him with its looks alone, of all he longed to know."
468,1963-142393-0005.flac, he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first strut that she offers him to care much about the taste of the second. he treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties.
469,1963-142393-0023.flac, we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or philosopher to his less complete formula.
470,1963-142393-0038.flac, to preach in a cottage there as her hamper was.
471,1963-142393-0042.flac," perhaps that's the last him before they come away, adam thought. i'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village. he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again."
472,1963-142393-0047.flac," now she was beginning to wand along the path up the hill, but adam would not move yet. he would not meet her too soon. he had set his heart on meeting her, and this assured loneliness. and now he began to fear."
473,1963-142393-0014.flac," he had often been to oakburn and baxons that first journey to snowfield. but beyond oakburn, the greystone walls, the broken country, the meager trees, seemed to be telling him a fresh."
474,1963-142393-0013.flac," that he was already on his way to snowfield on horseback this time, for his hours were precious now, and he had borrowed jonathan burgess' good nag for the journey. what king memories went along the road with him."
475,1963-142393-0056.flac," my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you. and this moment, now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love. i have a fullness of strength."
476,1963-142393-0000.flac," adam understood dynas haste to go away, and true hope rather than discouragement from it."
477,1963-142393-0012.flac, she had not forbidden him to go. she must surely expect that he would go before long. by the second sunday in october.
478,1963-142393-0010.flac," it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips, for her presence reconciled him to her will. you perceive how it was. adam was hungering for the sight of diana."
479,1963-142393-0048.flac," lest he should startle her too much. yet, he thought, she's not one to be over startled, she's always so common quiet as if she was prepared for anything. what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill?"
480,1963-142393-0049.flac," perhaps she had found complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any need of his love. on the verge of a decision we all tremble, hope pauses with fluttering wings. but now at last she was very near."
481,1963-147036-0023.flac," noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood. so you were the cyclist, ah, he said. that's right, said milbur. it is an exercise to which i am very partial. what do you want to ask tarling, alert, and watchful?"
482,1963-147036-0001.flac," you, he said again, and walked towards her. he held out his hand, and she gave him the wallet without a word. sit down, he said kindly. he thought she was going to faint. i hope i didn't hurt you. i had the slightest idea."
483,1963-147036-0032.flac," tarling stepped back. he saw the malicious little smile on milbur's face and could have struck him down. miss ryder does not wish me to see what is in this case, he said."
484,1963-147036-0006.flac," i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet, she said listlessly. but i was not on the bicycle. who was it, he asked. she shook her head. may i have that please?"
485,1963-147036-0019.flac," i'm afraid. oh, i'm afraid. he crushed her in his arms, his cheek against hers, his lips tingling with the crest of her hair. but there's nothing to be afraid of. nothing, he said eagerly. if you were as guilty as hell, i would save you."
486,1963-147036-0033.flac," here. it was the girl's voice, surprisingly clear and steady. her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it towards the detective. there is a reason she said in a low voice."
487,1963-147036-0014.flac," her head was still bent, and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible. tell you what, she asked. what you know of this business, he said, don't you realize how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion?"
488,1963-147036-0020.flac," if you were shielding somebody, i would shield them because i love you, ode. no, no she cried and pushed him back. both her little hands pressing against his chest. don't ask me, don't ask me. ask me, tarling swung round."
489,1963-147036-0018.flac," oh, dad, oh, dad, he whispered. don't you realize that i love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness? won't you tell me everything, please? no, no, no, she murmured with a little catch in her voice. please don't ask me."
490,1963-147036-0035.flac, good god he muttered and read on.
491,1963-147036-0005.flac," she looked up at his words. i, on the bicycle, she asked, no, it was not i, not you. she shook her head. i was in the grounds."
492,1963-147036-0021.flac," there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him. milbur, he said between his teeth. milbur smiled the other mockingly. i'm sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene."
493,1963-147036-0027.flac," but it was an uneasy smile. i make no accusation, he said."
494,1963-147036-0004.flac," it struck him at that moment that it was not an offense for o'dette rider to go up to her mother's house on a bicycle, or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers. if there was any crime at all..."
495,1963-147036-0024.flac," i want you to carry out your promise, mr. tarling said, milburses, smoothly. tarling stared at him. my promise, he said, what promise? to protect not only the evil doer."
496,1963-147036-0026.flac, and that you have it in your power to get a safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow. parlin took one step towards him and milbur shrank back. do you accuse miss writer of complicity in this murder he demanded? milbur smiled.
497,1963-147036-0034.flac," milber had gone too far, tarling saw his face lengthened and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes. then, without further hesitation, he opened the paper and read. the first line took away his breath, the confession of odette rider."
498,1963-147036-0012.flac," oh, that calm?"
499,1963-147036-0028.flac," he shrugged his shoulders. you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet, which i was endeavoring to remove to a place of safety. tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it. i shall see the contents of this wallet tomorrow, he said."
500,1963-147036-0010.flac, he had no more idea that he did love her than whiteside would have had. yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips. the effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him.
501,1963-147036-0025.flac," tarling started. do you mean to say, he said, horsley? do you mean to accuse? i accuse nobody said no burr with a wide sweep of his hands. i merely suggest that both miss rider and myself are in very serious trouble."
502,1963-147036-0008.flac," laying his hand on his shoulder, why don't you tell me? tell you what, she asked for that looking up. tell me all there is to be told he said, i could help you. i want to help you. she looked up at him."
503,1963-147036-0022.flac," but the occasion is a desperate one and i cannot afford to stand on ceremony, mr. tarling. tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager. one comprehensive glance, the detective gave him."
504,1963-147036-0029.flac, locks will present very little difficulty.
505,1963-147036-0007.flac," she held out her hand and he hesitated. after all, he had no right or title to this curious purse. he compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it. oh dad he said gently and walked round to her."
506,1963-147036-0031.flac," the catch is snapped open and he threw back the flap. then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girl's quivering face and read the terror in her eyes. no, no she cried, almost beside herself. no, for god's sake, no!"
507,1963-147036-0003.flac," she drew a chair to the table and dropped her face upon her hands, and he stood by, embarrassed, almost terrified by this unexpected development. so you were the visitor on the bicycle, he said at last. i didn't suspect."
508,1963-147036-0017.flac," she got up to her feet and steadily and swayed toward him. in a second he was by her side, his arms about her. she made no resistance, but rather he felt a yielding toward him which he had missed before. her pale face was up turned to his, and he stooped and kissed her."
509,1963-147036-0016.flac," and he dropped her hand and rose. when she looked up she saw that his face was white and set. he walked to the door and unlocked it. i'm not going to ask you anymore, he said quietly. you know best why you came to me tonight."
510,1963-147036-0030.flac," and pulled from his pocket a chain at the end of which dangle to small bunch of keys. here is the key he said, unlock and read tonight. tarling took the key in his hand, inserted it in first one tiny lock, and then in the other."
511,1963-147036-0015.flac," what business do you mean? he hesitated. the murder of thornton line? i know nothing of that. she made no response to that tender arm of his, but sat rigid. something in her attitude chilled him."
512,1963-147036-0011.flac," she did not shrink back, she did not look surprised. she showed no astonishment, whatever."
513,1963-147036-0009.flac," he was tongue tied for a second. because i love you."" he said and his voice shook. it did not seem to him that he was talking. the words came of their own volition. he had no more intention of telling her he loved her. indeed."
514,1963-147036-0000.flac," the confession of odette ryder. he could only gaze in stupified silence. you, he said wonderingly. the girl was pale and her eyes never left his face. she nodded. yes, it is i, she said in a low voice."
515,1963-147036-0013.flac," was the second shock of the evening. it was as though she had known it all along. he was on his knees by her side, and his arm was about her shoulders, even before his brain had willed the act. my girl, my girl, he said gently. won't you please tell me?"
516,1926-147979-0045.flac," oh, we'll make it all right with molly. get your backup, johnny. molly was mrs. gardner's name, of course."
517,1926-147979-0050.flac," tiny sodorball was trim and slender, with lively little feet and pretty ankles. she wore her dress very short. she was quicker in speech, lighter in movement and manner than the other girls. mary dusek was broad and..."
518,1926-147979-0021.flac," that she hid him away from people. all the dainty she brought down from the big house were for the blind child, and she beat and cuffed her other children whenever she found them teasing him, were trying to get his chicken bone away from him. he began to talk early."
519,1926-147979-0039.flac," somebody dance in in there. he jerked his bullet head towards the dining room. i hear little feet. girls, i suspect. incent kirkpatrick mounted the chair and peeped over the trancem."
520,1926-147979-0030.flac," then he began to feel it all over, ran his fingertips along the slippery sides and braced the carved legs, tried to get some conception of its shape and size, of the space it occupied in primeval night."
521,1926-147979-0015.flac," he had the negro head too, almost no head at all. nothing behind the ears, the folds of neck under a closed, clipped wool."
522,1926-147979-0003.flac, at our comfortable hotel. mrs. harling had known dierno for years.
523,1926-147979-0007.flac," she seemed indifferent to her possessions, was not half so solicitous about them as her friends were. she was tall, dark, severe, with something indian-like and the rigid immobility of her face. her manner was cold, and she talked little."
524,1926-147979-0022.flac," and his mommy said he wasn't all wrong. she named him samson because he was blind, but on the plantation he was known as yellow martha's simple child."
525,1926-147979-0002.flac," through january and february, i went to the river with the harlings on clear nights, and we skated up to the big island and made bomb fires on the frozen sand. but by march, the ice was rough and choppy."
526,1926-147979-0023.flac," he was docile and obedient, but when he was six years old he began to run away from home, always taking the same direction. he fought his way through the lilacs along the boxwood hedge."
527,1926-147979-0036.flac," several teachers experimented with him. they found he had absolute pitch and a remarkable memory. as a very young child he could repeat after a fashion, any composition that was played for him, no matter how many wrong notes he struck, he never lost the intention of the passage."
528,1926-147979-0035.flac," leaped forward in the dark, struck his head on the open window and fell screaming and bleeding to the floor. he had what his mother called a fit. the doctor came and gave him opium. when sanson was well again, his young mistress led him back to the piano."
529,1926-147979-0028.flac," he put one foot over the window sill and straddled it. his mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mast if he ever found him meddling. samson had got too near the mast of skinnel once, and had felt his terrible breath on his face."
530,1926-147979-0013.flac," his yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. good evening gentlemen. no ladies here? good evening gentlemen."
531,1926-147979-0044.flac," it's a fact boys, he said confidently."
532,1926-147979-0032.flac, he seemed to know that it must be done with the fingers and not with the fists or the feet. he approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct and coupled himself to it as if he knew it was to piece him out and make a whole creature of him.
533,1926-147979-0005.flac, for mrs. gardener had gone to omaha for a week. johnny had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent-minded. it was mrs. gardener who ran the business and looked after everything. her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travelers.
534,1926-147979-0053.flac," and had heard darno play in new orleans. at last he tapped his way upstairs, after bowing to everybody in dalsal and happy. i walked home with antenia. we were so excited that we dreaded to go to bed."
535,1926-147979-0052.flac," the light of youth. darno played until his manager came and shut the piano. before he left us, he showed us his gold watch which struck the hours, and a topaz ring, given him by some russian noble man who delighted in negro melodies."
536,1926-147979-0034.flac," he was feeling out the pattern that lay already made on the big and little keys. when he paused for a moment, because the sound was wrong and he wanted another, miss nelly spoke softly. he rolled about in a spasmin of terror."
537,1926-147979-0042.flac, she protested. she'd be awful mad if you were to come out here and dance with us. mrs. gardener's an omaha girl.
538,1926-147979-0029.flac," he thought about that, but he pulled in his other foot. through the dark he found his way to the thing, to its mouth. he touched it softly, and it answered softly, kindly. he shivered and stood still."
539,1926-147979-0033.flac," that lay under the bones of his pinched conical little skull, definite as animal desires. the door opened, miss nellie and her music masters stood behind it, but blind samson, who was so sensitive to presences, did not know they were there."
540,1926-147979-0049.flac, anthony seemed frightened at first.
541,1926-147979-0012.flac," who were to play there next week, and that mary anderson was having a great success in a winter's tale in london. the door from the office opened and johnny gardner came in, directing blind or no, he would never consent to be led."
542,1926-147979-0043.flac," and your tony and your mary. have i got you all straight? o'reilly and the others began to pile the chairs on the tables. johnny gardiner ran in from the office. easy boys, easy, he entreated them. you'll wake the cook, and there'll be the devil to pay for me."
543,1926-147979-0051.flac," she looked bold and resourceful and unscrupulous, and she was all of these. they were handsome girls, had the fresh color in their country upbringing, and in their eyes that brilliancy, which is called bynometaphor alas."
544,1926-147979-0006.flac," he was a popular fellow, but no manager. mrs. gardener was admittedly the best dressed woman in black hawk, drove the best horse, and had a smart trap and a little white and gold slay."
545,1926-147979-0011.flac," a drug man, and willie o'reilly, who traveled for a jewelry house in sewed musical instruments. the talk was all about good and bad hotels, actors and actresses, and musical prodejés. i learned that mrs. garner had gone to omaha to hear booths and bear it."
546,1926-147979-0025.flac," and went towards the window. she saw this hideous little pick-in-any dressed in an old piece of sacking, standing in the open space between the hollyhawk rose. his body rocking automatically, his blind face lifted."
547,1926-147979-0031.flac," it was cold and hard, and like nothing else in his black universe. he went back to its mouth, began at one end of the keyboard, and felt his way down into the mellow thunder as far as he could go."
548,1926-147979-0001.flac," but in black hawk, the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pitched, frozen down to the bare stock."
549,1926-147979-0018.flac," while the miladosat rocking himself, his head thrown back, his yellow face lifted, it shriveled eyelids, never fluttering. he was born in the far south, on the darno plantation, where the spirit, if not the fact of slavery persisted."
550,1926-147979-0010.flac," he was a dapper, little irishman, very vain, homely as a monkey, with friends everywhere, and a sweetheart and every port like a sailor. i did not know all the men who were sitting about, but i recognized furniture salesmen from kansas city."
551,1926-147979-0017.flac," now gentlemen, i expect you've all got grand voices. seems like we might have some good old plantation songs tonight. the men gathered around him as he began to play my old kentucky home. they sang one negro melody after another."
552,1926-147979-0038.flac," and he were gloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers. in the middle of a crashing waltz, darno suddenly began to play softly and turning to one of the men who stood behind him whispered."
553,1926-147979-0027.flac, talk a little while and then leave the room. he heard the door close after them. he crept up the front windows and stuck his head in. there was no one there. he could always detect the presence of anyone in a room.
554,1926-147979-0004.flac," the wind from without made waves in the long carpet. a coal stove glowed at either end of the room, and the grand piano in the middle stood open. there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night."
555,1926-147979-0016.flac," when he was sitting or standing still, he swayed back and forth incessantly, like a rocking toy. at the piano, he swayed in time to the music, and when he was not playing, his body kept up this motion, like an empty mill grinding on."
556,1926-147979-0047.flac," over the piano and began to draw the dance music out of it, while the perspiration shown on his short wool and on his uplifted face."
557,1926-147979-0048.flac," whenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath, he would boom out softly. who's that going back on me? one of these city gentlemen i bet. now you girls."
558,1926-147979-0008.flac," guests felt that they were receiving, not conferring, a favor when they stayed at her house. even the smartest traveling men were flattered when mrs. gardner stopped to chat with them for a moment."
559,1926-147979-0020.flac," his mother, a bucsome young negro, went she was a laundrous for the dernos, concluded that her blind baby was not right in his head and she was ashamed of him. she loved him devotedly, but he was so ugly with his sunken eyes and his fidgets."
560,1926-147979-0040.flac," springing down, he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining room. tiny and lena, antonya and mary dusek were waltzing in the middle of the floor. they separated and fled towards the kitchen, giggling. kirkpatrick caught tiny by the elbows."
561,1926-147979-0037.flac," as piano playing, it was perhaps abominable, but as music it was something real, vitalized by a sense of rhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses, that not only filled his dark mind, but worried his body incessantly."
562,1926-147979-0000.flac," winter lies too long in country towns. hang on until it is stale and chubby, old and solid. on the farm, the weather was the great fact, and the mints of fares went on underneath it, as the steams creep under the ice."
563,1926-147979-0014.flac," we're going to have a little music. some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening? it was the soft, amiable negro voice, like those i remembered from early childhood, with the note of dossier subservience in it."
564,1926-147979-0046.flac," and on his watch case, doubtless on his heart, too. he was an affectionate little man, and he thought his wife, a wonderful woman. he knew that without her, he would hardly be more than a clerk in some other man's hotel. add a word from karpak trick."
565,1926-147979-0024.flac," whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin, she whipped him unmercifully and told him what dreadful things old mr. darno would do to him if he ever found him near the big house. but the next time samson had a chance, he ran away again."
566,1926-147979-0041.flac," what's the matter with you, girls? dancing out here by yourselves when there's a room full of loans and men on the other side of the partition. introduce me to your friends, tiny. the girls still laughing. we're trying to escape. tiny looked alarmed."
567,1926-147979-0009.flac," two classes, those who had seen mrs. gardner's diamonds, and those who had not. when i stole into the parlor, anson kirkpatrick, marshall fieldsman."
568,1926-147979-0019.flac," when he was three weeks old, he had an illness which left him totally blind."
569,1926-147979-0026.flac," though it did not occur to her, then he might have more of it than other children. one day, samson was standing thus while miss nelly was playing her lesson to her music master. the windows were open."
570,1926-143879-0006.flac," grave, she found herself, and positively more weighted, as by the experience of the laps of the year she had spent in seeing the world."
571,1926-143879-0009.flac, with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted.
572,1926-143879-0039.flac, and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard. she had not heard of everything that was very plain.
573,1926-143879-0023.flac," but lily knew nothing of these discriminations, and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anticlimax, and impression confirmed by the fact that it is about silence by mr. osmond, for instance."
574,1926-143879-0038.flac, and occasional laps from candor. in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception.
575,1926-143879-0040.flac, having tages to hear. she had once or twice had a positive scare. since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend.
576,1926-143879-0036.flac, a consummation the more desirable.
577,1926-143879-0035.flac, her character had revealed itself.
578,1926-143879-0041.flac," but it stood for a high watermark in the ab and flow of confidence. madame moural had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow, it immediately begins to decline. there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less."
579,1926-143879-0034.flac," isabel found much to interest her in these countries, the madame mural continued to remark that even among the most classic sites."
580,1926-143879-0045.flac," during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame moral, in whose house she had gone to lodge, meant it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day. when the last of april came..."
581,1926-143879-0015.flac," mrs. ludlow sacrificed, as i say, to paris. yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar. and after her husband had joined her, found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations."
582,1926-143879-0042.flac," a stationary affection, in other words, was impossible. it must move one way or the other. however, that might be. the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic, which was more active than it had ever been."
583,1926-143879-0016.flac, mrs. love those mental motions were sufficiently various.
584,1926-143879-0033.flac," but she added that she herself had always been consumed with a desire to visit athens and constantinople. the two ladies, accordingly, embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece, in turkey, in egypt."
585,1926-143879-0022.flac," than that she didn't wish to speak. it was more romantic to say nothing, and drinking deep in secret of romance. she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice than she would have been to close that rare volume forever."
586,1926-143879-0001.flac," our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late springtime, shortly after her return to the plaza chrysanctini."

619,1926-147987-0002.flac, as he had just put a new yellow lock on the front door. cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone.

628,1926-147987-0026.flac, mr. cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off.
629,1926-147987-0028.flac, she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home. cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices. he could have left her in the omaha hotel.

633,1926-147987-0005.flac," maybe gem would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. i'd feel safer knowing you were under my own roof. i guess gem could take care of the silver and old usery notes as well as you could."
634,1926-147987-0004.flac," grandmother was apprehensive at once. i don't think it's right for you to stay there, feeling that way. i suppose it wouldn't be right for you to leave the place alone, either."
635,1926-147987-0024.flac," when he returned, he told her that he would have to stay overnight there."
636,1926-147987-0000.flac," the day after the car was left, antonea came over to see us. grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted. you've got something on your mind, antonea, she said anxiously."

638,1926-147987-0013.flac," her cry of fright awakened me. truly i was a battered object. as she helped me to my room, i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. my lip was cut and stood out like a snout. my nose looked like a big blue plum."
639,1926-147987-0008.flac," i was only half a week, but i decided that he might take the cutter's silver, whoever he was."
640,1926-147987-0010.flac," the man became insane. he stood over me, choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other, hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse. so this is what she's up to when i'm away, isn't? where is she you nasty well?"

643,1926-147987-0020.flac," my own garments have been treated so badly that i never saw them again. grandmother burned them in the cutter's kitchen range. while antenia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it, the front doorbell rang violently."
644,1926-147987-0021.flac," there stood mrs. cutter, locked out, for she had no key to the new lock, her head trembling with rage. i advised her to control herself, or she would have a stroke,"" graham mother said afterwards."
645,1926-147987-0029.flac," but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible. mr. cutter will pay for this, mrs. burton. he will pay. mrs. cutter aboued, nodding her horse-like head and rolling her eyes."
646,1926-147987-0030.flac," certainly, carter liked to have his wife think him a devil. in some way, he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her sterical nature. perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement."
647,1926-147987-0003.flac, or the way he looked at her. i feel as if he's up to some of his tricks again.
648,1926-147987-0022.flac," antonya was frightened, and was going home to stay for a while, she told mrs. cutter. it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened. then mrs. cutter told her story."

671,7780-274562-0085.flac, is a proposition better suited to the groveling apprehension of the herd than to the fervent dreams of the man of genius. the merit suggested is at best negative.
672,7780-274562-0088.flac," rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance, to the virtues which deny or refrain. beyond these, the critical art can bust suggest."
673,7780-274562-0004.flac," what has been deemed the mere shimmer of the perfectionists. in the brief existence of ellison, i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma, that in man's physical and spiritual nature, life's some hidden principle."

754,2518-154825-0005.flac," ever so little, it caused me sharp pain, for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot. they have broke the leg, though it bleeds little, as the viewer said. we have no time to splice it here."
755,2518-154825-0027.flac," in a minute, i knew from elzavir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk. now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path, even free and untrammeled."
756,2518-154825-0004.flac," i cannot stand, i said. there is something gone in my leg, and i feel blood running down into my boot. he knelt and rolled down the leg of my stalking. but though, he only moved my foot."
757,2518-154825-0008.flac, and he jerked his thumb at musqueue.
758,2518-154825-0056.flac," thinking that we were hiding by the sea. five minutes later, elsevere stepped onto the cliff top with me upon his back. we have made something of this throw, he said, and are safe for another hour, though i thought that gideehead had ruined us."
759,2518-154825-0041.flac," felt a sickening qualm in swimming of the brain, and knew that i was giddy and must fall. then i called out to elzavir, and he, guessing what had come over me, christ had turned upon my side and pressed my belly to the cliff."
760,2518-154825-0022.flac," fah said el zavir, to his poor beast has lost his foothold. it was an ill omen enough, and i said as much, besieging him to make his own way at the zigzag."

762,2518-154825-0034.flac," but spent much time that was so precious in traveling those ten yards to take me around the first elbow of the path. for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag, though i tried to mask it from el zavir. and he..."
763,2518-154825-0055.flac, and i could open my eyes with how to trace of giddiness. so i began to move forward again on hands and knees. and elzavir.
764,2518-154825-0036.flac," but here was another difficulty. for the path was still so narrow, and the cliff was so close that he could not take me up in his arms. so i lay flat on my face, and he stepped over me, setting his foot between my shoulders to do it."
765,2518-154825-0010.flac, and they will take the alive. and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail. i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a violent.
766,2518-154825-0046.flac," like sitting ye emotes against the cliff face. so he talked to himself, and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther. yet could not, for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me."
767,2518-154825-0015.flac," i never heard but one had climbed it, and that was landr jordan when the exercise was on his heels, half a century back. but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot, and a moonded bird like thee may not dare that flight."
768,2518-154825-0033.flac," for there is no room to dance horn pipes here. and hold that eyes fixed on the chalk wall, looking neither down or seaworthed. as well he told me what to do and well i did it."
769,2518-154825-0002.flac," and was only shooting at a venture. we were safe, but for how short a time. safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us."
770,2518-154825-0051.flac," move thou must, and his better-drisk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on. and with that, he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar, moving backwards himself, and setting to drag me after him."
771,2518-154825-0030.flac," and then the path grew steeper and steeper, and elzavir went slower and slower to the last he spoke. john, i am going to stop."
772,2518-154825-0035.flac," forgetting what i suffered cried out. quick and light paste lad, if thou canst, the time is short. now, so frail as man's temper, that though he was doing more than any ever did to save another's life, and was all i had to trust to in the world, yet?"
773,2518-154825-0032.flac," the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee, and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees. but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner, and the balance of thy body to the cliff."
774,2518-154825-0018.flac," tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hail us off to jail. and with that, i tried to stand, thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg."
775,2518-154825-0040.flac," i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror, and the goals reeling about the sheer chalk wall, and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from his very spot perhaps. and in an instant..."
776,2518-154825-0047.flac," thus, i lay with my face to the cliff and else of your pushing firmly in my back. and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of. for had there been a piece of string, or even a thread of cotton?"
777,2518-154825-0050.flac," there is no time to play the woman. another minute of this, and we are lost. plug up like courage, keep that eyes to the cliff, and forward. yet i could not, but answered, i cannot. i cannot."
778,2518-154825-0053.flac," so he gave it up, leaving go hold on me with a groan, and at that moment they rose from the undercliff, below a sound of voices and shouting. they are down already quite else of here, and have found mascuse body."
779,2518-154825-0029.flac," thus, he went on for a time that seemed without end, and yet was really better minute or two. and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive it all on the undercliff, blow fresher and cold on the cliffside."
780,2518-154825-0042.flac," and how he did it in such a narrow straight, i know not, but he turned round. and lying down himself, thrust his hand firmly in my back, pressing me closer to the cliff. yet it was none too soon. or if you had not held me tight."
781,2518-154825-0003.flac," safe with a discharged pistol in our grasp and a shot man lying at our feet. elzavir was the first to speak. can you stand, john? is the bone broken?"
782,2518-154825-0012.flac," there is yet another way that we may try, and if thou hast but two whole legs, i would have tried it, and now it is a little sort of madness. and yet, if thou fearst not, i will still try it."
783,2518-154825-0037.flac, and then while he knelt down upon the path.
784,2518-154825-0026.flac," so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them. with that, he cut me up again, and i shut my eyes firm, rebuking myself for my faint heartedness, and not telling him how much my foot hurt me."
785,2518-154825-0052.flac," now, i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch, fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes. and elzavir, for all he was so strong, could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path."
786,2518-154825-0031.flac," but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down in bid thee. i did as bidden and he lowered me gently, setting me on all fours upon the path, and speaking again."
787,2518-154825-0045.flac," and in five more they will be on the undercliff. and if we ever reach the top, who knows but they have left a guard? no. no, they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag. and if they knew?"
788,2518-154825-0049.flac," i knew that it was moving the little tuffs of bent grass, and the chiting cries of the ghoul seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg, and fling myself off onto the rocks below. even elzavir spoke, john, he said."
789,2518-154825-0028.flac," and not a man in all the world to do it was a full-grown lad in his arms. yet, elzavir made no bones of it, nor spoke a single word. only he went very slow, and i felt him scoffal with his foot."
790,2518-154825-0019.flac," and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off onto the sword. it was a sight to stagger any man, and would have made me swoon perhaps, but that there was no time for we were at the end of the undercliff."
791,2518-154825-0014.flac, where the underclift eyes back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top. the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it. end of men.
792,2518-154825-0000.flac, how fearful and dizzy it is to cast one eye so low. i look no more.
793,2518-154825-0048.flac," i think i could have done it. but there was only the cliff wall, sheer and white against that narrowest way, with never a cranny to put a finger into. the wind was blowing in fresh puffs, and though i did not open my eyes..."
794,2518-154825-0013.flac," just at the end of this flat ledge, farthest from where the bridal path leads down, but not 100 yards from where we stand. there is a sheep track leading up the cliff. it starts."
795,2518-154825-0043.flac," i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness. keep that eye shut, john,"" he said, and count up numbers loud to me, that i may know thou art not turning faint."
796,2518-154825-0025.flac," we'll keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man. but if we fall, why, we shall fall together and outwit their cunning."
797,2518-154825-0021.flac," for the zigzag, started off as a fair enough chalk path, but in a few pieces narrowed down, till it was but a wider thread against the gray white cliff face."
798,2518-154825-0054.flac," it is all up, another minute, and they will see us. but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear, that when i heard those voices from below, i'll fright a falling left me in a moment."
799,2518-154825-0023.flac," and leave me where i was, for that they might have mercy on a boy. tush, he cried. it is thy heart that fails thee, and is too late now to change counsel."
800,2518-154825-0044.flac," so i gave out one, two, three, and while i went on counting, heard him repeating to himself, those words seemed thin and far off. we must have taken ten minutes to get here."
801,2518-154825-0020.flac," and it was a task that might cow the bravest. and when i looked upon the zigzag, it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse, then set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below."
802,2518-154825-0016.flac," yet, if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair, i will carry thee some way, and where there is no room to carry."
803,2518-154825-0011.flac," so only gave a sigh, wishing heartily that musqueue were not dead, and that my leg were not broke, but that i was back again at the why-not, or even hearing one of dr. sherlock sherman's in my aunt's parlor."
804,2518-154826-0001.flac," with the straight sunpath across it, spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back. the relief of being once more in firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken."
805,2518-154826-0003.flac," and i felt a thinking dismoly of the plight we were in. how things had been against us in these last days? first, there was losing the why-not, and that was bad enough. second..."
806,2518-154826-0034.flac," and so i said as much to elsevere, who only laughed, saying the boy was simple and harmless. but from where i sat, i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen. and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough."
807,2518-154826-0009.flac," that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out. at first, elsevere walked briskly, but as the day were on, went slower."
808,2518-154826-0044.flac, though it left sometimes a little patch of broken ruffle peering out at the top of the mound. there were many tumbledown walls and low gables left at the cottages of the old quarryman. grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds.
809,2518-154826-0026.flac, but elzavir passed in the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back. what are you doing here son? block asked. scaring rooks for a farmer top was the answer.
810,2518-154826-0035.flac," but when elves of ir sat down, the boy gave a careful look round and seeing no one watching anymore."
811,2518-154826-0041.flac," and i'm told in other parts of england as well. and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel, slanting very steeply down into the earth, like a well turned a skew, till you reach 50, 70, or perhaps 100 feet deep. then..."
812,2518-154826-0020.flac," then i sought something to fix my thoughts, and looking on that side of the wall where the sword was, felt accounting the wallhills that were cast up in numbers there about. and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up 30 little heaps of dry and powdery brown"
813,2518-154826-0018.flac, and now that i was under the leave of the wall.
814,2518-154826-0038.flac," and in the shelter of the walls. we had slept longer than we thought, for the sun was westering fast, and though the rest had refreshed me, my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again."
815,2518-154826-0015.flac," so sit the here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall, and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways. then if thou see ought moving, wake me up."
816,2518-154826-0037.flac," we must have slept three hours or more, for thou art but of sorry watchman john. tis one of the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs, and for thee the posse might have had its both like daylight owls. with that, he took me on his back and made off with the lusty stride."
817,2518-154826-0029.flac," and his voice had something of surprise in it. nay, but my shot are over small."
818,2518-154826-0048.flac," and the sword crept over the edges of the hole, and every crack and crevice in steps in the slide was green with ferns. the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole, and ruddy brown brambles over grudest steps."
819,2518-154826-0042.flac," from the bottom of this shaft, they're spread out in arrow passages or tunnels, mostly 6 feet high, but sometimes only 3 or 4. and in these, the marble is dug. these quarries were made by man's centuries ago, some say by the romans themselves."
820,2518-154826-0040.flac," although i knew little of these quarries, and certainly was an evil plight to take note of anything at that time, yet afterwards i learnt much about them. out of such excavations comes that black, perfect marble which you see in old churches in our country."
821,2518-154826-0045.flac, and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush.
822,2518-154826-0021.flac," that lay at random on the green turf. i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones. then i felt accounting the blades, feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at 30."
823,2518-154826-0047.flac," for if it were not for this holy purpose, the band drive would have power to strangle the man that cuted it. it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elsevere laid me down at last. the light was very low."
824,2518-154826-0012.flac," behind one of these walls, broken down in places, but held together with struggling ivy, and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush. elvesir put me down at length and said, i am beat and can carry the no farther for this present."
825,2518-154826-0014.flac," and if they come, i cannot help it. for weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead. a square of years ago, i would have laughed at such a task, but now it is different."
826,2518-154826-0052.flac," he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders, and screened my dangling leg from getting caught. thus, he came safe without stumbled to the bottom of the pit. when we got there, all was dark, but he stepped off into an era opening on the right hand."
827,2518-154826-0043.flac," which was just putting on the brighter green of spring. this turf was not smooth, but hummicky, for under atlay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago, which the green vestment had covered for the most part."
828,2518-154826-0016.flac," i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound, and he took my skew's silver-butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly."
829,2518-154826-0039.flac," el severe was still walking strongly, in spite of the heavy burden he carried. and in less than half an hour i knew, though i had never been there before, we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point."
830,2518-154826-0050.flac," and before they come to where we lie, we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them. we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps. back first is one ghost down a hatch way."
831,2518-154826-0022.flac, but would go on for millions and millions and millions. and before i had reached ten in soheralka numeration was fast asleep. a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg.
832,2518-154826-0033.flac," these smugglers are roaming loose, and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hillside. come, come. that does not want a piece to guard thee. they will not hurt a boy. he had the guinea between his finger and thumb."
833,2518-154826-0006.flac," and said, we must be gone. they will not be back for some time yet, and when they come, we'll not think to search closely for us hereabouts. but that we cannot risk and must get clear away."
834,2518-154826-0025.flac," we shall have to show ourselves. and while he spoke, there was a rattle of falling stones, where the boy was partly climbing, and partly pulling down the dry wall, and so elsevere stood up. the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off."
835,2518-154826-0008.flac, and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields. i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished. for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish.
836,2518-154826-0046.flac," on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches. down these steps, no feet ever walked now. for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of these shafts."
837,2518-154826-0000.flac," the day was still young, and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel, with a silver-gray film of nightmests not yet lifted in the offing. a hammocky up and down line of cliffs."
838,2518-154826-0027.flac," have you got a charge of powder to spare, sit else of ear, showing his pistol? i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask. maybe you've seen a flask and walked through the furrows. he whispered to me to lie still."
839,2518-154826-0005.flac," there came before my eyes that gray face turned up against the morning sun, and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy. then elsevere sat up, stretching himself like one waking out of a sleep."
840,2518-154826-0031.flac," the smugglers got off clear, but they say the human cry is up already, and that a head price will be fixed of 20 pounds. so if i sell you a fouling piece, maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master. the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion."
841,2518-154826-0028.flac," no time was wasted in words. elzevere had the flask in his pocket, and the boy was biting the crown. what shot have you said elzevere? what? have you dropped your shot flask 2? ask the boy."
842,2518-154826-0036.flac," then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the human cry. but before elzavir was on his feet again, the boy was out of sight over the hillbrow. let us move on, said block, to his butt a little distance now to go, and the heat is passed already."
843,2518-154826-0054.flac, and carry me in a very constrained attitude. only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinderbox and lit a match.
844,2518-154826-0051.flac," and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that deer village and grace again. the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn, but elsevere paid great care to his feet, lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown."
845,2518-154826-0017.flac," with that, he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall. in a minute, i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep. the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west."
846,2518-154826-0023.flac," and though i could see nothing, i knew that a shot had been fired very near us. i was for waking elsevere, but he was already full awake, and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak. then..."
847,2518-154826-0030.flac," but that must pay a shilling for them. my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or a buzzard, or something fit to cook come over. i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling. if thou art beat, be beat for something more said else of your the tempter."
848,2518-154826-0007.flac, this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in perbeck which they call joseph's pit and then there we must go but it will take all the day to get there
849,2518-154826-0010.flac," it was afternoon for the sun was past the meridian, and very hot for the time of year, when the face of the country began to change, and instead of the short sword of the open down, wrangled with tiny white snail shells."
850,2518-154826-0024.flac," he enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen. he dropped down again with a look of relief and said, tisbeta lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss. we will not stir unless he makes this way. a minute later he said, the boy is coming straight for the wall."
851,2518-154826-0053.flac," and walked on as if he knew the way. i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock, high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright, but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down."
852,2518-154826-0011.flac," the ground was brassy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields. it was a bleak, wide-bidden place enough, looking as ift would never pay for turning. and instead of hedges, there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar."
853,2518-154826-0049.flac," there, he said, this is joseph's pit, and here we must lie hid until they foot is sound again. once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hugh and cry."
854,2518-154826-0002.flac," and the wind, which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge, seemed now but the journalist of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea. but this was only for a moment, for the anguish came back and grew a pace."
855,2518-154826-0032.flac," for while he spoke, i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot, though i tried to keep it in the shadow, and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied around my leg. to answer that very reason says el sivira, that i want the firelock."
856,2518-154826-0004.flac," there was the being known by the x-size for smugglers and perhaps for murderers. third and last, there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult. but most of all..."
857,2518-154826-0019.flac," and gets it length into the shelter. moreover, though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzavir, i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the willingness of pain to love me to slumber."
858,2518-154826-0013.flac," though there is not now much farther to go. we have passed per-baked gates, and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance come or pass along the down. and as for the soldiers, they are not like to come this way so soon."
859,4830-25904-0023.flac," he wouldn't touch his dinner, but laid down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her. and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger, till his mate could share it with him."
860,4830-25904-0048.flac," its eyes were lovely, so dark and soft and liquid. but its mouth was not pretty, and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command."
861,4830-25904-0005.flac," so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelicans. i never knew before what handsome birds they were, not graceful, but with such snowy plumage, tinned with pale pink and faint yellow."
862,4830-25904-0003.flac," and i was so glad to meet with anyone from home that i'd have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me. he didn't, however."
863,4830-25904-0045.flac," on their long scarlet legs, striped zebras racing in their paddock. queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches. pretty antelopes chasing one another."
864,4830-25904-0010.flac," i liked this line very much for, though the biggest, he was very gentle and had a noble face. the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are, some creeping noiselessly too and"
865,4830-25904-0006.flac, they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with the great bills.
866,4830-25904-0008.flac," and there found a splendid sight. six lions and lionesses in three or four different cages, sitting or standing in dignified attitudes, and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes."
867,4830-25904-0025.flac," as a contrast to the wild beasts, i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine, large house, all to themselves. here was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows."
868,4830-25904-0027.flac," he was a cross-old party and sat huddled up in the straw, scowling at everyone like an ill-tempered old bachelor. half a dozen little ones teased him capitol by dropping bits of bread."
869,4830-25904-0016.flac," gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles. the lions behaved best, where they only paced up and down with an occasional cry, but the tigers were quite frantic."
870,4830-25904-0047.flac," and came at the keepers' call to kiss him, and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish. it was very like a seal, only much larger and had four fins instead of two."
871,4830-25904-0020.flac, the tiger snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up. in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more.
872,4830-25904-0028.flac, nut shells and straw down on him from above as they climbed about the purchase or swung by their tails. one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail. i'm afraid the gray one bit it off.
873,4830-25904-0029.flac," and kept trying to swing like the others, forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with. he would run up the bear boughs and give a jump, expecting to catch and swing, but the lame tail wouldn't hold him, and down he'd go."
874,4830-25904-0040.flac," and then nodded his rough, grayish body into a great loop, with the fiery eyed head in the middle. he was not one of the largest kind, but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits."
875,4830-25904-0049.flac," the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water were sitting on a block of ice, panting, as if the mile spring day was blazing midsummer."
876,4830-25904-0030.flac," bounce on to the straw. at first he'd sit and stare about him as if much amazes to find himself there. then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently, which seemed to delight the other monkeys."
877,4830-25904-0007.flac," when fed, they gobbled up the fish, never stopping to swallow it until the pouches under their bills were full. then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen."
878,4830-25904-0044.flac," hoping to find something eatable. i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees, flocks of snow white cranes, stalking over the grass."
879,4830-25904-0035.flac," best. when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree, such as i had seen in other cages, for the snakes to wind up and down. where is he i wondered? i hope he hasn't got..."
880,4830-25904-0031.flac," and finally, he'd examine his poor little tale and appear to understand the misfortune which had be fallen him. the funny expression of his face was irresistible, and i enjoyed seeing him very much."
881,4830-25904-0017.flac, for they tumbled one over the other. shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders.
882,4830-25904-0015.flac," this was their dinner, and as they were fed, but once a day they were ravenous. such roars and howls and cries as a rose while the man went slowly down the line."
883,4830-25904-0026.flac, who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers. a mama sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the grey monkey with the blue nose scolded at me.
884,4830-25904-0012.flac," it was a very loud and large purr, but no fireside pussy could have done it better, and everyone laughed at the sound. there were pretty spotted leopards, panthers, and smaller varieties of the same species."
885,4830-25904-0000.flac," being alone in london, yet wishing to celebrate the day, i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoo-logical gardens. in lovely place it was, and i enjoyed myself immensely. for mayday in england is just what it should be."
886,4830-25904-0033.flac," since i had a tame green one who lived under the doorstep and would come out and play with me on sunny days. these snakes i found very interesting, only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out, and it wasn't allowed to poke them."
887,4830-25904-0041.flac, which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive. i was walking toward the camel's pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face. it's the boa i thought.
888,4830-25904-0037.flac," as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me, the branch began to move all at once. and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the bow's glittering eyes."
889,4830-25904-0018.flac," one lady had a fright for the wind blue, the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw, and he clutched it, trying to drag her niver. the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming."
890,4830-25904-0011.flac, some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws. all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head.
891,4830-25904-0043.flac," i walked beside him, examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye. i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket."
892,4830-25904-0019.flac, as if the whole family of wild beasts were after her.
893,4830-25904-0038.flac," and lay so still, i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me. a very villainous looking reptile he was, and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country."
894,4830-25904-0002.flac, for the birds and beasts are so skillfully arranged that it is more like traveling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a managerie. the first thing i saw was a great american bison.
895,4830-25904-0021.flac," one little leopard was better bred than the others, for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet, proper manner, which was an example to the rest. the mayans ate and dignified silence."
896,4830-25904-0042.flac," much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me. he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way, which i certainly had done with all speed. picking myself out of the hedge."
897,4830-25904-0032.flac," and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away. the snake house came next, and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family. i rather like snakes."
898,4830-25904-0001.flac," mild, sunny, flowery, and spring-like. as i walked along the well-kept paths between white and rosy, hawthorn hedges, i kept coming upon new and curious sights."
899,4830-25904-0014.flac," and all to get very much excited about something, sniffing at the openings, thrusting their paws through the bars, and lashing their tails impatiently. i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till..."
900,4830-25904-0046.flac," and in an immense wire-covered aviary, all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as galley as if at home. one of the curiosities was a sea cow who lived in a tank of saltwater."
901,4830-25904-0036.flac," out, i said to myself, thinking of a story i read once of a person in a manashery who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding toward him."
902,4830-25904-0004.flac," and put down his immense head with a sullen snort as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction. i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick, doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost."
903,4830-25904-0034.flac," and blinked at me through the glass, looking quite as dangerous as he was. there were big and little snakes, black, brown and speckled, lively and lazy, pretty and plain ones, but i liked the great boar."
904,4830-25904-0050.flac, he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him. these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw.
905,4830-25904-0022.flac," all but my favorite, who carried his share to his sick mate, and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat. she was too ill, however, and turned away with a plaintive moan, which seemed to grieve him sadly."
906,4830-25904-0013.flac," i sat watching them a long time, longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run, they seemed so unhappy, barred in those small dens. suddenly, the lions began to roar, the tigers to snarl."
907,4830-25904-0009.flac," one lioness was ill and lay on her bed, looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her. evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering."
908,4830-25904-0024.flac," as i took a last look at his fine old face, i named him douglas and walked away, humming to myself the lines of the ballad. douglas douglas, tender and true."
909,4830-25904-0039.flac," where such unpleasant neighbors might pop in upon you unexpectedly. he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size, which seemed immense, as he stretched himself."
910,4830-25898-0037.flac," don't flap and stagger so, let me hold you. taste this mint leaf, have a drop of water. what shall i do?"" as poor mrs. clark sighed and sobbed, her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back."
911,4830-25898-0050.flac, but it was a long way and dust came on before the red farmhouse appeared. now i'm safe. thank you very much. won't you come in and stay all night? my mother will be glad to see you.
912,4830-25898-0011.flac, what a nice time spekel did have to be sure. for the grasshoppers were lively and fat and ant was in an unusually amiable mood. never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it.
913,4830-25898-0001.flac, and no sooner were they out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as galley as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their a special benefit. it was a fine brood.
914,4830-25898-0024.flac," for some time after this mrs. clark kept her three remaining little ones close to her side, watching over them with maternal care till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings. peep and pack were always together."
915,4830-25898-0007.flac," which ended in chanty's utter defeat, for he died from his wounds. downian snowball soon followed. for the two sweet little things would swing on the bird-ock leaves that grew over the brook."
916,4830-25898-0054.flac," to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her, but the bow of a leafless tree. to stiffen weak to fly up, she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shown across the doorstep."
917,4830-25898-0022.flac," came of it and all the chicks laughed. that made strut mad and he resolved to crow even if he killed himself doing it. he gave an angry clock, slapped his wings and tried again. alas, alas!"
918,4830-25898-0016.flac, for every file in the yard tweeted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice.
919,4830-25898-0008.flac," sitting side by side, the plump sisters were placidly swaying up and down over the clear brown water rippling below when sad to relate the stem broke and down went le"
920,4830-25898-0012.flac, like a brave chick said the old bitty as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind. speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused an ant to utter that remark.
921,4830-25898-0035.flac," there, peck stopped suddenly, rolled up her eyes, and began to stagger about as if she was tipsy. mercy on us! what's the matter with the chick? the next time mrs. clark in grade alarm fits, ma'am, answer dr. drake."
922,4830-25898-0029.flac, and having taken the taste of everything she was about to leave when she heard the stablement coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the meal bin and hid herself.
923,4830-25898-0036.flac," who just then waddled by, oh, what can i do screen the distressed hen? nothing, ma'am, it's fatal. and the doctor waddled on to visit dame parklet's son, who was ill of the pip. my child, my child."
924,4830-25898-0000.flac," there never was a prouder mama than madame clark when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks. chant a clear, strut, snowball, speck, peep, peck, downy, and blunt with their names."
925,4830-25898-0032.flac," she strayed into the sheep shed and finding some salt, aida as much as she liked, not knowing that salt is bad for hands. having taken all she wanted, she ran back to the barn"
926,4830-25898-0002.flac," but poor madame clark had bad luck with her chicks, but they were her first, and she didn't know how to manage them. old anne cockled's hop told her that she didn't, and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends."
927,4830-25898-0048.flac," lot saw a little kitten muing pitifully as it sat under the fence. what is the matter dear, asked kind lot?"
928,4830-25898-0053.flac, and colder and colder became poor blots little feet as she waited through the drifts. the fire light was shining out into the gloom.
929,4830-25898-0045.flac," and cockled up, pecked and croaked fiercely, but, top as she was, the old biddy did not escape, and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand."
930,4830-25898-0031.flac, with her poor little claws sticking straight up as if imploning help. peck meanwhile got into mistrival so.
931,4830-25898-0039.flac," and the bereaved parent wore a black string around her leg for a month. blot, the last of that bright band, needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow. this was the reason why her mother never..."
932,4830-25898-0018.flac," till his throat quite ached with the effort. ah, if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn, and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear, i should be perfectly happy,"" said the silly little foul."
933,4830-25898-0020.flac," you'll fall and get hurt,"" said his sister-blot. hold your tongue, you ugly little thing, and don't talk to me. i'm going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen. be quiet down there."
934,4830-25898-0023.flac, for poor strut. he leaned so far forward in a sprantic effort to get a big crawl out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor killing himself instantly.
935,4830-25898-0040.flac," had loved her as much as she did the others, who were all white, gray, or yellow. poor little blot had been much neglected by everyone, but now her lonely mama discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was."
936,4830-25898-0055.flac," and with a shiver put her little head under her wing, trying to forget hunger, weariness, and the bitter cold, and wait patiently for morning. but when morning came, little blot lay frozen stiff under a coverlet of snow."
937,4830-25898-0021.flac," and here if i can't do it as well as daddy. the chick stops scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear struck crow. purchasing himself on the beam, he tried his best."
938,4830-25898-0052.flac," so goodbye dear. an off-chotted blot along the snowy road, hoping to get home before the hen house door was shut. faster and faster fell the snow. darker and darker grew the night."
939,4830-25898-0014.flac, unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away tripping dismaly
940,4830-25898-0003.flac," and cockletop was right, as you will see, when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family. the tragedy began with chanty, who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow."
941,4830-25898-0044.flac," and peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost, clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pulled her off screaming dofully."
942,4830-25898-0027.flac," and can't look after you just now said their mother one day. yes ma'am chirped the chickens, and then as she went rustling into the haymo they began to run about and enjoy themselves with all their might."
943,4830-25898-0025.flac," being very fond of one another. peep was a most inquisitive chicken, poking her head into every nook and corner and never satisfied till she had seen all there was to see. peck was a glutton."
944,4830-25898-0013.flac," the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up, give one loud croakable arm, and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her. little speckle, remembering the advice."
945,4830-25898-0034.flac," where is pete, as mrs. clark?"
946,4830-25898-0030.flac," sam never saw her, but shut down the cover of the bin as he passed, and left poor peep to die. no one knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the"
947,4830-25898-0043.flac," and were seen by their surviving relatives, featherless, pale, and stiff, born away to some unknown place when snowfall returned. blot was waked one night by a great cackling and fluttering in the henhouse."
948,4830-25898-0042.flac," they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farm yard. for turkeys, hens, ducks and geese fell a prey to it."
949,4830-25898-0038.flac," gasping and rolling up her eyes in great anguish, for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt, and there was no help for her. when always over, they buried the dead chicken under a current bush, covered the little grave with chickweed."
950,4830-25898-0009.flac," chickens and all to a watery death. i'm the most unlucky hand ever hatched, grown."
951,4830-25898-0006.flac, chanty thought he could beat mr. bantam easily. he was so small and invited him to fight. mr. b declined. then chanty called him a coward and gave mrs. b a peck.

953,4830-25898-0019.flac, so he tried every day to fly in crow and at last managed to get up. then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him.
954,4830-25898-0015.flac, what shall i do? it was a dreadful blow to mrs. clark. an ant cockle-top didn't show herself for a whole day after that story was known.
955,4830-25898-0017.flac," he was added from morning till night, and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill, small voice make funny attempts to produce horse little crows, as he sat on the wall and stretched his yaluneck."
956,4830-25898-0046.flac," in the morning few remained, and blot felt that she was a fore-learned orphan, a thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours, brooding over her sad lot."
957,4830-25898-0004.flac," before he had a feather to his bit of a tail, chanty began to fight, and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farm yard. having pecked his brothers and sisters, he tried to do the same to his playmates."
958,4830-25898-0049.flac," i live at the red farmhouse over the hill, only i don't know which road to take. i'll show you. come at once. for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for us, said blood. so a way they went."
959,4830-25898-0010.flac, and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with ant-cockeltop grass-hoppering they called it in the great field across the road.

961,4830-25898-0041.flac," for blot was a great comfort to her. never running away were disobeying in any way, but always close to her side, ready to creep under her wing, or bring her a plump bug when the poor bitties appetite failed her."
962,4830-25898-0028.flac," peep found a little hole into the meal room and slipped in full of joy at the site of the bags, boxes and bins. i'll eat all i want and then i'll call peck, she said."

966,2893-139322-0048.flac," you will lose time. they will doubt if it is you, but they will mass about the council house. there you will find their leaders. your strength is there with them. the boss is only a rumor."
967,2893-139322-0049.flac," it sounds true, cidisano. let us have the facts, cid graham."
968,2893-139322-0039.flac, they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again. they became aware of the remote hooding and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices.
969,2893-139322-0031.flac," the policeman who had shouted, glanced at his fellow, and graham saw him shrug his shoulders. he made no further effort to stop the singing. and so, they went through these factories and places of toil, seeing many painful and grim things."
970,2893-139322-0021.flac," for the most part, intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif. these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves. they assumed this on coming to work, but at night..."
971,2893-139322-0016.flac," they penetrated downward, ever downward, towards the working places. presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits."
972,2893-139322-0023.flac," many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chance to be much in fashion. osano apologized to graham for this offensive sight, but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route."
973,2893-139322-0015.flac," had been a diverse multitude, still stirred by the tradition of personal honor and a high morality. now it was differentiating into an indistinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own, even with a dialect of its own."
974,2893-139322-0007.flac," the blue canvas clothing was on man, woman, and child. many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery. endless, raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation."
975,2893-139322-0004.flac, struck graham most vividly. one lank and very high carriage with longitude and no metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention on duly. a abruptly the edge of the archway cut.
976,2893-139322-0001.flac," on their way, the platform crossed the thames twice and passed in the broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north. in both cases, his impression was swift and in both very vivid."
977,2893-139322-0022.flac," in spite of every precaution, the labor policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed. beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby."
978,2893-139322-0027.flac," by a multitude of coughing men, each guiding a little truck. the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow. the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed too and fro against a long stretch of whitewashed wall."
979,2893-139322-0033.flac," the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill-lit subterranean ills of sleeping places, illimitable vistas of pinpoint lights. here was the smell of tanning, and here the reek of a brewery."
980,2893-139322-0050.flac," even now the ruins may be impassable. graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him. they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one, and there asano acosta delabra, the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech. what did he say as graham?"
981,2893-139322-0047.flac," he said, i might have known the hour has come. he thought swiftly, what am i to do? go back to the councilhouse, said asano. why should i not appeal? the people are here."
982,2893-139322-0051.flac, had not someone in the windvane offices learned. he said a girl. a girl? not. he said a girl. he did not know who she was. who came out from the councilhouse crying loud and told the men at work among the ruins.
983,2893-139322-0029.flac," their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro. and as he looked at the scene, some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing. stop that! shouted one of the policemen, but the order was disobeyed."
984,2893-139322-0011.flac," the latter-day laborer, male as well as female, was essentially a machine-minder and feeder, a servant and attendant, or an artist under direction. the women, in comparison with those grand-remembered,"
985,2893-139322-0002.flac," the river was a broad, wrinkled glitter of black sea water overaraged by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness star with receding lights. a string of black barges passed seward, manned by blue-clad men."
986,2893-139322-0018.flac," he came to the warren of the jewelers, and with some difficulty, and by using his signature, obtained admission to these galleries. they were high and dark and rather cold. in the first, a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree."
987,2893-139322-0038.flac," but for the most part, this remnant that worked hopelessly. all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night, calling for the master, and valiantly and noisily, keeping its arms."
988,2893-139322-0000.flac," chapter 21, the underside. from the business quarter, they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufacturers was done."
989,2893-139322-0025.flac," graham made some indignant comments. but, sire, we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple,"" said osano. in your days, people could stand such crudities. they were near the barbaric by 200 years."
990,2893-139322-0009.flac," the voluntary vigors of the business quarter, graham could note the pinched faces, the feeble muscles, and weary eyes of many of the latter-day workers. such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few galley dressed managers and four women."
991,2893-139322-0010.flac, who were directing their labors. the burly laborers of the old victorian times had followed that dre horse and all such living force producers to extinction. the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine.
992,2893-139322-0052.flac," and then another thing was shouted, something that turned in aimless tumult into determinant movements. it came like a wind along the street."
993,2893-139322-0017.flac," the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted. to graham, they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom, and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways."
994,2893-139322-0044.flac," he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking, oh, strog the nave! for a moment, grams did still. for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream."
995,2893-139322-0032.flac," that walk left on graham's mind a maze of memories, fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines, the racing threads of looms, the heavy beat of stamping machinery."
996,2893-139322-0045.flac," he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and down to the roaring tears of platforms and the shouting running people who were just tickulating past."
997,2893-139322-0012.flac," whereas a class distinctly plain and flat-chested. 200 years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion, 200 years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigor from the blue canvas myriads."
998,2893-139322-0006.flac," the lights diminished in number and size. the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached. and in the dusty, biscuit-making place of the potters, among the fell spar mills, in the furnace rooms of the metal workers,"
999,2893-139322-0040.flac," then a woman with a face of mute white terror, and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran. ""'what has happened now,' said graham, puzzled, for he could not understand their thick speech. then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting—"
1000,2893-139322-0035.flac," even as these enemic millions were crushed by its complexity, and everywhere were pale features, lean limbs, disfigurement and degradation. once and again, and again a third time,"
1001,2893-139322-0043.flac," and a swarthy hunchback, ridiculously gay and green and gold, came leaping down the platform towards him, bawling again and again in good english. this is ostrog's doing. ostrog the nave, the master is betrayed."" his voice was horse."
1002,2893-139322-0005.flac," and blotted out the picture. presently they left the way, and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward, and so came to a descending lift again. the appearance of things changed. and the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared."
1003,2893-139322-0014.flac," to the euthanasia and peace. to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls. in the young cities of graham's former life, the newly aggregated laboring mass"
1004,2893-139322-0024.flac," this is what i wanted to see,"" said graham. this is what i wanted to see, trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement. she might have done better with herself than that, said asano."
1005,2893-139322-0041.flac," that men yelled to one another, that women took up screaming, that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this. ostrog has ordered the black police to london. the black police are coming from south africa. the black police, the black police."
1006,2893-139322-0037.flac, when he saw a number of blue-clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labor police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance. and then came a remote disorder.
1007,2893-139322-0042.flac," he hesitated, looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew. but how can they know?"" asked osano. graham heard someone shouting. stop all work. stop all work."
1008,2893-139322-0003.flac," the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly. here too, the distinctive blue of the labor department was in abundance. the smoothness of the double tracks."
1009,2893-139322-0034.flac," and here, unprecedented reeks, everywhere were pillars and cross-archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen. thick titans of greasy, shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world."
1010,2893-139322-0036.flac," graham heard the song of the revolt during his long, unpleasant research in these places. and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done. graham was ascending towards the ways again."
1011,2893-139322-0019.flac," each man had a little bench by himself, and with a little shaded light. the long vista of light patches, with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils, and the intent face, like the face of a ghost in each shadow,"
1012,2893-139322-0008.flac," but wherever there was work, it was being done by slow-moving workers in blue canvas. the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the workplaces and the orange clad labor police. and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls."
1013,2893-139322-0030.flac," and first one, and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain, singing it defiantly, the song of the revolt. the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song. tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp."
1014,2893-139322-0020.flac, had the oddest effect. the work was beautifully executed.
1015,2893-139322-0046.flac, the masters betrayed! they cried. the masters betrayed! suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent.
1016,2893-139322-0026.flac," and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault. looking over the parapet, graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen. three barges, smothered in flowery dust, were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered feldsbar."
1017,2893-139322-0028.flac," every now and then one would stop to cough. a shadowy, huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky."
1018,2893-139322-0013.flac," to be brilliant physically or mentally, to be in any way attractive or exceptional, had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge, a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendors and delights, and at last..."
1019,2893-139310-0001.flac," a tall man and a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half-open door and to the hall. this man was shouting close to his ear, and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous upperor from the great theater."
1020,2893-139310-0045.flac," a tall, saloed dark-haired, shining-eyed youth, white clad from top to toe, clamored up towards the platform, shouting loyally, and sprang down again and receded looking backward. heads, shoulders."
1021,2893-139310-0005.flac," he grasped the arm of this shouting person. tell me, he cried, who am i? who am i? the others came nearer to hear his words."
1022,2893-139310-0016.flac, he's at the windvane offices directing the people are marching in your name shouting the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannized at last even in my name my name master
1023,2893-139310-0052.flac," attendance intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left. before him went the backs of the guards in black, three and three and three. he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway."
1024,2893-139310-0023.flac," on the one hand was the white council, powerful, disciplined, few."
1025,2893-139310-0002.flac," behind the man was a girl in a silvery gray robe, whom graham, even in this confusion, perceived to be beautiful. her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on him. her lips trembled apart."
1026,2893-139310-0027.flac," a waving, incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces, men and women together, waving pale blue garments, extended hands. many were standing, one man in rags of dark brown, a gaunt figure, stood on the seat and waved a black cloth."
1027,2893-139310-0051.flac," the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet. he was aware of a path before him, of a suite, about him, of guards and dignities, and lincoln on his right hand."
1028,2893-139310-0035.flac," he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln. he perceived the girl in gray close to him, her face lit, her gesture onward. for the instant she became to him flushed and eager as she was, an embodiment of the song."
1029,2893-139310-0025.flac," but why these things should be so? he could not understand. the door opened. lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned, and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult. these intruders came towards him."
1030,2893-139310-0018.flac," no one expected you to wake. they were cunning. damn tyrants, but they were taken by surprise. they did not know whether to drug you hypnotize you or kill you. again, the hall dominated everything. ostrog is at the wind vein offices. ready?"
1031,2893-139310-0014.flac, our leader in your name. in my name...
1032,2893-139310-0029.flac, but a moment that was near to panic passed. he tried to make audible inquiries of
1033,2893-139310-0019.flac," even now there's a rumor of fighting beginning. the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him. oh, strog has it planned. trust him. we have our organizations ready. we shall seize the flying stages."
1034,2893-139310-0015.flac," why is he not here? he has deputed us. i am his brother, his half brother lincoln. he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him. that is why he has sent..."
1035,2893-139310-0021.flac, mast in the... inaudible. it is now or never the council is rocking. they cannot trust even their drilled men. hear the people calling to you. graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds.
1036,2893-139310-0053.flac," with the torrent dipping to flo beneth and shouting up at him. he did not know whether he went, he did not want to know. he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall."
1037,2893-139310-0038.flac," the whole multitude was swaying in congested masses. individual figures sprang out of the tumult, impressed him momentarily and lost definition again. close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by three men."
1038,2893-139310-0047.flac," most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly white, and disease was there, and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean. men and women of the new age, strange and incredible meeting, as the broad stream passed before him to the right."
1039,2893-139310-0000.flac," the people march. he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention, looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment. he took the dose forth with and in a moment he was glowing."
1040,2893-139310-0008.flac," it is london. yes, said the younger man. and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas, how does it concern me?"
1041,2893-139310-0034.flac," wave your arm to them, said lincoln. wave your arm to them. this, said a voice on the other side. he must have this. arms were about his neck, detaining him in the doorway, and a black, subtly folded mantle, hung from his shoulders."
1042,2893-139310-0033.flac," the strength of that chant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him. the hall opened to him."
1043,2893-139310-0044.flac," a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right. he perceived a blue-clad negro, a strivelled woman in yellow, then a group of tall, fair-haired, white-faced blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him. he noted to chinaman."
1044,2893-139310-0028.flac," he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes. what did these people expect from him? he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character, was in some way beating, marching. his own mind, too, changed."
1045,2893-139310-0042.flac," march. his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words. he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward, they were no longer marking time. they were marching. trump, trump, trump, trump in that host"
1046,2893-139310-0024.flac," monstrous crowds, packed masses of indistinguishable people clamoring his name, hailing him master. the other side had imprisoned him, debated his death. these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him."
1047,2893-139310-0032.flac," full of flaunting banners, full of the march and pageantry of opening war, and the feet of the people were beating time. trump! trump! he was urged towards the door. he obeyed mechanically."
1048,2893-139310-0046.flac," hands, clutching weapons, all were swinging with those marching cadences. faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, eyes met his and passed and vanished. even gesticulated to him, shouted and audible personal things."
1049,2893-139310-0012.flac," the people in the little room could not hear each other shout. graham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard. the council, he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a name that had struck him."
1050,2893-139310-0031.flac," the voices were gathered together and up-born by a torrent of instrumental music, music like the music of an organ."
1051,2893-139310-0003.flac," a partially open door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering, clapping, and shouting that died away and began again, and rose to a thunderous pitch."
1052,2893-139310-0039.flac," her hair crossed her face and brandishing a green staff. next, this group, an old care-worn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind, shouted a hairless face, a great cavity of toothless mouth, a voice called."
1053,2893-139310-0037.flac," the hall was a vast and intricate space, galleries, balconies, broad spaces of amphitheatial steps, and great archways. far away, high up, seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity."
1054,2893-139310-0010.flac," ""'because you are the atlas, sire,' said the man in yellow. the world is on your shoulders. they rule it in your name.' the sounds from the hall had died into a silence."
1055,2893-139310-0004.flac," and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room. he watched the lips of the man in black, and gathered that he was making some explanation. he stared stupidly for some moments at these things, and then stood up abruptly."
1056,2893-139310-0006.flac," his eyes searched their faces. they have told him nothing cried the girl. tell me, tell me, cried graham. you are the master of the earth. you are owner of the world."
1057,2893-139310-0043.flac," were bearded men, old men, youths, fluttering robed, bare armed women, girls, men and women of the new age, rich robes, gray rags fluttered together in the world of their movement amidst the dominant"
1058,2893-139310-0011.flac," threaded by one monotonous voice. now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came a deafening tumult, a roaring and thundering, cheer, crowded on cheer, voices, horse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted,"
1059,2893-139310-0017.flac, the young man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder.
1060,2893-139310-0049.flac," mingled in the ranks, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. the whole world seemed marching, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. his brain was tramping. the garments waved onward. the faces poured by more abundantly, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp."
1061,2893-139310-0036.flac," he emerged in the alcove again, and, contentedly, the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting. guided by lincoln's hand, he marched ablyically across the center of the stage facing the people."
1062,2893-139310-0020.flac," even now he may be doing that. then this public theater, bald the man in yellow, it's only a contingent. we have five myriads of drilled men. we have arms, cried lincoln. we have plans, a leader."
1063,2893-139310-0013.flac," but who is ostrug, he said?"
1064,2893-139310-0040.flac," ostrog. all his impressions were vague, saved the massive emotion of that trampling song. the multitude were beating time with their feet, marking time. jam, jam, jam, jam. the great weapons waved."
1065,2893-139310-0048.flac," tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people. tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. the unison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages, men and women."
1066,2893-139310-0022.flac," now dark and hopeless, now clear and ghastly. he was master of the earth. he was a man sodden with thong snow. of all his fluctuating impressions, the dominant ones presented an antagonism."
1067,2893-139310-0007.flac," he did not believe he heard a right. he resisted the persuasion. he pretended not to understand, not to hear. he lifted his voice again. i've been awake three days, a prisoner, three days."
1068,2893-139310-0041.flac," flashed and slanted. then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him, passing towards a great archway, shouting, to the council, tram, tram, tram, tram. he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled."
1069,2893-139310-0009.flac, councillors under the atlas. why should they try to drug me? to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference.
1070,2893-139310-0030.flac," lincoln was shouting in his ear, but graham was deafened to that. all the others saved the woman just articulated towards the hall. he perceived what had happened to the opera. the whole mass of people was chanting together. it was not simply a song."
1071,2893-139310-0050.flac," at lincoln's pressure, he turned toward the archway, walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it. the multitude, the gesture and song all moved in that direction."
1072,2893-139310-0026.flac," and lincoln, gesticulating. the voices without explained their soundless lips. show us the sleeper, show us the sleeper, was the burden of the upper-row. men were bawling for order, silence!"
1073,78-369-0054.flac," when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags. i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when, after nearly two days journey,"
1074,78-369-0020.flac," that restored and then spirited me. the fair was indeed coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate."
1075,78-369-0061.flac," oh, when will my guiding spirit and conducting me to the demon allow me the rest i so much desire? or must i die? and he yet live. if i do."
1076,78-369-0055.flac," my heart bounded within me. but now, when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before."
1077,78-369-0035.flac, will satisfy my everlasting hatred. my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words.
1078,78-369-0015.flac," i am satisfied, miserable, wretch, you have determined to live, and i am satisfied. i darted towards a spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp."
1079,78-369-0038.flac," the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. i did not weep, but i knelt down."
1080,78-369-0037.flac," oh, how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south, covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness."
1081,78-369-0062.flac," swear to me, walton, that he shall not escape, that you will see him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone? no."
1082,78-369-0059.flac," i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the site. i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct ores, and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship."
1083,78-369-0053.flac," warm tears filled my eyes, which i hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view i had of the demon. but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until..."
1084,78-369-0029.flac, these words were legible in one of these inscriptions. you live and my power is complete. follow me. i seek the everlasting ices of the north.
1085,78-369-0049.flac, i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often rung bitter drops of despondency and grief for my eyes.
1086,78-369-0034.flac," one inscription that he left was in these words, prepare your toil is only begin. wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings."
1087,78-369-0022.flac," i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. my life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy. oh, blessed sleep."
1088,78-369-0025.flac," heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice, and beheld clerville, enjoying health and youth. often, when wearied by a toilsome march, i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come."
1089,78-369-0063.flac," sometimes seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale. at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish."
1090,78-369-0041.flac," and i hope to intercept him before he should reach the beach. with new courage, therefore i pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. i inquired of the inhabitants."
1091,78-369-0023.flac, often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfill my pilgrimage.
1092,78-369-0016.flac," suddenly, the broad disc of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed. i pursued him, and for many months this has been my task."
1093,78-369-0052.flac," what it could be, and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished the sledge, and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within."
1094,78-369-0018.flac," the snow's descended on my head, and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plane. to you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown."
1095,78-369-0030.flac," where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive. you will find near this place if you follow not too tardly, a dead hair."
1096,78-369-0056.flac," as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. the work was soon finished. in a few minutes, it tumult to a sea rolled between me and my enemy."
1097,78-369-0044.flac," he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land. and they conjectured."
1098,78-369-0026.flac, and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. what agonizing fondness did i feel for them?
1099,78-369-0043.flac, through fear of his terrific appearance. he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs.
1100,78-369-0019.flac," would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. sometimes, when nature overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert."
1101,78-369-0027.flac," and persuade myself that they still lived. at such moments, vengeance that burned within me died in my heart, and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the demon. more as a task and joined by heaven."
1102,78-369-0036.flac," and calling on heaven to support me, i continued with unabated fervor to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon."
1103,78-369-0017.flac," scared by this horrid apparition, inform me of his path. sometimes he himself, who feared that if i lost all trace of him, i should despair and die. left some mark to guide me."
1104,78-369-0046.flac," my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling. after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge."
1105,78-369-0039.flac," and with a full heart, thank my guiding spirits for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped, notwithstanding my adversaries' jive to meet and grapple with him."
1106,78-369-0051.flac," gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue died. i viewed the expanse before me with anguish. when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain."
1107,78-369-0048.flac, which threatened by destruction. but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
1108,78-369-0028.flac," as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious, then as the ardent desire of my soul. what his feelings were whom i pursued, i cannot know."
1109,78-369-0032.flac," the peasants were shut up in their huffles, and only a few of the most hearty ventured forth to seize the animals, whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey. the rivers were covered with ice."
1110,78-369-0050.flac," the spare had indeed almost secured her prey, and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery. once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil."
1111,78-369-0058.flac, several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor
1112,78-369-0045.flac," a mits cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure, in which i, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant."
1113,78-369-0031.flac," again do i vow vengeance, again do i devote the miserable fiend to torture and death. never will i give up my search until he or i perish, and then with what ecstasy."
1114,78-369-0047.flac," i departed from land. i cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment."
1115,78-369-0040.flac, some weeks before this period i had procured a sled and dogs and thus traversed the snow's with inconceivable speed.
1116,78-369-0057.flac, and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.
1117,78-369-0024.flac," during the day i was sustained and inspirated by the hope of night. for in sleep i saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country. again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father."
1118,78-369-0060.flac, but your direction was northward. you took me on board when my vigor was exhausted. and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread. for my task is unfulfilled.
1119,78-369-0021.flac," and banish. i followed when i could the courses of the rivers, but the demon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected."
1120,78-369-0033.flac, and no fish could be procured. and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labors.
1121,78-369-0042.flac," concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. a gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage."
1122,78-369-0002.flac," i provided myself with the sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed. and now my wanderings began, which are deceased but with life."
1123,78-369-0003.flac, all the hardships which travelers and deserts and barbarous countries i want to meet. how i have lived i hardly know.
1124,78-369-0008.flac," their murder also lived, and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence. i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips exclaimed, by the sacred earth."
1125,78-369-0007.flac, and affecting even to an uninterested observer. the spirits of the departed seem to flip around.
1126,78-369-0005.flac," uncertain what path i should pursue. as night approached, i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william, elizabeth, and my father reposed. i entered it."
1127,78-369-0011.flac," deep of agony. let him feel the despair that now torments me. i had begun my adoration with solemnity, and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends."
1128,78-369-0014.flac, and then i was reserved for vengeance. the laughter died away when a well-known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear.
1129,78-369-0012.flac, heard and approved my devotion. but the furies possessed me as i concluded and raged choke my utterance.
1130,78-369-0004.flac," and prayed for death. but revenge kept me alive. i dare not die and leave my adversary in being. i am a quitted geneva, my first labor."
1131,78-369-0001.flac," my first resolution was to quit geneva forever. my country, which, when i was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now in my adversity, became hateful."
1132,78-369-0006.flac," and approached the tomb which marked their graves. everything was silent, except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind. the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn."
1133,78-369-0013.flac," it rang on my ears long and heavily. the mountains re-ecoded, and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter."
1134,78-369-0000.flac, chapter 24. my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. i was hurried away by fury.
1135,78-369-0009.flac," on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear, and by the o night, and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the demon."
1136,78-369-0010.flac," which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever. and i call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work."
1137,78-368-0052.flac," i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this. there was a frenzy in my manner, and something i doubt thought of that haughty fierceness, which the martyrs of all they've said to have possessed."
1138,78-368-0002.flac," the clouds swept across its swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves."
1139,78-368-0047.flac," and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his dessert. as i spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes. the magistrate was intimidated. you are mistaken, said he."
1140,78-368-0051.flac," my rage is unspeakable. when i reflect that the murderer, whom i have turned loose upon society still exists, you refuse my just a man. i have but one resource, and i devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction."
1141,78-368-0039.flac," and this purpose quieted my agony, and for an interval reconciled me to life. i now relate my history briefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy."
1142,78-368-0007.flac, great god! why did i not then expire? why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope?
1143,78-368-0036.flac," and told him that i had an accusation to make, that i knew the destroyer of my family, and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer."
1144,78-368-0001.flac, the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west. the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend.
1145,78-368-0035.flac," revenge on his cursed head. nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes. i began to reflect on the best means of securing him, and for this purpose,"
1146,78-368-0021.flac," subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes, and their cause. i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror, the death of william, the execution of justine."
1147,78-368-0005.flac," when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream. it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired. as i heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind. my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fiber was suspended."
1148,78-368-0017.flac," after having landed, they proceeded to search the country. parties going in different directions among the woods and vines. i attempted to accompany them and proceed the short distance from the house."
1149,78-368-0029.flac," and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration. i arrived at geneva, my father and earnest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore."
1150,78-368-0040.flac," and never deviating into invective or exclamation. the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as i continued he became more attentive and interested."
1151,78-368-0015.flac," but he eluded me, leapt from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake. the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room."
1152,78-368-0012.flac, but the deadly langer and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished. their murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck.
1153,78-368-0006.flac, i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. the state lasted but for an instant.
1154,78-368-0018.flac," a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened. my eyes wandered around the room."
1155,78-368-0000.flac," chapter 23 it was eight o'clock when we landed. we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn."
1156,78-368-0013.flac, and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described.
1157,78-368-0041.flac," when i had concluded my narration, i said, this is the being whom i accuse, and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power."
1158,78-368-0025.flac," however, it was hardly morning, and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night."
1159,78-368-0044.flac," who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, an inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?"
1160,78-368-0008.flac," she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. everywhere i turn i see the same figure, her bloodless arms and relaxed form."
1161,78-368-0010.flac," but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. i escaped from them."
1162,78-368-0024.flac," there were no horses to be procured. and i must return by the lake, but the wind was unfavorable and the rain fell in torrents."
1163,78-368-0004.flac," and not shrink from the conflict until my own life, or that of my adversary was extinguished. elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence."
1164,78-368-0034.flac, and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great
1165,78-368-0053.flac," how ignorant are thou in thy pride of wisdom, cease?"
1166,78-368-0016.flac," nets were cast but in vain. after passing several hours, we returned hopeless."
1167,78-368-0009.flac, flung by the murderer on its bridle brie. could i behold this and live a last life as obstinate and cling's closest where it is most hated?
1168,78-368-0048.flac," i will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment, proportionate to his crimes. but i fear from what you have..."
1169,78-368-0026.flac," but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness. no creature had ever been so miserable as i was, so frightful an event is single in the history of man."
1170,78-368-0028.flac, know that one by one my friends were snatched away. i was left desolate. my own strength is exhausted.
1171,78-368-0031.flac," sometimes, indeed, i dreamt that i would."
1172,78-368-0030.flac, misery on his gray hairs doomed him to waste in wretchedness. he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him. the springs of existence suddenly gave way.
1173,78-368-0019.flac," as if to seek something that i had lost. after an interval i rose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay, there were women weeping around. i hung over it."
1174,78-368-0043.flac," i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance."
1175,78-368-0050.flac, but all that i can say will be of little avail. my revenge is of no moment to you. yet while i allow it to be a vice.
1176,78-368-0037.flac," however wonderful, forces conviction. the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and i have no motive for falsehood."
1177,78-368-0033.flac," the monster whom i had created, the miserable demon, whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him."
1178,78-368-0045.flac," since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit. i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit."
1179,78-368-0011.flac," to the room where i lay the body of elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her."
1180,78-368-0020.flac, and join my sad tears to theirs. all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind.
1181,78-368-0042.flac, from the execution of those functions on this occasion.
1182,78-368-0032.flac," melon collie followed, but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then released for my prison. for they had called me mad, and during many months as i understood, the solitary cell had been my habitation."
1183,78-368-0027.flac," but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? mine has been a tale of horrors. i have reached their acne, and what i must now relate."
1184,78-368-0049.flac," have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable, and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment. that cannot be."
1185,78-368-0022.flac," the murder of clarevall, and lastly of my wife. even at that moment, i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the theme."
1186,78-368-0046.flac," and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps, he may be hunted like the shemwa, and destroyed as a beast of prey. but i perceive your thoughts, you do not credit my narrative."
1187,78-368-0038.flac, my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive.
1188,78-368-0023.flac," my father, even now, might be writhing under his grasp, and ernest might be dead at his feet. this idea made me shudder, and recalled me to action."
1189,78-368-0014.flac, i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and unpoored. a grin was on the face of the monster. he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my life.
1190,78-368-0003.flac, that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects.
1191,4853-29413-0027.flac," a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we haven't heard of yet, mr. roy lake. i had been dressing for some time past, longing to see crystal. it is needless to say."
1192,4853-29413-0031.flac," had we any proof to justify us? gludy at once acknowledged that we had no proof. i happened to look at the boat, he said, and i missed the ores. oh, yes, i searched the boat house. no ores, no ores."
1193,4853-29413-0024.flac," how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug? you forget, sir, that i had seen the dog revived by two doses, given with a space of time between them."
1194,4853-29413-0026.flac," i should say no, judging by his looks. he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall. for once in a way he was honestly frightened. i noticed the same thing, sir, when he picked me up off the floor."
1195,4853-29413-0019.flac," it was born in on my mind, sir, and that's all i can tell you, he said. i didn't dare speak to you about it. you wouldn't have believed me. or if you did believe me, you might have sent for the police."
1196,4853-29413-0012.flac," the investigation that followed was far too long and too weary some to be related here. if i give the substance of it, i shall have done enough. sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone, sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming."
1197,4853-29413-0009.flac, what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too. crystal had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause.
1198,4853-29413-0015.flac," but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him, far from being shaken, was confirmed by circumstances. when his master returned to the chemical studies, which have been already mentioned,"
1199,4853-29413-0018.flac," that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen. by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened, by the experiment on the dog, he was entirely unable to explain."
1200,4853-29413-0022.flac, she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me. and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life. what is situation for a girl of 18?
1201,4853-29413-0030.flac," i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door. what i had just heard brought me back into the room. as a matter of course, we both suspected the same person of stealing the ores."
1202,4853-29413-0011.flac," the magistrate would put questions to me, wouldn't he, sir? very good. you put questions to me, and i'll answer them to the best of my ability."
1203,4853-29413-0028.flac," is there anything more i asked that i ought to know? only one thing, mr. roylake, that i can think of, gludy replied, i'm afraid it's miss crystal's turn next. what do you mean?"
1204,4853-29413-0013.flac," the kerr had betrayed himself. it was a paltry vengeance, ione, to gratify a malicious pleasure, as i did now, in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name, which his morbid humility had suggested."
1205,4853-29413-0032.flac," and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me. nothing, sir."
1206,4853-29413-0017.flac," a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed. the last dose was repeated, and the dog soon sprang to his feet again, as lively as ever. gludy was there upon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time."
1207,4853-29413-0016.flac, gludy was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful. he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party.
1208,4853-29413-0021.flac," that she was true as steel and not easily frightened, i didn't need to gas, i knew it. gloudey had done his best to prepare crystal for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded."
1209,4853-29413-0020.flac," the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief, if murdering mischief it might be, was to trust miss crystal. that she was fond of you, i don't mean any offence, sir. i pretty well guessed."
1210,4853-29413-0014.flac," to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the curregarded me. he had done his best to warn me, without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse, and he had failed."
1211,4853-29413-0025.flac," i ought to have remembered this, after what he had already told me. my intelligence brightened a little as i went on. and your accident in the next room was planned, of course, i said."
1212,4853-29413-0010.flac," we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law and force, i said. in the meantime, gludy, i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness."" he considered a little."
1213,4853-29413-0029.flac," while the deaf man lodges at the cottage, he means mischief, and as i is on miss crystal. early this morning, sir, i happen to be at the boat house. somebody, i leave you to guess who it is, has stolen the oars."
1214,4853-29413-0023.flac," whatever she saw him drink, she was to insist on your drinking it too. you heard me ask leave to make the tea? yes. well, that was one of the signals agreed on between us."
1215,4853-29413-0005.flac," i'm dismissed from my master's service. that's all. it was plainly not all. relieved even by that guarded reply, i pointed to a chair by the bedside. do you believe that i mean well by you, i asked?"
1216,4853-29413-0003.flac," the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter. unless i was completely mistaken, here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me. gludy showed himself at the door."
1217,4853-29413-0000.flac," gludy settles the account. a night of fever, a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams. this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened."
1218,4853-29413-0006.flac, what did he do? flew into a furious rage. i don't complain of that. i dare say i deserved it. pleased to excuse my getting up again. i can't look you in the face and tell you of it. he walked away to the window.
1219,4853-29413-0002.flac," the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me. the same man, sir, who was found in the garden looking at your flowers. i, at once, gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom."
1220,4853-29413-0007.flac," even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted, mr. roy lake. he kicked me, saying no more about it, sir. i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you. only i don't know how."
1221,4853-29413-0008.flac," in this difficulty, he came back to my bedside. look here, sir. what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him. yes, i say the account between us two has settled now on both sides."
1222,4853-29413-0004.flac," with the face ominously wretched as well as ugly. i instantly thought of crystal. if you bring me bad news, i said, don't keep me waiting for it. it's nothing that need trouble, you sir."
1223,4853-29413-0001.flac," the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me. the mercy of sleep found me. when i woke and looked at my watch, i was a new man. the hour was noon. i rang my bell."
1224,4853-27670-0025.flac," until, coming a breast of the main hatch, the rays of the lanterns struck upon a man's body, which, on my bringing the flame to his face, proved to be captain rosie. there was a wound over his right brow."
1225,4853-27670-0028.flac," for they lay under a whole body of shrouds, complicated by a mass of other year, against which leaned a portion of the caboose. i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead, and then, with a heart of lead, turned away."
1226,4853-27670-0029.flac, i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seamant named abraham wise near the forehatch.
1227,4853-27670-0022.flac," nevertheless, its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruehm, the deck's offered. the main mask was snapped three or four feet above the deck, and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth."
1228,4853-27670-0005.flac," the brig pitched enrolled heavily. much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her. nevertheless, i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in."
1229,4853-27670-0011.flac," but no feature of my lamentable situation so afraid of me, so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness. oh, for one companion!"
1230,4853-27670-0003.flac," it was intensely dark. the binocle lamp was extinguished, and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest color upon the hatchway. one thing i quickly noticed, that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze."
1231,4853-27670-0001.flac, i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me. my hair was stiff with ice. there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone.
1232,4853-27670-0021.flac," i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me, enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it. am thus equipped, i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log."
1233,4853-27670-0035.flac," i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway, and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her, she was sound, but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing."
1234,4853-27670-0033.flac," nevertheless, her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that, spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state, being as hopeless as the sky was starless."
1235,4853-27670-0016.flac," by preventing the seas, which washed onto the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft, also that the whole length of the main and top masks lay upon the lardboard rail and over the side."
1236,4853-27670-0009.flac," my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation. it was dreadful to be standing, nearly dead with cold, in utter darkness."
1237,4853-27670-0006.flac," it was wonderful, however, that she should still be afloat. no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out."
1238,4853-27670-0031.flac," but the motion of the brig continued very heavy, a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone, and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses."
1239,4853-27670-0002.flac," my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armor, so inflexibly hard were they frozen. yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk, and that life float warm in my veins."
1240,4853-27670-0036.flac," and even had i managed this, she stood to be swamped and i'd be drowned."
1241,4853-27670-0034.flac," to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel. that she was filling i knew well, yet not leaking so rapidly, but that had our crew being preserved, we might easily have kept her free."
1242,4853-27670-0026.flac," and as if that had not suffice to slay him, the fall of the mast had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body, binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly."
1243,4853-27670-0017.flac, my eyes directly saw it and found the time 20 minutes after 10. this signified that i had 10 or 11 hours of darkness before me.
1244,4853-27670-0024.flac," i moved with extreme caution, casting the lantern light before me, sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan, then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull."
1245,4853-27670-0023.flac, but i now notice that the weight of the hamper being on the lardboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bow's fair at the sea.
1246,4853-27670-0010.flac," it was dreadful, i say, to be thus placed, and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest, most desolate space of sea in the world, into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round."
1247,4853-27670-0032.flac," i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull, with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside. wait here enough, you would have supposed to stave the ship."
1248,4853-27670-0008.flac," what has come to pass? is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard? certainly five men at least were living before we followed the ice, and again i cried out. is there anyone alive?"
1249,4853-27670-0012.flac," even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech. nay, god himself, the merciful father of all, even he seemed not. the blackness laid like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul."
1250,4853-27670-0007.flac," finding that i had the use of my voice, i hallowed as loudly as i could, but no human note responded. three or four times i shouted, giving some of the people their names, but in vain. father of mercy i thought."
1251,4853-27670-0004.flac," there was less spied in its wash, less fury in its blow. the multitude in us roaring of the heaving blackness had soared into a heart and sullen growing, a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley."
1252,4853-27670-0014.flac," reasserted itself. and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig. there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas. and that, after all,"
1253,4853-27670-0000.flac," i lay for a long while insensible, and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon, i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvelous."
1254,4853-27670-0019.flac," i swallowed half a panicking of the hollins for the sake of the warmth and life of the draft, and entering my cabin put on thick, dry stockings, first, chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them."
1255,4853-27670-0015.flac," her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg. at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water, creaming upon the surges on either hand,"
1256,4853-27670-0018.flac," i took down the lamp, trimmed it, and went to the lazarus hatch at the after end of the cabin. here, we're kept the stores for the crew."
1257,4853-27670-0027.flac," that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man. under a massive rigging in the lardboard scuppers lay two bodies, as i could just faintly discern."
1258,4853-27670-0020.flac," and i then, with the siemens dispatch, shifted the rest of my apparel, and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change. though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days."
1259,4853-27670-0013.flac," misery and horror were within that shadow, and beyond it nothing that my spirit could look up to. i stood for some moments as one stunned, and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea."
1260,4853-27670-0030.flac, no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead. the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea.
1261,4853-27671-0027.flac, the boat was about 15 feet long.
1262,4853-27671-0013.flac," it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her, and, if this well fell over her bows and filled the decks, down she would go. i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money."
1263,4853-27671-0019.flac, i threw the ore over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig. not so much because i desired to see the last of her.
1264,4853-27671-0037.flac," was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion, the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise."
1265,4853-27671-0031.flac, then by sailing into the great desolation of the northwest. the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering.
1266,4853-27671-0021.flac, and her main deck blew up with a loud clapper blast of noise. i could follow the line of her bowlworks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under.
1267,4853-27671-0035.flac," lifting my eyes within voluntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor, i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies."
1268,4853-27671-0036.flac," it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fouls of its dominions, and poised on tremorless wings."
1269,4853-27671-0004.flac," one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected. the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat. it was thus we carried those boats, the little one lying snugly enough in the other. the sea that had flooded our decks."
1270,4853-27671-0025.flac, and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason. i rose from the seat onto which i had sunk and lose the sail.
1271,4853-27671-0007.flac," and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over. i then, with a hand spike, prized her nose to the gangway, secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers."
1272,4853-27671-0026.flac," and hauling the sheet afed, put the ore over the stern, and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course. the draft of air was extremely weak, and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside."
1273,4853-27671-0038.flac, the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me. its eyes had the sparkling blood-red gleam of rubies.
1274,4853-27671-0024.flac," so that when he jumped to the surface, he came with his hands lifted up to heaven, and thus he stayed a minute, sustained by the eddies which also revolved him. the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great."
1275,4853-27671-0012.flac, the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to make haste. she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming and broad liquid blue brows to her stem.
1276,4853-27671-0015.flac," heaving very slowly, though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold. and, eastwards, the shoulder of the swell, catching the glorious reflection of the sun, hurled the splendor along."
1277,4853-27671-0039.flac," it was as silent as a phantom, and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable. so far from finding any comfort or companionship in the creature."
1278,4853-27671-0014.flac," when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hall gave me a freight. and, watching my chance, i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her a draft. the sun was an hour above the horizon."
1279,4853-27671-0011.flac," 8 or 10 biscuits, some candles, a tinderbox, several lemons, a little bag of flour, and 13 bottles of beer. these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat."
1280,4853-27671-0001.flac, i had at one time during the block hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise.
1281,4853-27671-0022.flac," and which she dragged down with her. on a sudden, when the last fragment of mast had disappeared, and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea, uproze a body with a sort of leap."
1282,4853-27671-0033.flac," and then all was bare, bald, swelling sea, an imperiled sky, darkening in lagoon of azure, down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapor, lying like the coast of a continent on the lardboard horizon."
1283,4853-27671-0010.flac," i ran to the cabin, but the lazarette was full of water, and none of the provisions in it to become at. i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese, a piece of raw pork, half a ham."
1284,4853-27671-0040.flac," it uttered a strange salt cry, the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope, flopped its wings, and after a turn or two."
1285,4853-27671-0029.flac," where perchance i might meet a wailer or a south seaman from new holland, but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard. indeed,"
1286,4853-27671-0009.flac," but i met with an ore that had belonged to the other boat, and this, with the mast and sail, i dropped into her, the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past. my next business was to victory her."
1287,4853-27671-0018.flac," with us had it dawned yesterday instead of today. my companions would have been alive, and yonder sinking ruined fabric, a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last."
1288,4853-27671-0002.flac," and a deep of rolling sapphire, i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water, and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the ballwork rail."
1289,4853-27671-0030.flac," i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up. and that, though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts, i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts."
1290,4853-27671-0017.flac," shot with pearly luster, floated overhead very high. it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an ac coldness indeed, but the air being dry, its truedness was indurable."
1291,4853-27671-0023.flac," it was the sailor that had leaned round on the starboard side of the forward deck. being frozen stuff, he rose in the posture in which he had expired, that is, with his arms extended."
1292,4853-27671-0020.flac," into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky. will the whole floated? she was something to hold on to, so to say, something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon."
1293,4853-27671-0003.flac," yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin. it was visible now to its most trifling detail. the foremask was gone smooth off at the deck, it lay over the starboard bow."
1294,4853-27671-0032.flac," i am persuaded my heart must have broken, and that i should have died of grief. faintly as the wind blew, it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck."
1295,4853-27671-0034.flac," but one living thing there was besides myself, a grey-brusted albatross of a princely width opinion. i had not observed it till the hole went down, and then..."
1296,4853-27671-0006.flac," and there lay the longboat crushed into staves. the signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness, though my spirit sank again at the sight of my poor, drowned shipmates."
1297,4853-27671-0028.flac, air i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view. at the start i had a mind to steer northwest and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea.
1298,4853-27671-0000.flac," there were a few stars dying out in the dark west. the atmosphere was clear, and when the sun rose, i knew he would turn the sable-pull overhead into blueness. the hull lay very deep."
1299,4853-27671-0005.flac," had floated the jolly boat out of the longboat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay. as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use. for not long after, it had been floated out, the brig struck the burg, the mast fell."
1300,4853-27671-0008.flac," when she should be launched and lying alongside. ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash, shipping scarce a hat full of water."
1301,4853-27671-0016.flac," till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle. upon the eastern sea line, layer range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover."
1302,4018-107338-0012.flac," he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment. when observing that it was westminster, he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour, and that if not inconvenient to me—"
1303,4018-107338-0026.flac," there can be other than one and the same object? a thousand, said morley. we have already, as many parties, as insane stevens itself. you terrify me, since i will, i knew we had fearful odds to combat against."
1304,4018-107338-0031.flac," very useful, no doubt, i hope it shall find them, but of no validity. if money with the only difficulty, trust me, it should not be wanting. i owe much to the memory of your father, my good juard. i would fain serve you and your daughter."""
1305,4018-107338-0009.flac," then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance, she held forth her hand, which she retained for a moment, and withdrew. i was with him more than an hour continued morally. at first he recollected nothing."
1306,4018-107338-0001.flac," perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father,"" said hatton, scanning gerard with his clear blue eye, and then he added, ""...he was of great service to me and my youth, and one is not apt to forget such things."""
1307,4018-107338-0010.flac," he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers, would order research to be made for them and so on. i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father, what he was doing, and whether he were married and had children."
1308,4018-107338-0017.flac," had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father, which precipitated an explanation on his part, which he found had not been given by others, i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience."
1309,4018-107338-0020.flac," and yet, if anything were to happen tomorrow, said morley, rest assured this man has his eye on us. he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale, for though one of the pseudo-opposition, the moment the people move."
1310,4018-107338-0002.flac, and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted.
1311,4018-107338-0003.flac," and as he was speaking these words, he turned and addressed them to cybel. she beheld it with no little interest, this mysterious name that had sounded so often and then her young ears."
1312,4018-107338-0029.flac, saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed. you understand i have not the slightest out myself of your moral right. i believe on every principle of justice that mobry castle is as much yours.
1313,4018-107338-0032.flac," i'll not tell you what i would do for you, my good gerard. you would think me foolish, but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times. i really am scarcely fit for business."
1314,4018-107338-0008.flac, is yours at life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer.
1315,4018-107338-0027.flac," my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies, but i believed that we had on our side god and the truth. they know neither of them in the national convention said morally."
1316,4018-107338-0018.flac," you are right, said morally, looking at her rather keenly. we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservantly before this aristocrat. i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten, said"
1317,4018-107338-0016.flac," the mystification of which we have been jubes. and you did wrong, said sybil. there is no wisdom like franckness. had you told me he would not have been here today. he met and addressed me, and i only recognized an acquaintance."
1318,4018-107338-0011.flac," this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest. at first he talked of writing to see her father, and i offered that your arduous heart should call upon him."
1319,4018-107338-0028.flac," the factions and the failures of our oppressors. at this moment gerard and hatton, who were sitting in the remote part of the room, rose together and advanced forward, and this movement interrupted the conversation of civil and morally."
1320,4018-107338-0007.flac," is the privilege of the people, of whom i am one,"" said hathen bowing, well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a charters delegate. but is your labor their labor, since ible?"
1321,4018-107338-0025.flac," lawfully meeting an open day, and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race, which has in vain endeavored to degrade them."
1322,4018-107338-0015.flac," hers were kind and calm. and this egrimon said morally, rather hurriedly and abruptly, and looking on the ground, how came he here, when we discovered him yesterday, your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the..."
1323,4018-107338-0024.flac," morley shrugged his shoulders and then said, an easy question. questions are always easy. the fact is, in active life, one cannot afford to refine. i could have whisked the movement to have taken a different shape."
1324,4018-107338-0004.flac," and was associated with so many strange and high hopes, and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension, and discortant thoughts. hatton in his appearance realized little of the fancies."
1325,4018-107338-0000.flac," morley paused as he recognized egremont, then advancing to gerard, followed by his companion, he said, this is mr. hatten of whom we were speaking last night, and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours."
1326,4018-107338-0022.flac," you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means. do you not? what then is there to fear? and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive? all is very well at this moment, said morley, and all may continue well."
1327,4018-107338-0023.flac," but popular assemblies breed, turbulent, spirit-cibble. your father takes a leading part. he is a great hariter, and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life. it does not much suit me. i am a man of the classed."
1328,4018-107338-0013.flac," he would propose that i should at once accompany him. i thought, whatever might be the result, it must be a satisfaction to gerard, at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much. and so we are here."
1329,4018-107338-0019.flac," he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family, and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them."
1330,4018-107338-0006.flac, detract from the favorable effect that he always at once produced.
1331,4018-107338-0030.flac, as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land. but can we prove it? we never had the legal evidence. you are an error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence. mir memoranda.
1332,4018-107338-0005.flac," that appearance was pre-possessing. a frank and even benevolent expression, played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance. his once rich brown hair, still long, though very thin."
1333,4018-107338-0014.flac," you did well, good-steeve, and as you always do, said sible, with amusing and abstracted air, no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you. he threw a glance at her, and immediately withdrew it. their eyes had met."
1334,4018-107338-0021.flac," the factions become united. civil turn had looked at them and then said, and what could have happened tomorrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us? do not they know everything? do not you meet in their very sight?"
1335,4018-103416-0026.flac," not yet, but of course i shall be. when you really get going, i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made. i'm the most ignorant person you ever knew. i'd be awfully glad to."
1336,4018-103416-0003.flac," for the red cross and kindred activities. but although the war was in the nation's mind, it was not yet in its soul. life went on much as before, and abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency."
1337,4018-103416-0018.flac," her eyes slightly narrowed, watched him closely. she knew every move of the game she was determining to play. marion hayden, a 25, knew already what her little world had not yet realized, that such beauty as she had had..."
1338,4018-103416-0028.flac," he held himself very straight as he entered the house, and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler, had given place to a dignified nod. natalie was in her dressing-room. at his knock she told the maid to admit him."
1339,4018-103416-0022.flac," they met there, smoked your cigarettes, made love in a corner, occasionally became engaged, but she was of the game no longer in it. men still came to see her a growing percentage of the married."
1340,4018-103416-0017.flac," encouraged by her interest, he elaborated on the new work. he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise, and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder."
1341,4018-103416-0033.flac," she was holding out both hands to impidiously. you wouldn't go, would you? i might have to go, he evaded. you wouldn't, graham, you're all i have, all i have left to live for. you wouldn't need to go. it's ridiculous. you're needed here."
1342,4018-103416-0035.flac," and if we have, you won't go, promise me you won't go. when he hesitated, she resorted to her old message with both clayton and the boy. she was doing all she could to make them happy. she made no demands, none."
1343,4018-103416-0038.flac," and she had helped him out of a hole just now. all right, i promise he said it last, but you were worrying yourself for nothing, mother. she was quite content then, cheered at once, consulted the jeweled watch on her dressing table."
1344,4018-103416-0029.flac," his newfound maturity seemed to be slipping from him. somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy. honestly mother, i'd rather go to father and tell him about it."
1345,4018-103416-0012.flac," no, twitch steer, but i can't easily. mother, mary, and explained."
1346,4018-103416-0013.flac," well, do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night? not exactly, but i meant them. he looked up at her admiringly. he was only a year from college, and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debut"
1347,4018-103416-0014.flac," since the night before he had been wrangling under a sense of youth. was i pretty awful last night, he asked? you were very interesting, and i imagine rather indescreet."
1348,4018-103416-0002.flac," kept its secret well, and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce. war was, to most of the nation, a great dramatic spectacle, presented to them at breakfast, and in the afternoon additions."
1349,4018-103416-0009.flac," and tea cups on most of the furniture, and half smoked cigarettes on everything that would hold them, including the piano. marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing-room door."
1350,4018-103416-0007.flac," he was rather bored now at the prospect. he would have preferred going to the club to play billions, which was his custom of a late afternoon. he drove rather more slowly than was his custom, and so missed marion's invitation to get there before the crowd."
1351,4018-103416-0011.flac," permeated with the faint scent of late afternoon high-balls. tommy, mary and cole, when she had settled herself, yes, from a distance, did you leave your cigarette on the piano?"
1352,4018-103416-0024.flac," but more and more her dinder invitations were from the older crowd, like natalie spencer's stupid party the night before. so she watched graham and listened. he was a nice boy and a handsome one."
1353,4018-103416-0021.flac," were now sending flowers to the debutants and cutting in on the younger men at balls. her house was still a rendezvous, but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room, the library, and the music room that afternoon."
1354,4018-103416-0005.flac," but again, washington knew that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful, that the amount of loss territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held. that the food problem in the british islands was acute."
1355,4018-103416-0010.flac," i kept the library as long as i could, we can sit on the stairs if you like. which they proceeded to do quite amuletly. from various open doors came subdued voices. the air was pungent with tobacco smoke."
1356,4018-103416-0027.flac," well, go in and stir up some of the love as she suggested, and if tommy hale hasn't burned up the piano we can dance a bit, you dance to violently you know. it was after seven when he reached home, he felt every inch a man."
1357,4018-103416-0020.flac," she had the far vision of the calculating mind. she knew that if the country entered the war, every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer. at 25 she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers."
1358,4018-103416-0036.flac," but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her, it was refused, of course. she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money, and this was the gratitude she received. graham listened."
1359,4018-103416-0030.flac," she ignored his protest, as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters. i'm accustomed to it, was her sole reply, but her resigned voice brought her, as it always occurred."
1360,4018-103416-0015.flac," about the new war contract. oh, business."
1361,4018-103416-0032.flac," when, at a sound in clayton's room, he stuck the money hastily into his pocket. have you noticed a change in your father since he came back? her tone was so ominous that he started. he's not sick, is he?"
1362,4018-103416-0037.flac," she was a really pathetic figure, crouched in her low chair, and shaken with terror. she must have a rather bad time. there were so many things she dared not take to his father. she bought them to him instead, her small grievances."
1363,4018-103416-0006.flac," that the submarine sinkings were colossal. our peace was at a fearful cost. and on the edge of this volcano, america played. when graham spencer left the mill that tuesday afternoon, it was to visit marion hayden."
1364,4018-103416-0008.flac," three cars before the house showed that she already had callers, and indeed when the parliament opened the door, a burst of laughter greeted him. the hayden house was a general rendezvous. they were usually by seven o'clock whiskey and soda glasses."
1365,4018-103416-0000.flac," the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one. it was marked by an almost feverish gaity, as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self-interest."
1366,4018-103416-0034.flac," your father needs you. he needs me to hell of a lot, the boy muttered. but he went over and stooping down, kissed her trembling face. don't worry about me, he said lightly. i don't think we've got spined enough to get into the mix of anyhow."""
1367,4018-103416-0031.flac," the ready tribute of the boy's sympathy. sit down, graham. i want to talk to you. he sat down still and easily fingering the role of bills."
1368,4018-103416-0023.flac," they brought her centered tribute, flowers, candy and cigarettes."
1369,4018-103416-0001.flac," mills and factories took on new life, labor, were scarce and high. it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure. people played that they might not think. washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved."
1370,4018-103416-0016.flac," and i like big figures, poor people always do. has it really gone through? i mean those things do slip up sometimes, don't they? it's gone through all right, sign, sealed, and delivered."
1371,4018-103416-0019.flac," was the beauty of youth only, and that that was going. late hours, golf, perhaps a little more champagne, and was necessary at dinners, and the mornings found her almost plain. and two."
1372,4018-103416-0004.flac," the great six-month battle of the psalm, with its million casualties, was resulting favorably. on the east the russians had made some gains. there were wages that the germans would be done in the spring."
1373,4018-103416-0025.flac," also, he promised to be sole heir to a great business. if the war only lasted long enough. imagine you're knowing all those things she said admiringly. you're a partner, aren't you? he flushed slightly."
1374,4018-107312-0011.flac," were the mayor of moby-at-least. ""'wages,' said the man, ""'i wish you may get them. those villains shuffling screw have to serve me with another bait ticket and a pretty vigor too."""
1375,4018-107312-0026.flac," she added in a lower tone. well, i have left mr. trafford's mail, said the girl. that's a bad job, said mrs. carey, for those trafford's a kind to their people."
1376,4018-107312-0028.flac," and then i'm no scholar said the girl, and never could take the learning, and those traffords had so many schools. learning is better than house and lands that mrs. carey, though i'm no scholar myself, but then in my time things were different."
1377,4018-107312-0022.flac," to stop my tongue and fill my stomach. by the token of which, as my gall says, she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all mobri. and here the youth threw himself up, and thrust his hands into the side pockets of his pea jacket. well."
1378,4018-107312-0019.flac," a high-crowned dark-brown hat which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye. well, you need not be so fierce, mother carrey, said the youth with an affected air of deprecation."
1379,4018-107312-0001.flac," the dimensions of castle street were not unworthy of the metropolis. it traversed a great portion of the town, and it was proportionately wide. its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity."
1380,4018-107312-0009.flac," the subterranean nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest. the bright and lively shops were crowded, and groups of purchases were gathered around the stalls."
1381,4018-107312-0025.flac," said a good human voice. it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped. they were galley dressed, a light-hackachiff tied under the chin, their hair scrupulously arranged, they wore coral necklaces and earrings of gold."
1382,4018-107312-0010.flac," still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase. and so it is, widow, said a little pale man, wistfully. come, come, it's getting late, and your wife's ill, you're a good soul."
1383,4018-107312-0016.flac," wheel, indeed, you looked very like a soul as feeds on wheel, continued mrs. carey in an undertone as her declining customer moved away. well, it gets late, said the widow."
1384,4018-107312-0003.flac," in the infancy of mobri by some mill owner, not sufficiently prophetic of the future, or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labors..."
1385,4018-107312-0036.flac, i was speaking of it the harry at last night.
1386,4018-107312-0012.flac," oh, the carnal monsters exclaimed the widow. if they don't come, the bloody-minded naves. and for small cops, too, small cops be hanged. am i the man to send up a bad bottom-coped widow-carry?"
1387,4018-107312-0013.flac," you sent up for snakes. i have known you, man and boy, john hill, these twenty summers, and never heard a word against you till you got into shuffle and screws, mill. oh, they are a bad yarn, john."
1388,4018-107312-0017.flac," and if you like to take this scrag and home to your wife, neighbor hill, we can talk of the rest next saturday. and what you will, sir, said the widow, with a stern expression to her youth, who now stopped at her stall."
1389,4018-107312-0027.flac," so it is, said the girl, but then it was so dull, i can't stand a country life, mrs. carrey, i must have company. well, i do love a bit of gossip myself,"" said mrs. carrey, with great frankness."
1390,4018-107312-0002.flac," while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses, not as beautiful as the palaces of venice, but in their way not less remarkable, magnificent shops. and here and there, though rarely, some ancient factory built among the fields,"
1391,4018-107312-0037.flac," i proposed to go with her, but two girls alone, you understand me. one does not like to be seen in these places as if one kept no company. very true, said mick, and now will be off. good night, widow."
1392,4018-107312-0006.flac," that rose in all directions, clustering yet isolated, announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of mobri. crossing this open ground, they gained a suburb, but one of a very different description."
1393,4018-107312-0032.flac," and we shall be happy to see you, mick, and julia if you were not engaged, continued the girl, and she looked at her friend, a pretty demure girl, who immediately said, but in a somewhat faltering tone, oh, that we shall."
1394,4018-107312-0007.flac," to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with cyble. this one was populous, noisy and lighted. it was saturday night, the streets were thronged, and infinite population kept swarming to and fro."
1395,4018-107312-0004.flac," would be the future eyesore of a flourishing posterity. pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile, gerard and steve and turned down a street which intersected it."
1396,4018-107312-0030.flac," we have got fifty members and taken three london papers, one northern star and two moral worlds. and where you now, child, continued the widow to the girl."
1397,4018-107312-0034.flac," but at this season of the year, i must have life. the moment i came out, i bathed in the river, and then went home and dressed. he added in a satisfied tone, and now i am going to the temple. i'll tell you what. julia has been pricked today with a shuttle."
1398,4018-107312-0024.flac," it's very well known that i'm a man who pays his way, said the boy, and don't keep a hooks to stall to sell carry-in by store-light, but live in a two-pair if you please, and has a wife and family, or is good."
1399,4018-107312-0014.flac," so you do a solo widow, they pretend to give the same wages as the rest, and works it out in fine. you can't come and you can't go, but there's a fine. you're never paid wages, but there's a baked ticket."
1400,4018-107312-0023.flac," i never said mrs. carey. no, i never heard a thing like that."" what? not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for ville cutlet's mother? hold your tongue, mr. imperants, said the widow. it's very well known you know christian and who will believe what you say."
1401,4018-107312-0020.flac," ""'don't mother me,' said the jolly widow with the kindling guy, ""'go to your own mother who is dying in a backseller without a window, ""'while you've got lodging in a two-payer. ""'dying, she's only drunk,' said the youth."
1402,4018-107312-0033.flac," well, we had no thoughts, but i said to harriet, as it is a fine night, let us walk about as long as we can, and then tomorrow we will lie in bed till afternoon."
1403,4018-107312-0021.flac," what makes her drink but toil, working from five o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night, and for the like of such as you? that's a good one, said the use. i should like to know what my mother ever did for me, but give me treacle and laud, and when i was a babby."
1404,4018-107312-0005.flac," and so on, through a variety of ways and winding lanes, till they arrived at an open portion of the town. a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared, and where the tall chimneys and bulky, barric-looking buildings"
1405,4018-107312-0035.flac," i'll stand, treat, and take you and your friend to the temple. well, that's delight, said caroline. there's no one does the handsome thing like you, dandy mick, and i always say so. oh, i love the temple, it is so gentile!"
1406,4018-107312-0029.flac," but young persons, yes, said mick, i don't think i could get through the day if it were no for our institute. and what's that? ask mrs. carey with a sneer. the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure said mick."
1407,4018-107312-0000.flac, the chief street of mobury called castle street after the ruins of the old boronial stronghold in its neighborhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the hortie keep had been of its ancient dependence.
1408,4018-107312-0008.flac," by narrow archways, like the entrance of hives, so low that you obliged to stoop for admission. while ascending to these same streets, from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps,"
1409,4018-107312-0018.flac," he was about sixteen with a live figure and a handsome faded impudent face. his long loose white trousers gave him height. he had no waist cut, but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck."
1410,4018-107312-0015.flac," i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines. so the live, but those shuffling screw are rotten, and sneaky bad yarns of mistress carrie."
1411,4018-107312-0031.flac," if he will take a dish of tea with us tomorrow, we expect some friends. i take it kindly, said mrs. carey, and so you keep house together. all the children keep house in these days, times has changed indeed."
1412,7067-76047-0026.flac," it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection. still, i suppose custom-in-tradition kept this girl in her place, and she was petted, honored, amused."
1413,7067-76047-0006.flac," on the second occasion, sir richmond smiled again. frankly, said the doctor, this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me. it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life, this highway coupling."
1414,7067-76047-0039.flac, i see a lot more than that. you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible. negligible that is the exact word to them. you can't look at a woman for five minutes.
1415,7067-76047-0030.flac," probably bored her more than she realized. to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers, sweets, jewelry."
1416,7067-76047-0011.flac," am i?"" said dr. martinot and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face. i want to go on talking to miss grimmont for a day or so, sir richmond admitted, then i shall prefer to leave your party."
1417,7067-76047-0024.flac," her manner with miss seaford, an excellent manner for miss seaford by the by, isn't the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day, or for one person only. she is a very sure and commanding young woman. sir richmond nodded."
1418,7067-76047-0031.flac," and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position. before she was 20, i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presence. those who seek find."
1419,7067-76047-0018.flac," this young lady, whose charm and cleveness i admit, behaves as if the new age were already here. well, that may be a very dangerous mistake, both for her and for you. this affair, if it goes on for a few days more..."
1420,7067-76047-0010.flac," i'm twice her age. we are a party of four. there are conventions. there are considerations. aren't you really my dear martino, over doing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests?"
1421,7067-76047-0021.flac," miss seifert is a fairly crude mixture of frankness, insincerity and self-explanatory egotism, and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me."
1422,7067-76047-0049.flac," they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation, and there was very little more to be said. well, said sir richmond in conclusion, i am very sorry indeed, martino."
1423,7067-76047-0009.flac," she doesn't strike you, does she, as an undignified or helpless human being? her manners suggest a person of considerable self-control, and knowing less of me than you do. she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt, say."
1424,7067-76047-0014.flac," i shall be sorry, all the same. i could have wished,"" said the doctor, that these ladies had happened a little later. the matter was settled. nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said."
1425,7067-76047-0022.flac," now, i guess this miss gromont has had no mother since she was quite little."" your guess is, doctor, are apt to be pretty good, said sir richmond. you know that? she has told me as much."
1426,7067-76047-0032.flac," what do you think she found? what would a rich girl find out there in america? i don't know. i haven't the material to guess with. in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active, interesting men, rising politicians, university men of distinction."
1427,7067-76047-0008.flac," but isn't your attitude rather unfair, unjust indeed, and almost insulting to this misgramount? after all, she's a young lady, a very good social position indeed."
1428,7067-76047-0036.flac," or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didn't expect it. she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth. she has ceased to take the world for granted. it hasn't broken her, but it has matured her."
1429,7067-76047-0029.flac, she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration. that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely. miss cromont is not silly.
1430,7067-76047-0020.flac," and in many ways interesting. i've been watching her. i have not been favored with very much of her attention, but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile."
1431,7067-76047-0005.flac," so richmond said nothing. it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today, miss seaford has asked me if you were a married man. and of course you told her i was."
1432,7067-76047-0016.flac," and honor than they have ever been before. in matters of property, economics and public conduct, it will probably be just the reverse. then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence, legal insistence upon individual responsibility."
1433,7067-76047-0037.flac," that, i think, is why history has become real to her, which so attracts you and her. history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents. it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on."
1434,7067-76047-0015.flac," but neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision. when the new age is here, said the richmond, then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the inconveniences your present code would set about it."
1435,7067-76047-0045.flac," really, he said. this is preposterous. you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that. and the gulf in our ages. in our quality."
1436,7067-76047-0040.flac," seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity. miss gromont has an impulsive and adventurous character, and as i have been saying, she was a spoiled child with no discipline."
1437,7067-76047-0028.flac," i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her, or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them."
1438,7067-76047-0038.flac," she sees history as you see it and i see it. she is a very grown up young woman. it's just that, said sir richmond. it's just that. if you see as much and misgremont as all that, why don't you want to come on with us? you see the interest of her?"
1439,7067-76047-0012.flac," there were some moments of silence. i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma,"" said sir richmond, with a note of genuine regret in his voice. he is not a dilemma,"" said dr. martin o, with a corresponding loss of disparity."
1440,7067-76047-0043.flac," grotesquely happen,"" he said. she knows nothing of martin leeds. you must remember that. and then he added, if she and you fall in love."
1441,7067-76047-0048.flac, and at present the world has not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment. that is the core of this situation. a pause fell between the two gentlemen.
1442,7067-76047-0046.flac," from the psychologist of a new age, i find this amazing. are men and women to go on forever, separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds?"
1443,7067-76047-0041.flac," you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls. she is very much at loose ends. you, on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady, miss martin leads."
1444,7067-76047-0025.flac," i suppose her father adores and neglects her, and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butchered the thing has been done. these business-americans, i am told, neglect their women kind, give them money and power, let them loose on the world."
1445,7067-76047-0027.flac," talked about but not in a harmful way, and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war. theoretically, she had a tremendously good time. i think this must be near the truth of her biography, said sir richmond."
1446,7067-76047-0044.flac," as the phrase goes, what is to follow? there was a pause. sirichman looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offense."
1447,7067-76047-0035.flac," and something more than that. what it is, i don't know. the war has turned an ugly face to her. she has seen death and suffering and ruin. perhaps she has seen people she knew killed. perhaps the man has been killed."
1448,7067-76047-0023.flac," well, she impressed me as having the heir of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready-made solutions. that is how i inferred that there was no mother. i don't think there has been any stepmother."
1449,7067-76047-0013.flac," i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience, but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend, sir kenam latter, at bournemouth. nothing simpler than to go to him now."
1450,7067-76047-0017.flac," but we are not living in a new age yet. we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one. and you, if you will forgive me, are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications."
1451,7067-76047-0042.flac," you, i say, are also at loose ends. can you deny it? my dear sir, don't we both know that ever since we left london, you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in peticoats that seemed to promise you three her port of kindness?"
1452,7067-76047-0007.flac," don't you think, said sir richmond, that you are attaching rather too much, what shall i say? romantic, flirtatious, meaning to this affair?"
1453,7067-76047-0033.flac," she would find that life was worthwhile to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous, silly waste of time. with the facility of her sex, she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worthwhile for him."
1454,7067-76047-0019.flac," may involve very serious consequences indeed, with which i, for one, do not wish to be involved. sir richmond, upon the hearth rug, had a curious feeling that he was back in the headmaster's study at caxton."
1455,7067-76047-0047.flac, is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion? you ought to know even better than i do that there is not. for such people as you too anyhow.
1456,7067-76047-0034.flac," harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance. there have been love experiences, experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there."
1457,7067-76047-0002.flac," and bit his lower lip and considered, we might drop belinda. he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones. she is quite a manageable person. quite."
1458,7067-76047-0001.flac," a broad and original thinker as you are. thought is one matter, rash, inconsiderate action quite another, and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of miss..."
1459,7067-76047-0004.flac," for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree, and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum. i object to miss gremont, and that side of the thing, more than i do to miss efe."
1460,7067-76047-0003.flac," she could, for example, be left behind with a luggage and sent on by train. i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter. it needs only a word to misgremont. there was no immediate reply."
1461,7067-76047-0000.flac," after 24 eventful hours, our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room. they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension."
1462,7067-76048-0045.flac," and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter, and to schemes for giving her the complete control of all he had to leave her, provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway. after all,"
1463,7067-76048-0044.flac," at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that, when mr. gromant's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost."
1464,7067-76048-0020.flac," i've been talking of this sort of thing with my friend, dr. martino, and i've been thinking as well as talking, that perhaps is why i'm so clear and positive. i don't complain that you are clear and positive, i've been coming along the same way."
1465,7067-76048-0040.flac," she had no illusions about the power of the former class. it didn't exist. they were steered to their decisions by people employed, directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates, the owners of america, the real responsible citizens."
1466,7067-76048-0000.flac," i leave you to it."" his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation. ""'hot you to leave me to it?' smiled sir richmond. ""'i shall be interested to learn what happens, but if you won't stay to see."""
1467,7067-76048-0051.flac," and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake. gunter lake, sir richmond gathered, wasn't half a bad fellow. generally, it would seem miss gromont liked him, and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way,"
1468,7067-76048-0039.flac," that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote. she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes, and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well."
1469,7067-76048-0034.flac, sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martinot. he recalled to the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin.
1470,7067-76048-0043.flac," father, it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her. he despised and distrusted women generally, and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son."
1471,7067-76048-0008.flac, to a happy use by clamoring to the top of it and sliding on their little beehines down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing.
1472,7067-76048-0002.flac," section 2. for the better part of 40 hours, sir richmond had either been talking to miss cromont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence."
1473,7067-76048-0055.flac," for a number of trivial reasons, sir richmond found himself as scribing the project of this new age almost wholly to dr. martino, and presenting it as a much-completer scheme than he was justified in doing. it was true that dr. martino had not said many of the things sir richmond described to him."
1474,7067-76048-0011.flac," nobody is doing anything with the world except model about why not give it a direction. you take it in your hands like clay? obduet clay with a sort of recalcitrant, unintelligent life of its own."
1475,7067-76048-0003.flac, and she repeated no remembered comments and profits of her contemporaries about herself. she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality.
1476,7067-76048-0017.flac," we have been made an exception of, and got our rations. the big thing confronts us still."
1477,7067-76048-0033.flac, she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life. that isn't going on. she said with an effect of conclusive decision.
1478,7067-76048-0025.flac," making them matter as formally they didn't seem to matter. that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board. i suppose it has, she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before."
1479,7067-76048-0001.flac," ""'now, sir, please,' said the guard respectfully, but firmly, and dr. martin no-god in. sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit. what else could i do?' he asked aloud to nobody in particular."
1480,7067-76048-0016.flac," who have imaginations want something more nowadays. of course we want bright lives. of course we want happiness. just as we want food. just as we want sleep. but when we have eaten, when we have slept, when we have jolly things about us, it is nothing."
1481,7067-76048-0023.flac," the adolescence, so to speak, of mankind. it is an idea that seizes the imagination. there is a flow of new ideas abroad. he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears."
1482,7067-76048-0035.flac," he felt that this time at any rate, he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being. this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments."
1483,7067-76048-0036.flac," in the composition of so sure and gallant to personality. martin noe was very fine-minded in many respects, but he was an old maid, and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter."
1484,7067-76048-0041.flac," or they felt a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries. but anyhow they were steered. she herself, it was clear, was bound to become a very responsible citizen indeed."
1485,7067-76048-0005.flac," she liked his turn of thought. she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke. and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers, like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favored visitor."
1486,7067-76048-0015.flac," sensible little piggy-wiggies. we have a right to life and happiness. first, said sir richmond, as much right as a pig has to food, but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings"
1487,7067-76048-0024.flac, there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities. we are sharing the adolescence of our race. it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us.
1488,7067-76048-0048.flac," she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours, and at the end of the day she mentioned"
1489,7067-76048-0027.flac," but controlling father, as distinguished from managing him, she reviewed some private and amusing memories. he is a most intractable man."
1490,7067-76048-0031.flac," we don't get enough to do. we're spenders and wasteers, not always from choice. while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life, and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker."
1491,7067-76048-0021.flac," it's refreshing to meet you. i found it refreshing to meet mark no. a twinge of conscience about dr. martin no, turns a richmond into a new channel. he's a most interesting man, he said. rather shy in some respects."
1492,7067-76048-0029.flac," gunter lake, the big banker, she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him. all these people, she said, are pushing things about affecting millions of lives."
1493,7067-76048-0058.flac," what are we to do with such types as father, and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise? they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired, as a world scientifically ordered."
1494,7067-76048-0042.flac," she would someday, she laughed, be swimming in oil and such, like property. her interest in serrichment schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was, therefore, she realized, a very direct one. but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that."
1495,7067-76048-0006.flac," as a crisis in which they were called upon to do something. they did not yet clearly know what. into this topic they appeared as into some deep pool, side by side, and in it they saw each other reflected."
1496,7067-76048-0049.flac," this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of inquiry into mexico. there, apparently, she had really done responsible work. but upon the question of labor, mr. gromont was fierce."
1497,7067-76048-0004.flac," but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life, and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences, and her liking for serenishment was pleasingly manifest."
1498,7067-76048-0060.flac, and replaceable structures indeed. both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwant and courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before.
1499,7067-76048-0046.flac, he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicality of his life's ideal. there was hettie green. this latter idea had left her suddenly at the age of 17 from the educational care of an english gentleman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe.
1500,7067-76048-0053.flac," still quite vaguely guessing. so much fact about miss gromant, as we have given, had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half. the fragments came up as illusions, or by way of illustration."
1501,7067-76048-0054.flac," the sustaining topic was this new age, sir richmond foreshadowed. this world under scientific control, the utopia of fully developed people, fully developing the resources of the earth."
1502,7067-76048-0056.flac, but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with dr. martino. the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings.
1503,7067-76048-0012.flac, her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice. i believe what you say is possible if people dare. i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them.
1504,7067-76048-0059.flac," an immense organization of mature common sense, healthy and secure, gathering knowledge, and power for creative adventurers as yet beyond dreaming."
1505,7067-76048-0038.flac," her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond. i realize i've got to be a responsible american citizen, she had said."
1506,7067-76048-0030.flac," you will find my father extremely difficult, but some of our younger men would love it. and, she went on, there are american women who'd love it too. we're petted. we're kept out of things. we aren't placed."
1507,7067-76048-0022.flac," devoted to his work, and he's writing a book which has saturated him in these ideas. only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it, the psychology of a new age. the world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its history."
1508,7067-76048-0032.flac," with all the empty and speakable solemnity of the male, and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings. that can't go on, she said. her eyes went back to the long, low, undulating skyline of the downs."
1509,7067-76048-0050.flac, he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas.
1510,7067-76048-0014.flac," when pride ourselves upon our freedom from the sin of presumption, not quite that, well, how do you put it? we are afraid, she said. it's too vast. we want bright little lives of our own."
1511,7067-76048-0018.flac," i do not know why it should be so, but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind. i want it as my culminating want. i want a world in order."
1512,7067-76048-0026.flac," incidentally, he smiled, i want to get a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbaric person, your father, i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world control of fuel production and distribution."
1513,7067-76048-0052.flac," mr. lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behavior under bad treatment. there was some story, however, connected with her war services in europe upon which miss gromont was evidently indisposed to dwell."
1514,7067-76048-0009.flac," sir richmond and miss gromont had walked round the old circumvulation together, but belinda seifert had strayed away from them, professing an interest in flowers."
1515,7067-76048-0019.flac," a disciplined mankind going on to greater things. don't you? now you tell me of it, she said with a smile. i do. but before? no, you've made it clear. it wasn't clear before."
1516,7067-76048-0037.flac," but passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common. when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest, then it wasn't so necessary. it might happen."
1517,7067-76048-0010.flac, that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards that new world of yours of 250 million fully developed beautiful and happy people why not
1518,7067-76048-0028.flac, they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business. she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own.
1519,7067-76048-0057.flac," and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise. tomorrow the new age will be here no doubt, but today it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings. so that it was natural for miss gromont and sir richmond to ask,"
1520,7067-76048-0007.flac, its delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch. both miss gromont and miss ciford displayed an intelligent interest in their food. after lunch they had all gone out to the stones and the wall.
1521,7067-76048-0047.flac, after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and an office downtown. she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mr. gromont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard.
1522,7067-76048-0013.flac," i am tired of seeing all the world doing the same. i am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great disasters. here is something mankind can attempt, that we can attempt. and will? i believe that as mankind grows up..."
1523,87-121553-0080.flac," as cincinnati so cornealy and now. to such a quiet, such a beautiful life of the citizen, to such a safe community, and to so sweet and in, did marry give me with loud cries invoked, and in your ancient papter street once, christian and cassia guida i became."
1524,87-121553-0036.flac," or if in semicircle can be made triangle so that it have no right angle. when sifthal noticed this and what i said, a regal prudence is that peerless seeing in which the shaft of my intention strikes. and if on rose thou turnest thy clear eyes,"
1525,87-121553-0065.flac," then pleasant to the hearing and the sight, the spirit joined to its beginning things i understood not, so profound it spake. nor did it hide itself from me by choice, but by necessity, for its conception above the mark of mortal set itself."
1526,87-121553-0082.flac," i followed in his train against that law's iniquity, whose people doth usurp your just possession through your pastor's fault. thereby that executable race was i released from bonds of the fallacious world."

1639,5393-19219-0015.flac, their unhappiness formed a halo around their happiness. the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension. it was the same enchantment in two souls.
1640,5393-19219-0041.flac," let us be happy without quibbley and quirking. let us obey the sun, blindly. what is the sun? it is love. he who says love says woman. ah, ah, behold, omnipotence women."

1659,5393-19219-0035.flac," the armchair being occupied, m foshelevant was obliterated and nothing was lacking. in five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness. at dessert."
1660,5393-19219-0043.flac," there has been the imperial scepter surmounted by a globe. there has been the scepter of charlemagne, which was of iron. there has been the scepter of louis de great, which was of gold. the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger."

1662,5393-19219-0020.flac," they beheld the light of a rising sun. all at once, the clock struck. mario's glanced at cosette's charming bare arm, and at the rosy things, which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice, and cosette."
1663,5393-19219-0034.flac," from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute, cosette would not have regretted god himself. she set her sweet little foot."
1664,5393-19219-0024.flac," she caressed him with her smile. a banquet had been spread in the dining room. illumination, as brilliant as the daylight, is the necessary seasoning of a great joy. mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy."
1665,5393-19219-0028.flac," and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table. two large armchairs figured on the right and left of the bride, the first for emjele noemain, the other for jean-varjean."

1668,5393-19219-0022.flac, they pressed about cosette. each one vied with the rest and saluting her.
1669,5393-19219-0044.flac," it is done with, it is broken, it lies on the earth. there is no longer any septer. but make me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief which smells of patchouli. i should like to see you do it. try. why is it so solid?"
1670,5393-19219-0004.flac," evil has no right to exist, that there should be any unhappy men, is insooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky. evil does not come from man who is good at bottom. all human miseries have for their capital and central government. hell!"
1671,5393-19219-0012.flac," these two children or two lilies, they did not see each other, they did not contemplate each other. cosette perceived mario's in the midst of a glory. mario's perceived cosette on an altar. and on that altar..."
1672,5393-19219-0000.flac," to realize one's dream, to whom is this accorded, there must be elections for this in heaven. we are all candidates, unknown to ourselves, the angels vote. cosell and marius had been elected. cosell."
1673,5393-19219-0013.flac," and in that glory, the two apotheosis mingling in the background, one knows not how, behind a cloud for cosette. in a flash from aryus, there was the ideal thing, the real thing, the meeting of the kists and the dream."
1674,5393-19219-0014.flac," the nukchial pillow. all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication. it seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless nights, their tears, their anguish, their tears."

1677,5393-19219-0010.flac," and kosek, nestling close to marius, caressed his ear with an angelic whisper, so it is true. my name is marius. i am magam thau. these two creatures were resplendent."
1678,5393-19219-0011.flac, an irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy. they realized the verses of jean-proveil. they were forty years old taken together. it was marriage sublimated.
1679,5393-19219-0005.flac," good, here i am uttering demagogical words. as far as i am concerned, i have no longer any political opinions. let all me be rich, that is to say, merciful, and i can find myself to that. when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies..."
1680,5393-19219-0007.flac," and all being finished, cosette still could not believe that it was real. she looked at marius, she looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky, it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream."
1681,5393-19219-0006.flac," after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest, all possible yeses."
1682,5393-19219-0009.flac," and jean-varjant sat opposite them. anchillon au m'am had withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle. my children said the grandfather, here you are."
1683,5393-19219-0003.flac, could not give his hand to the bride.
1684,5393-19219-0001.flac," a necklace of fine pearls, a wreath of orange flowers. all this was white, and from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth. it was an exquisite candor, expanding and becoming transfigured in the light."
1685,5393-19218-0060.flac, or elsewhere. it's free wedding parties are at liberty. that's not the point at all.
1686,5393-19218-0027.flac," nearly at the same moment, the other file, which was proceeding toward the madeline, halted also. at that point of the file, there was a carriage load of maskers. these carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon loads of maskers,"
1687,5393-19218-0043.flac," that one of these shapeless clusters of masked men and women dragged about on a vast galash should halt on the left of the boulevard. while the wedding train halted on the right, the carriage load of masks"
1688,5393-19218-0056.flac," the first inspector who gets his eye on me will arrest me. you know that well enough. yes, i do. i'm bought by the government for today. all the same, that old fellow bothers me. do the old fellow's bother you, but you're not a young girl."
1689,5393-19218-0011.flac, now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact. it chanced.
1690,5393-19218-0044.flac," cuts side of the wedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the boulevard. hello, said a masquer. here's a wedding. a sham wedding retorted another, we are the genuine article. and being too far off to accost the wedding party."
1691,5393-19218-0036.flac," gady roars, sarcasm flames forth, joe violities flaunted like a red flag. two jades there drag first blossomed forth in an apotheosis. it is the triumphal car of laughter. a laughter that is too cynical to be frank."
1692,5393-19218-0002.flac," the manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is today. france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off one's wife, of fleeing."
1693,5393-19218-0005.flac," oats to the norman horses with their tails knotted up, falscaloons, furnished hat, long powdered locks, an enormous whip and tall boots. france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing, like the english nobility."
1694,5393-19218-0001.flac," it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a very spectacle, with a confusion of cherubum and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair. a marriage where they'd have formed the subject of a painting to be placed over a door. but it had been sweet and smiling."
1695,5393-19218-0013.flac, an accident happened to jean-bierre jean. he crushed the thumb of his right hand.
1696,5393-19218-0057.flac," he's in the first carriage. well, in the bride's trap, what then? so he's the father. what concern is that of mine? i tell you that he's the father, as if he were the only father. listen."
1697,5393-19218-0006.flac," and raining down on the post-chase of the bridal pair, a hailed storm of slippers trought in downed heel and of worn out shoes in memory of churchill."
1698,5393-19218-0055.flac," hurry up and jump down, trot my girl, your legs are young. i can't quit the vehicle. why not? i'm hired. ah, the devil. i owe my fishwife day to the prefecture. that's true. if i leave the cart."
1699,5393-19218-0049.flac," the breezes of february are not warm. as the fishwife clad in a low-necked gown, replied to the spaniard, she shivered, laughed, and coughed. here is their dialogue. say now. what daddy?"
1700,5393-19218-0041.flac," the populace has the mary andrew. paris is great, mad city on every occasion, that it is a great sublime city. they're the carnival forms part of politics. paris, let us confess it, willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy."
1701,5393-19218-0037.flac," there's government therein. there, when layswinsfinger on a mysterious affinity between public man and public women. it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up, should give a sum total of gady."
1702,5393-19218-0029.flac," toe wigs, pink tates, dandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer."
1703,5393-19218-0007.flac," which brought him good luck. old shoes and slippers do not, as yet, form a part of our nupsheel celebrations, but patience, as good taste continues to spread, we shall come to that. in 1833, a hundred years ago,"
1704,5393-19218-0010.flac," natural and commonplace, as this matter of marrying is, the vans to publish, the papers to be drawn up, the meurality, and the church produce some complication. they could not get ready before the 16th of february."
1705,5393-19218-0053.flac," never mind, that old cove who has something to matter with his paw, i know, and that i'm positive. and what good does a dude know him?"
1706,5393-19218-0000.flac," the night of the 16th to 17th of february, 1833, was a blessed night. above its shadows, heavens stood open. it was the wedding night of marius and cosette. the day had been adorable."
1707,5393-19218-0020.flac," mary andrew, pantalune, and clown persisted. in the good humor of that winter of 1833, paris had disguised itself as venice. such shrubbed tuesdays are no longer to be seen nowadays."
1708,5393-19218-0022.flac," those two brooks of carriages, flowing the one downstream, the other upstream."
1709,5393-19218-0017.flac, was in process of repaving. it was barred off.
1710,5393-19218-0018.flac," and jean-vaillant. marius, still separated from his betroth, according to usage, did not come until the second."
1711,5393-19218-0058.flac," what? i can't go out otherwise than masked. here, i'm concealed. no one knows that i'm here. but tomorrow there will be no more maskers. it's ash wednesday. i run the risk of being nabbed."
1712,5393-19218-0047.flac," in the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a spaniard with an enormous nose, an elderly air and a huge black mustache, and a gaunt fishwife who was quite a young girl."
1713,5393-19218-0033.flac," a lot to the bay lift of the palace, 20 su turnah for three coaches of masquerades in the crossroads. in our day, these noisy heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage, whose imperial they load down."
1714,5393-19218-0014.flac," nor even to see his hurt, not even coset. nevertheless, this had forced him to sway this hand in a linen bandage, and to carry his arm in a sling, and had prevented his signing."
1715,5393-19218-0028.flac," are very familiar to parisians. if they were miting on a show tuesday or at the mid-lent, it would be taken in bad part, and people would say, there's something behind that, probably the ministry is about to undergo a change."
1716,5393-19218-0031.flac," this is what that institution was like. greece stood in need of a chariot of the space. france stands in need of the hackney coach of ed. everything can be paraded, even parody. the setternalia."
1717,5393-19218-0003.flac," on coming out of a church of hiding oneself with shame from one's happiness, and of combining the ways of the bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs. people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisiteness."
1718,5393-19218-0008.flac," marriage was not conducted at a full trot. strange to say at that epoch, people still imagined that a wedding was a private and a social festival, that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity, the gaity even in excess."
1719,5393-19218-0030.flac," tormented with a butterfly, shouts directed at pedestrians, fists on hips, bold attitudes, bear shoulders, immodesty unchained, a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers."
1720,5393-19218-0046.flac," and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fish markets too extensive to retort to the enormous, flurable attacks of the populace. a frightful exchange of metaphors took place."
1721,5393-19218-0025.flac," honest family coaches loaded down with great aunts and grandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in disguise, clowns of seven years of age, columbines of six, ravishing little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of a public"
1722,5393-19218-0050.flac, do you see that old cove? what old cove? yonder in the first wedding card on our side.
1723,5393-19218-0012.flac," as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property, the papers had been simple."
1724,5393-19218-0019.flac," became entangled in a long procession of vehicles which form an endless chain from the madeline to the bastille, and from the bastille to the madeline. maskers abounded on the boulevard."

1726,5393-19218-0015.flac, and his capacity of cosets supervising guardian had supplied his place. we will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to the church. one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent.
1727,5393-19218-0009.flac," provided it be honest and decent, does happiness no harm. and that in short, it is a good and eventable thing that the fusion of these two destinies, once a family is destined to spring, should begin at home. and that the household should thence forth."
1728,5393-19218-0048.flac," and while their companions and the passives by were exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice. their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it. the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was wide open."
1729,5393-19218-0026.flac, one carriage delayed suffice to paralyze the whole line. then they set out again on the march. the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding toward the bastille and scourting the right side of the boulevard.
1730,5393-19218-0016.flac, to the church of st. paul at that epoch.
1731,5393-19218-0040.flac," the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation. certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace. and populace is like tyrants, require buffoons. the king has rokaloo."
1732,5393-19218-0004.flac," the most sacred of the souvenirs of life, mingled pale male with the tettetet of the conductor of the diligence and the maid servant of the inn. in the second half of the 19th century in which we are now living, the mayor and his scarf, the priest,"
1733,5393-19218-0032.flac," displaying her marble breast in the divine semi-neutity. having at the present day lost her shape under the soaked rags of the north, has finally come to be called the jack putting. the tradition of carriage loads of masqueras runs back to the most ancient days of the monarchy."
1734,5393-19218-0039.flac," that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, half-dung, half-light, roll a pie on four wheels, howling and laughing, that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames."
1735,5393-19218-0051.flac," yes, well, i'm sure that i know him. ah. i'm willing that they should cut my throat."
1736,5393-19218-0045.flac," and fearing also the rebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere. at the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had their hands full. the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd's caress to masquerades."
1737,5393-19218-0021.flac, anyone in these vehicles as it once a spectator and a spectacle. police sergeants maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current.
1738,5393-19218-0052.flac, can you see the bride if you stoop down? no. and the bridegroom? there's no bridegroom in that trap. buh. unless it's the old fellow. try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low. i can't.

1742,5393-19218-0061.flac," who that old cove belongs to, and where that wedding pair lives. i like that, that would be queer. it's so easy to find out a wedding party that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday a week afterwards, a pin in a heimo."
1743,5393-19218-0034.flac," or they overwhelm a hired lendow with its top thrown back with their tumultuous groups. twenty of them, riding a carriage intended for six, they cling to the seats to the rumble on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts."
1744,5393-19218-0059.flac," not particularly. more than i am at any rate, well what of that? you must try to find out where that wedding party went to. where it went? yes. i know. where's it going then? to the cutsal von blu."

1749,1334-135589-0003.flac," and he will soon be opposed to this truckulent and dishonest court, who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes, but who have never intended to keep their promises, and place me on the english throne."
1750,1334-135589-0102.flac," and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself. he then married clara redcliffe, who was not appeared lately on the scene, owing to her having been about two years before the restoration."
1751,1334-135589-0083.flac," as the saying is. her father will resign the property to you as you're by right. but you have no property in his daughter, and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you."
1752,1334-135589-0012.flac," and had been reinforced by troops from spain, set up the standard of revolt. edward and his friends joined them with about 300 english and scotchmen, which they had enlisted, and very soon afterwards."
1753,1334-135589-0014.flac," and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of st. antoine, in which neither party had the advantage."
1754,1334-135589-0084.flac," but why should you say so, humphrey? have we not been attached from our youth? yes, it was a youthful passion, i grant. but recollect, nothing came of it. and years have passed away."
1755,1334-135589-0055.flac," and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you. besides, merely for what may be called a point of honor, for it is no more, in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty?"
1756,1334-135589-0091.flac," after that speech, sir, the sooner you get back again, the better retorted edith. but edward made a sign to humphrey, and they beat a retreat. have you seen the intent in humphrey? no."
1757,1334-135589-0079.flac," mr. heatherstone may make his own terms. i must wave all pride, rather than lose her. i thought that i had more control over myself, but i have seen her. and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife."
1758,1334-135589-0058.flac," you were at the wars. it was possible that you might or might not return. he said this to humphrey, who has all long been acting as his factotum in the business. and recollect at the time that mr. heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion."
1759,1334-135589-0031.flac," it is so, i believe, replied edward, yes, now that he smiles, i'm sure it is them. yes, replied grandville."
1760,1334-135589-0080.flac," let her father but give me her, and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition. with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood, set humphrey, i can inform you what they are."
1761,1334-135589-0004.flac," i will give you letters to kanda and recollect that whatever general you take service under, you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong. that is not your affair."
1762,1334-135589-0006.flac," you are here highly spoken of, said the prince, for so young a man. so you were at the affair of worcester? we will retain you, for your services will be wanted by and by."
1763,1334-135589-0044.flac," and i understand is a very princely mention. humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong. it belongs to mr. heatherstone, does it not? replied edward?"
1764,1334-135589-0021.flac," made overtures of peace, which was gladly accepted by the french. during these wars, cromwell had been named protector, and had shortly afterward died."
1765,1334-135589-0007.flac, can you procure any of your countrymen? i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge. but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for. anymore?
1766,1334-135589-0020.flac," and expelled king charles from the french funchiers. the war was still carried on in the netherlands. teren bourdand kanda, who had gained every campaign, and the court of spain, weird with reverses,"
1767,1334-135589-0013.flac," kind of obtained the victory at belénan and in april 1652, advanced to paris. tyranne, who had taken the command of the french army, followed him."
1768,1334-135589-0025.flac," on 15 may 1660, the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth, and a large body of gentleman went to invite him over. the king sailed from shevelling."
1769,1334-135589-0062.flac," those who hold the property think so too, and so far it is fortunate. now, from wiserheads and mine."
1770,1334-135589-0033.flac," for while they had been speaking, the procession had stopped. is it possible, thought-edward, that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage, and yet it must be?"
1771,1334-135589-0042.flac," i can assure you, but she is as good as she is handsome, and moreover treats all the gay galants with perfect indifference. she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper, and her father is also in town."
1772,1334-135589-0049.flac," although not said, it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer, and i will accept no wife on such conditions. that is to say, because all you wish for, your property and the woman you love are offered you in one lot."
1773,1334-135589-0087.flac, and it may be true. reply that word morenfully. well...
1774,1334-135589-0040.flac," now, edward, who do you think was here today? the reigning bell and the toast of all the gentlemen? indeed, i must be careful of my heart. dear edith, who is she?"
1775,1334-135589-0095.flac," tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct. you are right, i will. i fear however, humphrey, that you are right and eateth wrong as regards his daughter."
1776,1334-135589-0028.flac," and his attendant, sout. shalenaer, edward, and granville, who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting, were certainly the most distinguished among the king's wets knew. look, edward."
1777,1334-135589-0008.flac," bring me the officers tomorrow at this hour, monsieur beverly, all-revois."
1778,1334-135589-0036.flac," allesson edith rose and waved their hanker chiffs, but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes. are those your sisters edward said the king? they are your majesty."
1779,1334-135589-0065.flac," and make the arrangements. that is advice which must be followed, reply that word. we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night. we may as well here inform the reader."
1780,1334-135589-0097.flac," on mr. heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood, expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct, simply adding, you may think me impetuous, sir, but i trust you will believe me grateful."
1781,1334-135589-0054.flac," recollect also that mr. heatherstone, and his brother-in-law, sir ashley cooper, have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do. they have been most important agents in his restoration."
1782,1334-135589-0032.flac, will they think you recognize us? we shall see. reply dead word.
1783,1334-135589-0064.flac," even a few days delay may make a difference. they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the monies. impressed that upon them, my dear edward?"
1784,1334-135589-0009.flac," edward went to schalenair and granville, who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them. the next day they were at the prince's levy and introduced by edward. i am fortunate gentlemen."
1785,1334-135589-0017.flac," he wrote a letter to the attendant, thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him, and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again. he did not, however, think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter."
1786,1334-135589-0041.flac," no less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted, edward. patience heatherstone. patience heatherstone cried edward, the toast of all london. yes, and deservedly so."
1787,1334-135589-0022.flac," edward, who but rarely heard from humphrey, was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain. but to leave his colors, while things were adverse, was impossible."
1788,1334-135589-0071.flac, edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve.
1789,1334-135589-0093.flac, that will be exclamation sufficient. i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere.
1790,1334-135589-0059.flac," what prospect was there of the restoration of the king? or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property? i believe, however, that humphrey knows more of mr. heather stone's intentions than he has made known to us."
1791,1334-135589-0105.flac," oswald, so soon as edward came down to arnwood, gave up his place in the new forest, and lived entirely with edward as his steward. and phoebe also went to arnwood, and lived to a good old age."
1792,1334-135589-0037.flac," the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obi sense to the window where they were standing. we shall have some court beauties, beverly,"" said the king, looking at him over his shoulder. as soon as the ceremonies were over."
1793,1334-135589-0000.flac," chapter 27 but we must follow edward for a time. on his arrival at paris, he was kindly received by king charles, who promised to assist his views in joining the army."
1794,1334-135589-0060.flac," and i therefore say again my dear edward, make no application to usertain what mr. heatherstone's intentions may be. your advice is good, my dear alice, and i will be guided by it. replyed edward."
1795,1334-135589-0099.flac," then always explain. about a year after the restoration, there was a fet at hampton court, given an honor of three marriages taking place. edward beverly, to patience heatherstone,"
1796,1334-135589-0039.flac," which it gave to edward to find his sister's grown, such accomplished and elegant young women. that his two friends who were, as the reader will recollect, old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received. we hardly need say."
1797,1334-135589-0005.flac," kanda is just now released from vincennes, but depend upon it, he will be in arms very soon. as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king, edward presented himself at the levy of the prince of kanda."
1798,1334-135589-0001.flac," you have to choose between two generals, both great and the art of war."
1799,1334-135589-0096.flac," nay, edward recollected i have as edith observed past my life in the woods. edward was most kindly received by mr. heatherstone. edward."
1800,1334-135589-0053.flac, which has been so long held by others.
1801,1334-135589-0056.flac," at all events, edward, recollect, you do not know what are the intentions of mr. heatherstone. wait and see what he propheses first. but my dear sister, it appears to me that his intentions are evident."
1802,1334-135589-0057.flac, why is he rebuilt on wood? he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house.
1803,1334-135589-0061.flac," and now, let me give you some advice for your friends, master schallonair and grenville. that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands, i know. and probably, they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king."
1804,1334-135589-0024.flac," and they then hastened to king charles, who had left spain and come to the low countries. at the time of their joining the king, richard, the son of cromwell, who had been nominated protector, had resigned, and everything was ready for the restoration."
1805,1334-135589-0045.flac," how can you say so edward? you received tomprey's letters a long while ago. yes, i did, but let us not talk about it anymore, my dear edith. i am in great perplexity."
1806,1334-135589-0023.flac," after the peace and the pardon of khanda by the french king, the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free. they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and maritalia services."
1807,1334-135589-0075.flac," and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward. after he had sluited her, the king said, loud enough for edward to hear."
1808,1334-135589-0089.flac," to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her. it may be so edith, replied humphrey, women are riddles. i only argue upon the common sense of the thing. much you know about women."
1809,1334-135589-0070.flac," mr. heatherstone, who led his daughter, patience. that they had not perceived him was evident. indeed, her eyes were not raised once, from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty."
1810,1334-135589-0069.flac," and waiting for the arrival of his sisters. shalenaire and granville were not with him. they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to. when his eyes caught, advancing toward the king,"
1811,1334-135589-0090.flac," reply, deedith, to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all of your life. very true, my dear sister, perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me."
1812,1334-135589-0047.flac," and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true. still, i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine, and that he has no right to give. i acknowledge his generosity."
1813,1334-135589-0051.flac," is receiving a favor, were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter? no. why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right? it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property."
1814,1334-135589-0048.flac," but i do not acknowledge his right of possession. nay, much as i admire, and i may say, fond as i am, for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter. it still appears to me that"
1815,1334-135589-0015.flac," and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards, he fell back to the frontiers of champagne. previous to his departure from paris, edward had received humphries letter explaining away the attendance conduct."
1816,1334-135589-0088.flac," you know humphrey, how many offers patients heather stone has had and has every day, i may say."
1817,1334-135589-0043.flac," with her today. when did you hear from humphrey edith? a few days back, he has left the cottage now altogether. indeed, where does he reside then? at arnewood, the house has been rebuilt."
1818,1334-135589-0026.flac," was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london, which he entered amid the acclimations of the people on the 29th of the same month. we may leave the reader to suppose that edward"
1819,1334-135589-0092.flac," i was about to call upon him, but i wanted to see you first. i will go with you. i have not done him justice,"" replied edward. and yet i hardly know how to explain to him. say nothing, but meet him cordially."
1820,1334-135589-0018.flac," except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects. it may be years before i see her again, thought edward, and who knows what may happen."
1821,1334-135589-0027.flac," were among the most favorite of those in his train. as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude, the windows of all the houses were filled with well-dressed ladies who waved their white kirchifts to the king."
1822,1334-135589-0063.flac," but at the same time, if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once, before the king's intentions are known, they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value. now is their time."
1823,1334-135589-0011.flac," and after my absence, you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required. a month after this interview, kanda, who had been joined by a great number of nobles,"
1824,1334-135589-0094.flac, what must he think of my not having called upon him? nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him you're coming with me will make it appear so
1825,1334-135589-0076.flac," i trust that the daughter will often grace our court. patients made no reply, but passed on. and, soon afterward, edward lost sight of her in the crowd."
1826,1334-135589-0104.flac," the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo, who became a very steady character. and in the course of time, married a young girl from arnewood and had a house full of young gypsies."
1827,1334-135589-0034.flac," well, shall an heir, to all appearance, your good aunts have done justice to their charge. nature has done more, edward. i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have."
1828,1334-135589-0085.flac," it is now seven years since you quit at the forest, and in your letters to mr. heatherstone, you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patients. since that, you have never corresponded or sent any messages."
1829,1334-135589-0077.flac," and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers. the sight of her so resplendent and beauty acted upon him like magic, and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over, and he was enabled to go to his sisters."
1830,1334-135589-0038.flac," and they could escape from their personal attentions, edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conning him and his sisters. we passed over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure"
1831,1334-135589-0086.flac," and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of 17 to 24 will cherish the image of one who, to say the least, had treated her within difference. that is my view of the matter edward. it may be wrong."
1832,1334-135589-0068.flac," on the following day a drawing room was to be held, and edward's sisters were to be presented. edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king, amusing himself with the presentations as they took place."
1833,1334-135589-0002.flac," and to ren. i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon. that will be the better for you, as you will learn tactics from such great players. which would your majesty recommend me to follow, inquired edward?"
1834,1334-135589-0050.flac," you will not accept them. they must be divided and handed over to you in two,"" said alice, smiling. he mistaked iris, i am not so foolish, but i have a certain pride which you cannot blame. accepting the property from mr. heatherstone."
1835,1334-135589-0098.flac, patients colored up and trembled when edward first saw her. edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance. he wooed her again and won her.
1836,1334-135589-0066.flac," that the advice was immediately acted upon, and that chalenaire and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years' purchase. edward remained at court several days. he had written to humphrey and had dispatched the messenger with the letter."
1837,1334-135589-0074.flac," and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him. and edward, in his own mind, agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day. mr. heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance."
1838,1334-135589-0072.flac," but little altered, except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure. and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed. or which time had not matured."
1839,1334-135589-0029.flac," at those lovely girls at yon window. did you recognize them? indeed, i do not. are they any of our paris beauties?"
1840,1334-135589-0052.flac," he cannot refuse it. put not your trust in prince's brother, replied alice, i doubt if the king or his council were considered advisable to make so many discontented."
1841,1334-135589-0081.flac," they are wholly unshackled. further than that, you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house. this i am empowered to state to you, and i think you will allow that mr. heatherstone"
1842,1334-135589-0016.flac," and the contents removed a heavy load from edward's mind. but he now thought of nothing but war, and although he cherished the idea of patience heather stone, he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could."
1843,1334-135589-0106.flac, in the capacity of housekeeper. her temper are becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years. this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties.
1844,1334-135589-0103.flac," claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country, and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house. he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey."
1845,1334-135589-0035.flac," although i always thought that they were handsome. as they passed, edward caught the eye of edith and smiled. alice, that's edward, said edith, so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him."
1846,5678-43303-0036.flac," i am back all as well. now listen, can you hear? yes, yes. the best has happened. it is all over in the east. thelsenberg has done it. now listen, i cannot come home tonight. it will be announced in paul's house in two hours from now."
1847,5678-43303-0019.flac," she was not offended, for she trusted her husband too well, but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating. the old lady too seemed excited. she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks, and hardly smiled at all to the girls greeting."
1848,5678-43303-0025.flac," as she came in, she took up the evening paper, but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would close that afternoon. 20 o'clock came, but there was no son of oliver. the paris-voller should have arrived an hour before."
1849,5678-43303-0018.flac," he seemed to move it something and mabel looked at him in astonishment. it is not eastern news, she asked. his eyebrows wrinkled a little."
1850,5678-43303-0008.flac, he made a little deprecating movement with his hands. it is not certain that she will die.
1851,5678-43303-0027.flac," of course, she might have missed it. there was no depending on its exact course, but she had seen it a hundred times before, and wondered un reasonably why she had not seen it now. but she would not sit down to dinner and paste up and down in her white dress."
1852,5678-43303-0026.flac," but mabel, staring out into the darkening heavens, had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one."
1853,5678-43303-0003.flac, she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight. the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body. the old lady was so tranquil and human.
1854,5678-43303-0017.flac," he will, will he not? you have not heard?"" mr. brandt said he would be here for a late dinner. he will reach slundered at 19. and is there any other news? he compressed his lips. there are rumors, he said. mr. brandt wired to me an hour ago."
1855,5678-43303-0012.flac," so the girl went downstairs once more, with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still. what a strange and beautiful thing death was, she told herself, this resolution of a cord that had hung suspended for 30, 50, or 70 years,"
1856,5678-43303-0038.flac," yes, quick! mother is ill, shall i leave her? how ill? oh, no immediate danger the doctor has seen her. there was silence for a moment. yes, come then. we will go back tonight anyhow then."
1857,5678-43303-0023.flac, and he had given her no news of the paris convention. he only repeated that mr. oliver would be back that night. then he had gone off in a hurry half an hour later. the old lady seemed to sleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her.
1858,5678-43303-0024.flac," neither did she like to leave the house, so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing, to the long shadow lay across the path, and the tumble platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west."
1859,5678-43303-0002.flac," and mabel, running upstairs in alarm at the message of the servant, found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair. it is nothing, my dear,"" said the old lady tremulously, and she added the description of a symptom or two."
1860,5678-43303-0009.flac," she asked. no, no, she may live ten years, i said. he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and went away. the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand."
1861,5678-43303-0000.flac," mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch, and for a few days did her best. but there was nothing that alarmed her. the old lady was a little quiet, perhaps, but went about her minute affairs as usual. she asked the girl to read to her sometimes."
1862,5678-43303-0029.flac," and the heavenly darkness. why did not oliver come, or at least let her know why he did not? once she went upstairs, miserably anxious herself, to reassure the old lady and found her again very drowsy. he is not come, she said."
1863,5678-43303-0033.flac," she had decided to touch them one by one and inquire whether anything had been heard of her husband. there was his club, his office in whitehall, mr. phillips' house, parliament' house, and the rest, but she hesitated telling herself to be patient."
1864,5678-43303-0030.flac," i dare say he may be captain paris. the old face on the pillow nodded and murmured, and mabel went down again. it was now an hour after dinner time. oh, there were a hundred things that might have kept him."
1865,5678-43303-0006.flac," her whole point, so to speak, lay in the delicate little fabric of personality, built out of fragile things, into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts. the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion."
1866,5678-43303-0034.flac," oliver hated interference, and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety. then, even as she turned away, the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight, whitehall. she pressed the corresponding button, and her hand shaking so much."
1867,5678-43303-0016.flac," where a heap of letters lay to be answered. a couple of hours later, as mabel went upstairs once more, she met mr. phillips coming down. he looked a little flushed under his shallow skin. mrs. brand sent for me, he said. she wished to know whether mr. oliver would be back tonight."
1868,5678-43303-0031.flac, he had often been later than this. he might have missed the valor he meant to catch. the convention might have been prolonged. he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire.
1869,5678-43303-0011.flac," for there was no past to set straight, no judge to be confronted. death was an ending, not a beginning. it was a peaceful gospel. at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come."
1870,5678-43303-0005.flac," she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul. for in that case, she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things."
1871,5678-43303-0021.flac," he will be back to dinner, will he not? if the volour is not late. no mother, are you ready for breakfast? mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation. it was certain that something had happened."
1872,5678-43303-0015.flac," mr. phillips arrived the next morning as usual, just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her. she is a little better, i think, said mabel. she must be very quiet all day."" the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room."
1873,5678-43303-0037.flac, we are communicating with the press. come up here to meet me at once. you must be present. can you hear? oh yes! come then at once. it will be the greatest thing in history. tell no one. come before the rush begins. in half an hour the way will be stopped. oliver.
1874,5678-43303-0004.flac," so absorbed in small external matters, so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth, so utterly without resentment or pivishness."
1875,5678-43303-0020.flac," said mabel. old mrs. brand looked at her sharply and instant, but said nothing. don't excite yourself, mother. oliver will be back tonight. the old lady drew a long breath. don't trouble about me, my dear,"" she said. i shall do very well now."
1876,5678-43303-0007.flac," the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace. it is synchipé,"" said the doctor when it came in. she may die at any time. she may live ten years. there is no need to telegraph from mr. brand."
1877,5678-43303-0022.flac," the secretary, who breakfasted with her in the partler looking onto the garden, had appeared strangely excited. he had told her that he would be away the rest of the day. mr. oliver had given him his instructions. he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question."
1878,5678-43303-0035.flac," that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear, she listened. who is there?"" her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice, tiny and manoeuvre across the miles of wire. i, mabel, she said, alone here."
1879,5678-43303-0032.flac," he might even have wired to mr. phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message. she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it. there it was, that round silent month, that little row of labeled buttons."
1880,5678-43303-0013.flac," back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself. those same notes would be struck again, were being struck again even now all over the world, though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch."
1881,5678-43303-0001.flac," she packed his bag with her own hands, set out his furs for the swift flight to paris, and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction. he would be gone three days, he said. it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill."
1882,5678-43303-0028.flac," turning again and again to the window, listening to the soft rush of the trains, the faint hoots from the track, and the musical chords from the junction a mile away. the lights were up by now, and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairy-lad between the earthly light."
1883,5678-43303-0010.flac," well, my dear, she asked. it is just a little weakness, mother. you must like quiet and do nothing. shall i reach you? no, my dear, i will think a little. it was no part of mabel's idea to duty, to tell her that she was in danger."
1884,5678-43303-0014.flac," but that particular emotion was gone. it was foolish to think that it was sounding internally elsewhere for there was no elsewhere. she too, herself, would cease one day, let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely."
1885,5678-43301-0000.flac, in his masonic insignia. it was he who had given immense impetus to that secret movement by his declaration in the house that the key of future progress and brotherhood of nations was in the hands of the order.
1886,5678-43301-0016.flac," the kingdom of god, it was said, lay within the human heart, and the greatest of all graces was charity. she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might, with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure a hundred yards away."
1887,5678-43301-0019.flac," of this great anniversary. then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present. 50 years ago the speaker said, poverty was still a disgrace, now it was so no longer."
1888,5678-43301-0002.flac," and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ. thus, he had pre-looted his speech on the poor-law question, pointing to the true charity that existed among masons, apart from religious"
1889,5678-43301-0017.flac," and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or two across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him. then he stepped back, and oliver came forward. it was too far for the two to hear what was said, but mabel slipped a paper, smiling tremulously."
1890,5678-43301-0006.flac," and converged toward the wide railed space about the platform, where room was reserved for them. the windows on every side were packed with faces. tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and st. martin's church."
1891,5678-43301-0021.flac," he enumerated the reforms past fifty years before on this very day, by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate. so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty."
1892,5678-43301-0014.flac, and all england was familiar with it. old mrs. brand lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes and saw the words that she knew so well. the lord that dwells in earth and sea.
1893,5678-43301-0018.flac," into the old lady's hand and herself bent forward to listen. old mrs. brand looked at that too, knowing that it was an analysis of her son's speech, and to where that she would not be able to hear his words."
1894,5678-43301-0008.flac, the old column was gone with its lions.
1895,5678-43301-0009.flac," nor the lions to the new art, and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery. overhead, the roofs showed crowded freezes of heads against the blue summer sky."
1896,5678-43301-0007.flac," garden beds of color behind the mute white statues that faced outwards round the square. from brave weight in front, past the victorians, john davidson, john burns, and the rest, round to hampton and to montfort toward the north."
1897,5678-43301-0001.flac," it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted. st. paul had been right, he declared, in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations."
1898,5678-43301-0010.flac," not less than 100,000 persons it was estimated in the evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon. as the clocks began to tell the hour, two figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward. and in an instant..."
1899,5678-43301-0012.flac," and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion. behind him came oliver, bareheaded and spruce, and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement."
1900,5678-43301-0004.flac," and this platform was hung with roses, surmounted by a sounding board, and set with a chair and table. the whole square roundabout was paved with heads and a resonant with sound, the murmurs of thousands of voices."
1901,5678-43301-0026.flac," and a storm of laughter rippled around the throng of heads. she heard an in-drawn hiss behind her chair, and the next instant an exclamation from mabel. what was that? there was a sharp crack, and the tiny, just stimulating figure staggered back a step."
1902,5678-43301-0013.flac," there was no doubt that these londoners could sing. it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody, rising to enthusiasm till the music of masked bands followed it as a flag follows a flag stick. the hymn was one composed ten years before."
1903,5678-43301-0005.flac," overpowered now and again by the crash of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds, each headed by a banner."
1904,5678-43301-0020.flac," it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay. who would not honor a man worn out in the service of his country, or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail?"
1905,5678-43301-0015.flac," had been composed with both skill and order. they had a religious ring. the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm, yet their sense was plain enough. the old human creed that man was all. even christ's words themselves were quoted."
1906,5678-43301-0024.flac," a couple of women with an old man directly behind and other faces visible again behind them. their obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction and she turned resolutely once more to the square. ah, he was working up now to his panagiric."
1907,5678-43301-0025.flac," the tiny dark figure was back, a yard nearer the statue, and as she looked, his hand went up and he wheeled, pointing as a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice. then again, he was forward, half-crouching, for he was a born actor."
1908,5678-43301-0003.flac," and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak. a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesmen appeared to be one of the speakers, though at a slightly higher elevation."
1909,5678-43301-0022.flac," and its reward, and that, he's supposed, together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws would form the first half of his speech. the second part was to be a panagiric of brave weight, treating him as the precursor of a movement that even now had begun."
1910,5678-43301-0027.flac," the old man at the table was up in a moment, and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were masked and directly opposite the front of the platform."
1911,5678-43301-0011.flac," the murmurs of talk rose into cheering. old lord pemperdon came first, a grey-haired upright man, whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over 70 years ago, and his son had succeeded him worthily."
1912,5678-43301-0023.flac," old mrs. brand leaned back in her seat and looked about her. the window where they sat had been reserved for them. two arm chairs filled the space, but immediately behind there were others, standing very silent now, craning forward, watching, two with parted lips."
1913,5678-43302-0029.flac," toe-bolt's, cabanares, yacchus, everywhere, and he's been to australia."" mabel set up briskly. isn't that very hopeful? i suppose so. there's no doubt that the sufis are winning, but for how long is another question?"
1914,5678-43302-0025.flac," all of us stirred presently. did you notice anything just now, sweetheart, when i said that about jesus christ? she stopped knitting for a moment, said the girl. he nodded. you saw that too, then."
1915,5678-43302-0011.flac," speaking in defense of his principles, it was an incalculable gain for them, and loss for the individualists, that confessors were not all on one side after all."
1916,5678-43302-0018.flac," my dear, i feel very downcast sometimes, as you know. well, i do not think i shall be again. i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit, and that the old toys were partly right. when they prophesied, what communism would do?"
1917,5678-43302-0007.flac," but he must have meant to do it anyhow. continued oliver. how do they know he was a catholic? ask the girl again. there was a rosary on him, and then he just had time to call on his god. and nothing more is known."
1918,5678-43302-0010.flac," caldecott, the prime minister, maxwell, snowford, and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations. and from every part of england, streamed in message after message. it was an immense stroke for the communists."
1919,5678-43302-0040.flac," it was on too large a scale. occasionally, people went mad, people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height, when it said glimpse of reality could be obtained, and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness, but that was all."
1920,5678-43302-0003.flac," but, well, i dare say it was more merciful. but, you did what you could, my dear?"" said the old lady anxiously from the corner. i called out to them, mother, but they wouldn't hear me."
1921,5678-43302-0030.flac," besides, the troops don't disperse. in europe? europe is arming as fast as possible. i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris. i must go. you are arm my dear. my arm must get well. it will have to go with me anyhow."
1922,5678-43302-0033.flac," these new benin shine explosives will make certain of that. but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them? absolutely. benin shines sold them simultaneously to east and west, then he died, luckily for him. maybe i had heard this kind of talk before."
1923,5678-43302-0039.flac," european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual. men still built houses, married wives, begat sons and daughters, did their business and went to the theater for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else. they could neither save nor precipitate the situation."
1924,5678-43302-0024.flac," but she could see what she loved to see, that response to her own heart. and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more, and the click of the rider in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs."
1925,5678-43302-0021.flac," if only this infernal eastern affair would end, he knew he was feverish and irritable, and made a great effort to drive it down. oh, my dear, he went on, flushed a little."
1926,5678-43302-0015.flac," there was some passion and loyalty left in england. his mother got up presently and went out, still without a word, and mabel turned to him, laying a hand on his knee. are you too tired to talk, my dear?"" he opened his eyes."
1927,5678-43302-0012.flac, the huge electric placards over london had winged out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight oliver brand wounded catholic assailant indignation of the country
1928,5678-43302-0035.flac," now, if tales were true, entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell. the new conditions were unimaginable. military experts proficied extravagantly, contradicting one another on vital points."
1929,5678-43302-0019.flac," but after this, well, well, we have shown that we can shed our blood to. it is in the neka time too, just at the crisis. i don't want to exaggerate. it is only a scratch, but it was so deliberate in."
1930,5678-43302-0014.flac," he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face, and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and torn at his throat. then the face had vanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared. oh!"
1931,5678-43302-0036.flac," the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory. there were no precedents with which to compare it. it was as if archer's disputed as to the results of cordite. only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine, and as regards male population,"
1932,5678-43302-0022.flac," if they would not be such heavy fools, they don't understand. they don't understand. yes, oliver? they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is. humanity, life, truth at last, and the death of folly, but haven't i told them a hundred times?"
1933,5678-43302-0031.flac," tell me some more. there is no more, but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis. if the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now, it will never be likely to raise it again. it will mean free trade all over the world, i suppose."
1934,5678-43302-0038.flac," founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world. felsenberg's name appeared more frequently than ever, otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush. nothing suffered very much, trade went on."
1935,5678-43302-0016.flac," of course not my darling, what is it? what do you think will be the effect? he raised himself a little, looking out as usual through the darkening windows onto that astonishing view."
1936,5678-43302-0008.flac," nothing more. he was well dressed, though. oliver leaned back a little weirdly and closed his eyes. his arms still throbbed intolerably. but he was very happy at heart. it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic"
1937,5678-43302-0034.flac," but her imagination simply refused to grasp it. a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing. there had been no european war within living memory, and the eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions."
1938,5678-43302-0020.flac," and so dramatic the poor devil could not have chosen a worse moment. people won't forget it. mabel's eyes shone with pleasure. you poor deer, she said. are you in pain? not much, besides christ."
1939,5678-43302-0001.flac," but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors. he was a catholic, explained the drawn-faced oliver. he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded."
1940,5678-43302-0005.flac," she said, then she broke off and sat back. why did he shoot just then?"" she asked. oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother, but she was knitting tranquilly. then he answered with a curious deliberateness."
1941,5678-43302-0037.flac," half as much again as the rest of the world but together, and the conclusion to be drawn from these premises was not reassuring to england. but imagination simply refused to speak. the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day."
1942,5678-43302-0028.flac," she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years. well, watch her, won't you? by the way, yes? there's a little more news from the east. they say felsenberg's running the whole thing now. the empire is sending him everywhere."
1943,5678-43302-0027.flac," no, my dear, you're excited and tired. it's just a little sentiment. oliver, i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her. but she hears it everywhere now. no, she doesn't. remember."
1944,5678-43302-0026.flac," maybe, do you think she is falling back? oh, she is getting old,"" said the girl lightly. of course she looks back a little. but you don't think it would be too awful. she took her head. no."
1945,5678-43302-0004.flac," maybe leaned forward. oliver, i know this sounds stupid of me, but i wish they had not killed him. oliver smiled at her. he knew this tender trait in her. it would have been more perfect if they had not."
1946,5678-43302-0023.flac," she loved to see him like this, his confident, flushed face, the enthusiasm in his blue eyes, and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with passion. she bent forward and kissed him suddenly. my dear, i am so proud of you. oh, oliver, he said nothing."
1947,5678-43302-0032.flac," and all that kind of thing, but if not, well, if not, there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined."
1948,5678-43302-0006.flac," i said that braithwaite had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together. he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second, then they went on again as before."
1949,5678-43302-0000.flac," oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home, leaning back in his chair with one arm bandaged and in a sling. they had not been able to get near him at the time, the excitement in the square had been too fierce."
1950,5678-43302-0002.flac," well, there was no chance for a priest this time. mabel nodded slowly. she had read of the man's fate on the placards. he was killed, trampled, and strangled instantly. said oliver, i did what i could, you saw me."
1951,5678-43302-0013.flac," well-deserved fate of assassin. he was pleased too that he honestly had done his best to save the man. even in that moment of sudden and acute pain, he had cried out for a fair trial, but he had been too late."
1952,5678-43302-0009.flac," but he was not sorry to bear pain in such a cause, and it was obvious that the sympathy of england was with him. mr. phillips even now was busy in the next room, answering the telegrams that poured in every moment."
1953,5678-43302-0017.flac," everywhere now lights were glowing, a sea of mellow moons just above the houses, and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening. the effect, he said, it can be nothing but good. it was time that something happened."
1954,8975-270782-0044.flac," subsequently, every opportunity is made use of to disparage the new arrival, and even attempts to do him bodily harm, direct attacks are not unheard of."
1955,8975-270782-0092.flac," others maintain that because of having lived together since early childhood, the sexual desire is diverted from the person's under consideration. in both cases furthermore, the incest avoidance would be automatically assured."
1956,8975-270782-0059.flac," because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny their significance in life, and to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing, much oftener than it really is fulfilled. but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth."
1957,8975-270782-0003.flac," but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken. the antiquity into which the dream work carries a spack is of a double aspect. firstly, the individual antiquity, childhood, and secondly, insofar as every individual in his childhood,"
1958,8975-270782-0097.flac," since the dream regresses to this stage, it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us. but it is only a deceptive appearance, by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened. we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams."
1959,8975-270782-0028.flac," this wish was no stranger to him. while the child was still a suckling, this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die, he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom."
1960,8975-270782-0103.flac," which, however, disclose only the beginnings of new riddles, new doubts. first, through aggression of dreamwork is not only formal, it is also of greater import. it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression,"
1961,8975-270782-0089.flac," when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses, it means only that the dream has in this field."
1962,8975-270782-0071.flac," and this love is substituted for the outworn love. one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the adipis complex. on the contrary, it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults."
1963,8975-270782-0037.flac," we have wandered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature, and certainly we're not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question. after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past,"
1964,8975-270782-0002.flac," so we call the mode of expression of the dream work, the archaic, or regressive. you may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dream work, we gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our intellectual development. i trust this will be true."
1965,8975-270782-0022.flac," in the most favorable circumstances, does not attack the interpretation itself. he almost always asks the question, when such a wish comes."
1966,8975-270782-0024.flac," the woman whose dream is interpreted to mean that she would like to see her 17-year-old daughter dead discovers under our guidance that she, in fact, at one time entertain this wish."
1967,8975-270782-0041.flac," for his brothers and sisters, with that what she has for his parents."
1968,8975-270782-0082.flac," under the pressure of education. he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes, rather a credit to both the same genital formation."
1969,8975-270782-0085.flac, and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business. these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child.
1970,8975-270782-0107.flac," how does one solve this contradiction? we begin to see that a distinction must be made, something that originates in our conscious life, and that shares its characteristics."

2093,1502-122619-0065.flac," in a formal assemblage of the nation. as such meetings were rare and only called on occasions of the last importance, the subtle huron who still sat apart."
2094,1502-122619-0041.flac," my brother is a wise chief. he is welcome. the hurons love their friends, the delaware's, returned magwa. why should they not? they are colored by the same sun, and their trust men will hunt in the same grounds after death."
2095,1502-122619-0063.flac, escaped his vigilant eyes.
2096,1502-122619-0048.flac," that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements. their distant villages, their hunting grounds,"
2097,1502-122619-0089.flac," the eyes of the old man were closed, as though the organs were weird with having so long witnessed the self-worth working to the human passions."
2098,1502-122619-0021.flac, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit. and yet i'll be trained the least in patience by sign or word. during the short of frugal repasse the followed.
2099,1502-122619-0079.flac," was rich in imposing, though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe. his robe was of the finest skins, which had been deprived of their fur."
2100,1502-122619-0050.flac," with manifest disappropriation, if not with alarm."
2101,1502-122619-0068.flac, the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to sow solemn and unusual occurrence. but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain.
2102,1502-122619-0007.flac, the woman ran from lodge to lodge.
2103,1502-122619-0046.flac," would have entitled morgwach the reputation of a skillful diplomatist. the recent defection of the tribe had, as they well knew themselves, subjected the delaware's to much reproach among their french allies."
2104,1502-122619-0074.flac," and three men issuing from it slowly approached the place of consultation. they were all aged, even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached. but one in the center who leaned on his companions for support"
2105,1502-122619-0000.flac," brief, i pray for you. for you see, it is a busy time with me. much to do about nothing. the tribe, or rather half tribe of delaware's"
2106,1502-122619-0042.flac," the red skins should be friends, and look with open eyes on the white men. has not my brother sent its spies in the woods? the delaware, whose name in english signified heart heart."
2107,1502-122619-0092.flac," and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat a blessing. the younger man were content with touching his robe, or even drawing nihah's person."
2108,1502-122619-0025.flac, when was it ever otherwise returned magwa? he calls my people most beloved. the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued.
2109,1502-122619-0081.flac, he also wore armlets as cinchers above the ankles of the latter precious metal.
2110,1502-122619-0093.flac, so just and so valiant. numb at the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presume so far as to perform the latter ceremony. the great mass of the multitude deeming in his sufficient happiness
2111,1502-122619-0004.flac," that it once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection, and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters. as for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce to monk haum through his emma series with indian brevity."
2112,1502-122619-0082.flac," in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks. his tomhawk was nearly hidden silver, and the handle of his knife shone like horn of solid gold. so soon as the first home of emotion and pleasure,"
2113,1502-122619-0073.flac," that always proceeded at conference, but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy. occasionally, an eye was raised from the earth, where the looks of most were riveted."
2114,1502-122619-0095.flac," arose, left the crowd, and inert the lodge, which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning."
2115,1502-122619-0054.flac," la long carabin. the delaware warriors started the well-known name, betraying by their amazement that they now learned for the first time. once so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power."
2116,1502-122619-0069.flac, his numbers some quite exceeded a thousand souls.
2117,1502-122619-0084.flac, was whispered from mouth to mouth. magwai had often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware.
2118,1502-122619-0022.flac," and related entirely to the events of the hunt, in which magwa had so lately been engaged. it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than to his hosts."
2119,1502-122619-0028.flac," does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers? she is welcome. the path between the curons and the delaware is short, and it is open. let her be sent to my squas if she gives trouble to my brother."
2120,1502-122619-0002.flac," though they had sinned fit, with the mysterious reserves of common among the natives, to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required. the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of the ally."
2121,1502-122619-0076.flac," the elastic, light step of indian was gone. and in this place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground."
2122,1502-122619-0019.flac," he is com repeated magua, bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince. the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist, then once more exchange friendly salutations."
2123,1502-122619-0077.flac," his dark, wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders."
2124,1502-122619-0061.flac," magwa had not only maintained his seat, but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge."
2125,1502-122619-0024.flac, is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children?
2126,1502-122619-0055.flac," what does my brother mean to me at a lakurdur? in a tone that, by its wonder, far exceeded the usual apathy of his race. a hero never lies, return magwa coldly."
2127,1502-122619-0031.flac, it is well. justice is the master of a red skin. why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other? are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers?
2128,1502-122619-0011.flac," as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts. during the existence of this scene, a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock, which formed the level of the village."
2129,1502-122619-0086.flac, the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out of a little from the throng.
2130,1502-122619-0058.flac," the boys deserve their sports, and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration. as they heard the brief exclamation of wonder, they so freely expressed the tromity of their hated foe."
2131,1502-122619-0096.flac," ascording the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment. the crowd opened in a lane, and when the party had re-entered."
2132,1502-122619-0036.flac," it is well. the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy,"" said magwa. once more shifting his ground."
2133,1502-122619-0040.flac," so aptly mingled with praise, in the eyes of those he addressed. this world judged and polite stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results."
2134,1502-122619-0083.flac, which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided.
2135,1502-122619-0088.flac," the americans sometimes call their tutelers saint taminé, a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced."
2136,1502-122619-0037.flac," and gravely spread his presence before the dazzled eyes of his hosts. they consisted, principally of trinkets of little value, plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry."
2137,1502-122619-0072.flac," on the pressurification the aged warrior was privileged it was to speak, with silent, seemingly oppressed with a magnitude of his subject. the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause."
2138,1502-122619-0039.flac," compliments has left them no ground of complaint. in short, the whole ceremony contains such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering, that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity."
2139,1502-122619-0034.flac," let my canada father come, which are the other evasively. his children are ready to see him. when the great chief comes, it is to smoke with the indians of their wigwans. the hurons say, too, he is welcome."
2140,1502-122619-0023.flac, notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware.
2141,1502-122619-0029.flac," she is welcome, return the chief of the latter nation, still more infatically. the battled magwa continued to silence several minutes, apparently indifferent, however, to the repulsied received."
2142,1502-122619-0018.flac, composed of cracked corn and beans. it is much used also by the whites. by corn is meant maze.
2143,1502-122619-0013.flac," by throwing his arm upward toward heaven, and then letting it fall impressively on his breast."
2144,1502-122619-0006.flac," on that morning, when maghwala led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests, in the manner described, the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people."
2145,1502-122619-0043.flac, an appellation that the french had translated into a core duor. forgot that a bureaucracy of purpose.
2146,1502-122619-0078.flac," since they had last been shorn. the dress of this patriarch, for such considering his vast age, in conjunction with his affinity and affluence with his people, he might very properly be termed."
2147,1502-122619-0053.flac," that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delaware's. go, my great canada father is not a fool."
2148,1502-122619-0035.flac, but the yankees have long arms and legs that never tire.
2149,1502-122619-0026.flac," the tomahawks of your young men have been very red. it is so, what they are now bright and dull, for the enkeys are dead, and the delawares are in neighbors."
2150,1502-122615-0001.flac, the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior tremble. the greyhead and the sagamore are safe.
2151,1502-122615-0038.flac, not so. they who were the pedicodes of squaws on their own river. one of them has been passing the tribe. did my young men take a scalp?
2152,1502-122615-0014.flac," i thank him, and you will spare lives in the wife of one of my young men. can the cunning stranger frighten him away?"" hayward possessed some knowledge in the memory practiced among the indians."
2153,1502-122615-0016.flac," that would have given him more satisfaction. aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character, however, he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery."
2154,1502-122615-0015.flac, in the cases of such supposed visitations. he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends. it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal.
2155,1502-122615-0033.flac, the expression of a zai contradicted his figurative and boastful language.
2156,1502-122615-0022.flac," drew his tomahawk from his girdle, and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle."
2157,1502-122615-0018.flac," equal to that maintained by the chief, who was in truth a new relative of the afflicted woman. the minutes lingered and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventure in empiricism. the hero only decided his pipe."
2158,1502-122615-0025.flac, as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant. the smoke reeds above their heads little eddies.
2159,1502-122615-0008.flac," prove favorable to his views, and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected and advantage. without seeming to hesitate."
2160,1502-122615-0003.flac," but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door, and it managed him with the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse. slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mangled with the throng that hovered nigh."
2161,1502-122615-0032.flac," he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself. i have done."" the speaker who was the father of the yadkriyant young indian looked round and about him."
2162,1502-122615-0021.flac, several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again.
2163,1502-122615-0019.flac," and drew his robe across his breast, as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid. just then, a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door, and stalking silently among the attentive group."
2164,1502-122615-0020.flac," he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush, which sustained duncan. the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magwa."
2165,1502-122615-0002.flac," go, anke's and the open hand are now strangers. it is enough."
2166,1502-122615-0004.flac," the dying fires and the clearing cast a demon on certain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro, and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced to the lodge, and exhibited the figure of ankhas."
2167,1502-122615-0012.flac," he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech. when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal. unfortunately, for this prudent resolution, his entertainers appear otherwise disposed."
2168,1502-122615-0036.flac," suffered him to depart in silence. then, with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate, one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men."
2169,1502-122615-0013.flac," he in not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade, when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him. my canada father does not forget his children said the chief."
2170,1502-122615-0029.flac," like most around him for more than a minute his look too was on the ground, but trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside. he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention."
2171,1502-122615-0011.flac," in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty. still, he was excluded from all participation in the discourse, and possessed much more of the air of some finally molded statue than a man having life and volition."
2172,1502-122615-0023.flac," ten minutes, which appeared so many ages to duncan, might have passed in this manner. and the warriors were fairly enveloped in this cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke."
2173,1502-122615-0010.flac," david had not reappeared. no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron, who had placed himself at hand, though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway."
2174,1502-122615-0024.flac," has my friend found the moose. the young men's dagger under their burdens returned my guam. let read the bins go on the hunting path, he will meet them. a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name."
2175,1502-122615-0000.flac," poops ilyad. a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken. a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm, and the low voice of anka's muttered in his ear. the hurons or dogs."
2176,1502-122615-0034.flac," standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph, he turned away as a sickening at the gaze of men. inveiling his face and his blanket, he walked from the lodge with a noiseless step of an indian seeking."
2177,1502-122615-0035.flac," in the privacy of his own abode, the sympathy of one like himself, aged, fullorn, and childless. the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects and character."
2178,1502-122615-0026.flac, leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes.
2179,1502-122615-0009.flac," he walked into the lodge, and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirable with the deportment of his hosts. a hasty bit searching glance suffice to tell him that, though anka still remains where he had left him,"
2180,1502-122615-0037.flac, but who has ever found a cure on a sleep? the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed. the delaware's of the lakes?
2181,1502-122615-0007.flac," though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit, he produced no visible sensation. so far, the tear will seem that it just occurred."
2182,1502-122615-0017.flac, the huron was content with the assurance and resuming his pipe he waited the proper moment to move. the impatient hayward in really extra creating the cold customs of the savages.
2183,1502-122615-0031.flac, that we could chip or was cheated by squaw.
2184,1502-122615-0027.flac, the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth.
2185,1502-122615-0028.flac, suffer their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white headed savage.
2186,1502-122615-0005.flac," after this termination of the scene, duncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned and unnoticed, endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risky ran."
2187,1502-122615-0030.flac," then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence. it was a lie, he said. i had no son. he was called by that name as forgotten."
2188,1502-122615-0006.flac," he retraced his steps to the council lodge, resolved to seek in question david, in order to put it into his doubts. unreaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution,"
2189,103-1241-0041.flac," was enjoying himself. like most quiet folks, he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse."
2190,103-1241-0032.flac," but i do hope that someday i shall have a white dress. that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. i just love pretty clothes. and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember. but of course, it's all the more to look forward to isn't it. and then..."
2191,103-1241-0011.flac," i don't understand,"" said matthew, helplessly, wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation. ""'well, you'd better question the girl,' said the station-master carelessly. i dare say she'll be able to explain. she's got a tongue of her own, that's certain."""
2192,103-1241-0000.flac," chapter 2. matthew cuthbert is surprised. matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mayor jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river. it was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamie furwood to drive through."
2193,103-1241-0035.flac," and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots. i felt cheered up right away, and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might. i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. neither was mrs. spencer, although she generally is."
2194,103-1241-0034.flac," but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you? when we got on the train, i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. but i just went to work and imagine that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress, because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worthwhile."
2195,103-1241-0036.flac," she said she hadn't time to get sick, watching to see that i didn't fall overboard. she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about. but if it kept her from being seasick, it's a mercy i did prowl, isn't it? and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity."
2196,103-1241-0033.flac," i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously. this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this hard old, wincey dress. all the orphans had to wear them, you know. a merchant in hopes and last winter donated 300 yards of wincey to the asylum. some people said it was because he couldn't sell it."
2197,103-1241-0020.flac," i wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a while cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think? you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you?"
2198,103-1241-0002.flac," matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them. for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road, whether you know them or not. matthew dreaded all women except marilla and mrs. rachel."
2199,103-1241-0040.flac," there'd be no scope for the imagination then, with there. but am i talking too much? people are always telling me i do. would you rather i didn't talk? if you say so i'll stop. i can stop when i make up my mind to it, although it's difficult. matthew."
2200,103-1241-0009.flac," she's okay, i should say. i'm not expecting a girl,"" said matthew blankly. it's a boy i've come for. he should be here. mrs. alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me. the station master whistled."
2201,103-1241-0004.flac," and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty. in fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grain-ness. when he reached bright river, there was no sign of any train."
2202,103-1241-0019.flac, i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me tonight
2203,103-1241-0016.flac," might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced, that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity, that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive, that the forehead was broad and full. in short, our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded"
2204,103-1241-0027.flac," who had been stolen away from her parents and her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because i didn't have time in the day. i guess that's why i'm so thin. i am dreadful to an dine. there isn't a pick on my bones."
2205,103-1241-0030.flac," isn't that beautiful? what did that tree leaning out from the bank, all white and lacy make you think of, she asks? well now? i don't know. sit, matthew. why, a bride, of course, a bride all in white with a lovely, misty veil."
2206,103-1241-0037.flac," oh, there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom. this island is the bloomiest place. i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here. i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world."
2207,103-1241-0007.flac," and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main. matthew encountered the station-master locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the 530 train would soon be along."
2208,103-1241-0010.flac," guess there's some mistake, he said. mrs. spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge. said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum, and that you would be along for her presently. that's all i know about it, and i haven't got any more orphans concealed here about."
2209,103-1241-0017.flac," was so ludicrously afraid. matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first. for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her, she stood up, grasping with one thin brown hand, the handle of a shabby old-fashioned carpet bag, the other she held out to him."
2210,103-1241-0025.flac, it's worse than anything you can imagine. mrs. spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that.
2211,103-1241-0013.flac," and demanded her why she wasn't a boy. matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her. she had been watching him ever since he had passed her, and she had her eyes on him now. matthew was not looking at her."
2212,103-1241-0018.flac," i suppose you are mr. matthew cuthbert of green gables. she said in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice, i am very glad to see you. i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me."
2213,103-1241-0005.flac," he thought he was too early, so he tied his horse in the yard of the small, bright river hotel, and went over to the station house. the long platform was almost deserted, the only living creature inside being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end."
2214,103-1241-0026.flac," they were good, you know, the asylum people. but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum, only just in the other orphans. it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them."
2215,103-1241-0022.flac," no matter what mistake it had been made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables. i'm sorry i was late, he said shilmy. come along. the horse is over in the yard. give me your bag. oh, i can carry it, the child responded cheerfully."
2216,103-1241-0038.flac," and i used to imagine i was living here, but i never really expected i would. it's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it? but those red roads are so funny. when we got into the train at charlotte town in the red roads began to flash past, i asked mrs. spencer what made them red."
2217,103-1241-0029.flac, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads. the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy.
2218,103-1241-0023.flac," it isn't heavy. i've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy. and if it isn't carried in just a certain way, the handle pulls out, so i better keep it because i know the exact knack of it. it's an extremely old carpet bag. oh, i'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree."
2219,103-1241-0012.flac," maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted. he walked jauntly away, being hungry, and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that, which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den. walk up to a girl, a strange girl, an orphan girl."
2220,103-1241-0001.flac," or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filthy bloom. the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards, and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple, while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer and all the year."
2221,103-1241-0039.flac," and she said she didn't know him for pity's signal to ask her any more questions. she said i must have asked her a thousand already. i suppose i had too, but how are you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions? and what does make the roads red? well now? i don't know. sit, matthew."
2222,103-1241-0042.flac," he detested the way they had of sideling past him timidly with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to garble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word. that was the avenue type of well-bred little girl. but this record, which was very different."
2223,103-1241-0008.flac," the 530 train has been in and gone half an hour ago, answered that brisk official. but there was a passenger dropped off for you. a little girl. she's sitting out there on the shingles. i asked her to go into the lady's waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside."
2224,103-1241-0028.flac," i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows. with this, matthew's companions stop talking, partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill."
2225,103-1241-0014.flac," a child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very tight, very ugly dress of yellowish grey wincey. she wore a faded brown sailor hat, and beneath the hat, extending down her back, where two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair."
2226,103-1241-0015.flac," her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled. her mouth was large and sober her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods, and gray in others. so far the ordinary observer. an extraordinary observer."
2227,103-1241-0031.flac," i've never seen one, but i can imagine what she would look like. i don't ever expect to be a bride myself. i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me, unless it might be a foreign missionary. i suppose a foreign missionary might be very particular."
2228,103-1241-0003.flac," he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him. he may have been quite right in thinking so, for he was an odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure, and long, iron-gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders."
2229,103-1241-0021.flac, matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his. then and there he decided what to do. he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake. he would take her home and let marilla do that. she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow.
2230,103-1241-0043.flac, and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes.
2231,103-1241-0006.flac," matthew, barely noticing that it was a girl, sidled pastor as quickly as possible without looking at her. had he looked, he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody."
2232,103-1241-0024.flac," we've got to drive along peace, haven't we? mrs. spencer said it was eight miles. i'm glad because i love driving. oh, it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you. i've never belonged to anybody. not really. but the asylum was the worst. i've only been in it for four months, but that was enough."
2233,103-1240-0048.flac," this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla. she knitted steadily on. i don't deny there's something in what you say, rachel. i've had some qualms myself, but matthew was terrible set on it. i could see that, so i gave in."
2234,103-1240-0016.flac," yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. i'm clean puzzled, that's what, and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avenue today. accordingly, after tea mrs. rachel set out, she had not far to go."
2235,103-1240-0007.flac," anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road, and so run the unseen gauntlet of mrs. rachel's all-seeing eye. she was sitting there one afternoon in early june. the sun was coming in at the window, warm and bright."
2236,103-1240-0034.flac," she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her, but mrs. rachel was almost forced to suppose it. are you an earnest marilla? she demanded when voice returned to her. yes, of course."
2237,103-1240-0028.flac," yet what of matthew's white collar in the sorrel mare? mrs. rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet, unmisterious green gables. good evening, rachel. morilla said briskly. this is a real fine evening, isn't it? won't you sit down?"
2238,103-1240-0025.flac," once you got a glimpse of the bloom, white cherry trees in the left orchard, and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines. here sat marilla cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine."
2239,103-1240-0029.flac," how are all your folks? something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuffbert and mrs. rachel, in spite of, or perhaps because of, their dissimilarity. marilla was at all."
2240,103-1240-0033.flac," matthew went to bright river. we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia, and he's coming down the train tonight. if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia, mrs. rachel could not have been more astonished."
2241,103-1240-0017.flac," the big, rambling, orchard-emboward house where the cuthberts lived, was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynn's hollow. to be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further. matthew cuthberts' father, as shy and silent as his son after him,"
2242,103-1240-0051.flac," only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strickening in the well. i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that, and the whole family died in fearful agonies. only it was a girl in that instance. well, we're not getting a girl. timorilla."
2243,103-1240-0001.flac," that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place. it was reputed to be an intricate headlong broke in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade. but by the time it reached lynn's hollow, it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream."
2244,103-1240-0050.flac," and then nova scotia is right close to the island. it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states. he can't be much different from ourselves. well, i hope it will turn out all right,"" said mrs. rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts."
2245,103-1240-0020.flac," bordered with wild rose bushes. it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves. trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were, there'd be enough of them. i'd rather look at people. to be sure."
2246,103-1240-0044.flac," so matthew went to bright river to meet him. mrs. spencer will drop him off there. of course, she goes on to white sand station herself. mrs. rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind. she proceeded to speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news."
2247,103-1240-0055.flac," it does really seem as if i must be dreaming. well, i'm sorry for that poor young one, and no mistake. matthew and marulla don't know anything about children, and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather."
2248,103-1240-0022.flac," set about on one side with great patriarchal willows, and the other with prim lombardies. not a stray, stick-nor-stone was to be seen, former mrs. rachel would have seen it if there had been. privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house."
2249,103-1240-0027.flac," there were three plates laid, so that marilla must be expecting someone home with matthew to tea. but the dishes were everyday dishes, and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company."
2250,103-1240-0039.flac," so matthew and i have talked it over often on ever since. we thought we'd get a boy. matthew's getting up in years, you know. he's 60, and he isn't so spry as he once was. his heart troubles him a good deal, and you know how desperate hearted it's got to be to get hired help."
2251,103-1240-0042.flac," so in the end we decided to ask mrs. spencer to figure out one when she went over to get her little girl. we heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about 10 or 11. we decided that would be the best date."
2252,103-1240-0005.flac," helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church 8 society and foreign missions auxiliary. yet with all this, mrs. rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting cotton warp quilts. she had knitted 16 of them."
2253,103-1240-0013.flac," he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk. matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often. mrs. rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it."
2254,103-1240-0014.flac," and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled. i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why. the worthy woman finally concluded, he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits."
2255,103-1240-0015.flac, if he'd run out of turnip seat he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more.
2256,103-1240-0023.flac, one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt. mrs. rachel wrapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bitten to do so. the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment.
2257,103-1240-0052.flac," as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy. i'd never dreamed of taking a girl to bring up, i wondered mrs. alexander spencer for doing it, but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head."
2258,103-1240-0004.flac, but mrs. rachel lind was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. she was a notable housewife. her work was always done and well done. she ran the sewing circle.
2259,103-1240-0035.flac," said marilla, as if getting boys from orphaned silums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated avanly farm, instead of being an unheard of innovation. mrs. rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. she thought in exclamation points."
2260,103-1240-0036.flac," marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum. well, the world was certainly turning upside down. she would be surprised at nothing after this. nothing."
2261,103-1240-0010.flac," peter had asked him, of course, for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life. and yet, here was matthew cuthbert, at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day, massively driving over the hollow and up the hill."
2262,103-1240-0045.flac," well, marilla, i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing. a risky thing, that's what. you don't know what you're getting. you're bringing a strange child into your house and home, and you don't know a single thing about him, or what his disposition is like, nor what sort of parents he had."
2263,103-1240-0018.flac," had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he found it his homestead. green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land, and there it was to this day."
2264,103-1240-0011.flac," and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of avon lee. and he had the buggy and the soar all mayor, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance. now, where was matthew cuthbert going, and why was he going there?"
2265,103-1240-0026.flac," and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind her was laid for supper. mrs. rachel, before she had fairly closed the door,"
2266,103-1240-0032.flac," morilla's lips twitched, understandingly. she had expected mrs. rachel up. she had known that the sight of matthew, jaunting off so unaccountably, would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity. oh no, i'm quite well, although i had a bad headache yesterday, she said."
2267,103-1240-0056.flac," it seems uncanny to think of a child at greengables somehow. there's never been one there, for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built. if they ever were children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them, i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything."
2268,103-1240-0008.flac," the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridle flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees. thomas lind, a meek little man whom avonley people called rachel lynn's husband, was sowing his late turnip seed on the hillfield beyond the barn."
2269,103-1240-0006.flac," as heavenly housekeepers were want to tell in odd voices, and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow, and wound up the steep red hill beyond."
2270,103-1240-0053.flac," mrs. rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan. but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival, she concluded to go up the road to robert bells until the news. it would certainly make a sensation second to none."
2271,103-1240-0041.flac," they may be all right, i'm not saying they're not, but no london street arabs for me,"" i said. give me a native born at least. they'll be a risk no matter who we get. but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian."
2272,103-1240-0012.flac," had it been any other man in avonle, mrs. rachel, definitely putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions. but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him."
2273,103-1240-0037.flac," what on earth puts us a notion into your head? she demanded disapprovingly. this had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disproved. well, we've been thinking about it for some time. all winter, in fact, returned marilla."
2274,103-1240-0040.flac," there's never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little french boys. and as soon as you do get one broken to your ways and taught something, he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states. at first matthew suggested getting a homeboy, but i said no, flat to that."
2275,103-1240-0002.flac," for not even a brook could run past mrs. rachel linsdor without due regard for decency and decorum. it probably was conscious that mrs. rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up."
2276,103-1240-0009.flac," mrs. rachel knew that he ought, because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j. blair's store over at carmody, that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon."
2277,103-1240-0046.flac," nor how he's likely to turn out. why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man in his wife-up west of the island took a boy out of an orphanest island and he set fire to the house at night, set it on purpose, marilla, and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds."
2278,103-1240-0031.flac," but there was a savings something about her mouth, which, if it had been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor. ''we're all pretty well,'' said mrs. rachel. ''i was kind of afraid you weren't, though, when i saw matthew starting off today. i thought maybe he was going to the doctors.''"
2279,103-1240-0049.flac," it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in. and as for the risk, there's risks in pretty near everything that body does in this world. there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that. they don't always turn out well."
2280,103-1240-0057.flac," my, but i pity him. that's what. so said mrs. rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fullness of her heart."
2281,103-1240-0047.flac," and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs. they couldn't break him of it. if you had asked my advice in the matter, which you didn't do, marilla, i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what."
2282,103-1240-0024.flac," or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. its windows looked east and west. through the west one, looking out on the backyard, came a flood of mellow june sunlight. but the east one."
2283,103-1240-0054.flac," and mrs. rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. so she took herself away, somewhat to marilla's relief, for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of mrs. rachel's pessimism. while of all things that ever were or will be, ejaculated mrs. rachel when she was safely out in the lane."
2284,103-1240-0019.flac," barely visible from the main road along which all the other heavenly houses were so socially situated. mrs. rachel lind did not call living in such a place living at all. it's just staying. that's what she said, as she stepped along the deep-rutted grassy lane."
2285,103-1240-0030.flac," thin woman with angles and without curves. her dark hair showed some grey streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind, with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. she looked like a woman of narrow experience in rigid conscience, which she was."
2286,103-1240-0000.flac," chapter 1 mrs. rachel lind is surprised. mrs. rachel lind lived just where the avonly main road dipped down into a little hollow, rinsed with alders and ladies year drops and traversed by a brook."
2287,103-1240-0003.flac," and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place, she would never rest until she had ferreted out the wise and wear-forged thereof. there are plenty of people in avonli and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own."
2288,103-1240-0043.flac," old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off, and young enough to be trained up proper. we mean to give him a good home and schooling. we had a telegram from mrs. alexander spencer today, the mailman brought it from the station, saying they were coming on the 530 train tonight."
2289,103-1240-0038.flac, mrs. alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hoepton in the spring.
2290,103-1240-0021.flac," they seem contented enough, but then i suppose they're used to it. a body can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the irishman said. with this mrs. rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables. very green and neat and precise was that yard."
2291,311-124404-0091.flac, proceeding towards the brain. it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them to their proceed from the heart.
2292,311-124404-0079.flac," and if attention be given, it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart."
2293,311-124404-0097.flac," thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it diverse ideas, what must be understood by the common sense, senseless communists, in which these ideas are received by the memory which pertains them."
2294,311-124404-0029.flac, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described.
2295,311-124404-0119.flac, there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue.
2296,311-124404-0098.flac," by the fantasy which can change them in various ways, and out of them compose new ideas, and which, by the same means, distributing the animal spirit through the muscles, can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways."
2297,311-124404-0068.flac," the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels. but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted,"
2298,311-124404-0005.flac," and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these, we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering"
2299,311-124404-0053.flac," whereas the others, being round, are more conveniently closed with three. besides, i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture"
2300,311-124404-0116.flac, can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin. i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be it used from the power of matter.
2301,311-124404-0113.flac," since they are in doubt with many organs analogous to ours, they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows."
2302,311-124404-0066.flac," true reasons from mere very similitudes should venture. without examination to deny what has been said, i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily"
2303,311-124404-0104.flac," for example, if touched in a particular place, it may depend what we wish to say to it. if in another, it may cry out that it is hurt and such like."
2304,311-124404-0027.flac," and finally, how from these ashes?"
2305,311-124404-0034.flac," but since i had not yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as the rest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes and by showing"
2306,311-124404-0107.flac," that there are no men so dull and stupid, not even idiots, as to be incapable of joining together different words, and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood."
2307,311-124404-0103.flac, are thoughts to others. for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs.
2308,311-124404-0088.flac," which by being variously perforated, served to separate different species of grain. and in the last place, what above all is here worthy of observation."
2309,311-124404-0047.flac," where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and those of the tube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe enters, and the great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its branches all over the body."
2310,311-124404-0121.flac, because no other causes are observable of destroying it.
2311,311-124404-0014.flac, and assayed to represent it in such a matter that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul.

2397,4788-94904-0001.flac," that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them, though this is not true universally. for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity."
2398,4788-94904-0017.flac," the country is distracted by mere struggles for place. if strong, it makes itself despotic, at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives, or such of them as are capable of giving trouble, by a share of the spoil."

2402,4788-94904-0014.flac, these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government. the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution.

2424,4788-94904-0000.flac, we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement. as they range lower and lower in development
2425,4788-94904-0005.flac," they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at. when opinion is really adverse, its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself."
2426,4788-94904-0038.flac," and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally, rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation. in this manner, a central power, despotic in principle,"
2427,4788-94904-0006.flac," the contrary case is not indeed unexampled. there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers, but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be."

2431,4788-294466-0020.flac," i do believe mr. harvey has a letter for us, store, i said. the old man had shuffled into the dark well of his store, a moment later he reappeared with several letters and a newspaper. good."
2432,4788-294466-0010.flac," and jerry's mother taught a little desert school over near the newcomme ranch. she didn't teach long, though, for that very first vacation she married jerry's cowboy father. after that, mother and mrs. newcomme were good friends, naturally, being brides and neighbors."
2433,4788-294466-0014.flac," noticing the door was deep in thought, she asked lightly. won't you say it out loud? why, of course, i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loons rock house. because he had to do the milking, mary replied simply."
2434,4788-294466-0021.flac," dora exclaimed as she rode close to the porch. thanks a lot, she called brightly up to the old man, who was handing the packet down over the sagging wooden rail. his friendly toothless smile was directed at the smaller girl."
2435,4788-294466-0012.flac, far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border. the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters. the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them.
2436,4788-294466-0026.flac, you wait until dick has been on the desert long enough to get a coat of tan. he may surprise you.
2437,4788-294466-0006.flac," they're nice boys, aren't they, mary said. i've always wished i had a brother, and i do believe jerry is going to be just like one."" a loud door replied, i have noticed that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought."
2438,4788-294466-0031.flac," then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom, she asked eagerly. may i tell dad an adventure we've had? mrs. farley, middle-aged, kind-faced. shook her head, smiling down at the girl. not tonight, please. won't tomorrow do?"
2439,4788-294466-0000.flac," mary's nettlesome brown pony was hard to quiet until jerry reached out a strong brown hand and patted its head mary lifted startled blue eyes jerry, what do you make of that? she asked"
2440,4788-294466-0023.flac," palefeller with specs on his son, 80. yes, mr. harvey, dick is mrs. farley's son. mary took time in a friendly way to satisfy the old man's curiosity."
2441,4788-294466-0009.flac," when she spoke, she said, it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister. our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides. i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have. my mother met dad in bizby where he was a mining engineer."
2442,4788-294466-0004.flac," she smiled at her friend. mary, not wishing to appear foolishly timid, said, in his courageous voice as she could muster. of course, we're not afraid. goodbye, boys. we'll see you tomorrow."
2443,4788-294466-0005.flac," feeling assured that the girls were alright, the boys went at a gallop down the road and across the desert valley to the new comb ranch."
2444,4788-294466-0028.flac," a bright black-eyed mexican boy of about ten ran out to the road as the girls approached. come on, emanuel. mary sang down to him. you may put up our horses and earn a dime. the small boy's white teeth flashed in a delighted grin."
2445,4788-294466-0017.flac," i'm crazy about mysteries, as you know, and if there really is one about that rock house, i want to try to solve it."" she said no more about it just then, as they had reached the old ghost town of gleason."
2446,4788-294466-0024.flac, dick has been going to the arizona state university this winter to be near his mother. she's a widow and he's her only son. her husband was a doctor and they lived back in boston before he died. do tell! the old man wagged his head sympathetically.
2447,4788-294466-0030.flac," it's broad porch and adobe pillars. here her mother had come as a bride. here mary had been born. eight happy years they had spent together before her mother died. after mary had been taken east to school, her father had returned."
2448,4788-294466-0002.flac," he must have been dead for years if he was old when jerry's father was a boy. of course, dora lesson climbed to be imaginative replied, then to the cowboy she said in her practical matter of fact way,"
2449,4788-294466-0007.flac," oh, mary, how blind you are. dreamily, the younger girl was saying, that's because we were playmates when we were little so very long ago. oh, my, how ancient we are, dora said teasingly."
2450,4788-294466-0027.flac," some with broken windows and doors, others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls. the only sign of life was in three small adobies where poor mexican families lived. broken windows in two of the houses were stuffed with brags."
2451,4788-294466-0018.flac," in the long ago days when the town had been teeming with life, picturesque looking minors and ranchers had sat there tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns. today the chairs were empty. an old man shriveled."
2452,4788-294466-0022.flac," he said, miss farley, your nursewoman, came down to mail some letters of spell back. then before mary could reply, he continued in his shrill, wavering voice."
2453,4788-294466-0013.flac," it was very still, not a sound was to be heard, now and then a rabbit darted past silently. how peaceful this hour is on the desert, mary began glancing at her friend, who was riding so close at her side."
2454,4788-294466-0016.flac," i don't believe he will tell us about that. i acted so like a scarecat all the time we were there, he won't ever take us there again, and he probably won't tell us the story either. then i'll find it out some other way, dorrard declared."
2455,4788-294466-0025.flac," bustin' brock's? mary smiled in appreciation of the old man's joke. no, jerry won't expect dick to do that right at first. he's official fence-mender just at present. dorah defended the absent boy. mr. harvey."
2456,4788-294466-0029.flac," his brown feet raced so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square two-story to dobie near the mountains, a manual was there to lead their horses around back. mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flower-edged walk."
2457,4788-294466-0008.flac," please remember that you are only one year younger than i am and i refuse to be called elderly. mary smiled, thankly, but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist, a wonderfully pretty, wistful little girl."
2458,4788-294466-0019.flac," grey bearded, unkempt, but with kind grey eyes, deep sunken under shaggy brows stood in the open door. he smiled out at them in a friendly way, then beckoned with a bony finger."
2459,4788-294466-0001.flac," we couldn't have imagined that gunshot and surely the horses heard it also. jerry smiles reassuring. it was the story that frightened you girls i reckon he said, glancing about and up and down the road as he spoke."
2460,4788-294466-0003.flac," hurry along home to your milking, jerry, and dick don't you bother to come with us. now that you're working on the new com ranch, you ought to be there. it's only a few miles up over this sunshine he wrote to gleason. we aren't the least bit afraid to ride home alone. are we?"
2461,4788-294466-0015.flac," dora nodded. so he said, then she hastened to add, oh, don't think i'm inferring the jerry told an untruth, but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glant's stop startled. dora belman, she said."
2462,4788-91208-0034.flac," and all his relations to his fellow creatures, the very birds about his dwelling seemed to recognize it. it is this noble sentiment which infuses a soul of life into his teachings and the enunciation and acting out of which constitute him."

2467,4788-91208-0033.flac, never has the libel of humanity involved in the current theology been more forcibly pointed out with its constant appeal to low motives of personal gain.
2468,4788-91208-0032.flac, and we join with him in condemning as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange and eternity a personal enjoyment.
2469,4788-91208-0031.flac, this religion of the infidel cannot in honesty and conscience be called an intrinsically bad one. many indeed may be unable to believe that this object is capable of gathering around it feeling sufficiently strong.

2471,4788-91208-0026.flac," as mr. mills says, the name of god is veiled under two extremely abstract phrases, the infinite and the absolute. so profound and friendly are thinker as the late mr. grote held this raising of the veil in expedient, but he proved..."
2472,4788-91208-0025.flac," in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy, mr. mill gives battle to this mode of thought. after reviewing, in an opening chapter, the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge,"

2475,4788-91208-0019.flac," and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin. it was this, taken with his theory of the syllogism, which worked the great change. both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy."

2478,4788-91208-0022.flac," the biggest line in the path was the doctrine of so-called necessary truth. this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him, as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth, and a standard, as he was easily able to show,"
2479,4788-91208-0013.flac," was but imperfectly realized, and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of. mr. mill altered all this. he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars, nor from particulars to generals, but from particulars to particulars."
2480,4788-91208-0015.flac," the mortality of john, thomas, and others is, after all, the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the duke of wellington. not one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a general proposition."
2481,4788-91208-0010.flac," incapable of being proved from other propositions, it followed that if they were known to us at all, they must be original data of consciousness. here was a perfect paradise of question begging. the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed"
2482,4788-91208-0016.flac," we not only may, according to mr. mill, reason from some particular instances to others, but we frequently do so. as however, the instances which are sufficient to prove one fresh instance..."
2483,4788-91208-0018.flac, all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive. inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic. and to induction accordingly mr. mill devoted his chief attention. for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic.
2484,4788-91208-0003.flac," mr. mills' achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either. whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society, he is..."

2496,4788-91208-0021.flac," the perfection of his method, its application and the uprooting of prejudices which stood in its way, this was the task to which mr. mill applied himself, with an ability and success rarely matched and never surpassed."

2556,2989-138035-0018.flac," one would be for choosing her father servant, and another, someone she has seen passing in the street and fans his gallant and dashing, though he may be a drunken bully."
2557,2989-138035-0030.flac," maybe there are toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk. that is true, so the licensiate. for those who have been bred up in the tanneries."

2587,2989-138028-0025.flac," for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants, and even should we find one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. of plebeian lineages, i have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live."
2588,2989-138028-0028.flac," even though he know him not, will fail to recognize and set him down as one of good blood. and it would be strange where it not so. praise has ever been the reward of virtue, and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation."
2589,2989-138028-0009.flac," whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him, whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing about. but i do."
2590,2989-138028-0033.flac," i know, as a great castilian poet says, that it is by rugged paths like these they go that scale the heights of immortality, unreach by those that falter here below."

2594,2989-138028-0003.flac," and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him. were upon the housekeeper said, tell us in your, at his majesty's court, are there no knights? there are, replied don quixote and plenty of them, and it is right there should be."
2595,2989-138028-0073.flac, samson's intention in persuading him to sell a fourth once more was to do what the history relates further on.
2596,2989-138028-0074.flac, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.

2598,2989-138028-0006.flac," there is a great difference between one and another. for the courtiers, without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court, range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst."
2599,2989-138028-0055.flac," and in short, i mean to say, and i do say, that if you don't like to come on reward with me, and run the same chance that i run, gop you with you."
2600,2989-138028-0010.flac," and you must know besides that the true knight aren't, though he may see ten giants, then not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them, and then go each of them on two tall towers by way of legs, and whose arms are like the mass of mighty ships, and each eye like a great millwheel."
2601,2989-138028-0034.flac," i can tell you knees for plied donkey hoete if these chivalrous thoughts do not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that i could not do. no any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands, particularly cages and toothpicks."
2602,2989-138028-0007.flac," but we, the true knight's errand, measure the whole earth with our own feet, exposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclementes of heaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback."
2603,2989-138028-0039.flac," say the prayer of santa apollonia, that is if you know it, for i will come presently and you will see miracles. what was me? cread the housekeeper."
2604,2989-138028-0045.flac, for i know not what i am so full-sile means.
2605,2989-138028-0000.flac," chapter 6. of what took place between donkey hote and his niece and housekeeper, one of the most important chapters in the whole history."
2606,2989-138028-0002.flac," what answer god will give to your complaints, housekeeper, i know not, nor what his majesty will answer either. i only know that if i were king, i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions that present every day."
2607,2989-138028-0075.flac, his affore is furnished with certain matters in the way of victuels and is purse with money that donkey hote gave him to meet emergencies. samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former.
2608,2989-138028-0038.flac," that i can well believe replied the bachelor, for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for another, so they were to burst for it. in short then, mr. housekeeper, that is all."
2609,2989-138028-0047.flac," but to come to the point, what does teresa say? teresa says"
2610,2989-138028-0044.flac," once or twice, as well as i remember replay sancio."
2611,2989-138028-0035.flac," at this moment, they came knocking at the door."
2612,2989-138028-0011.flac," and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them. on the contrary, he must attack and fall upon them with a gallon bearing and appear this heart, and if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even though they have, for armor, the shells of a certain fish."
2613,2989-138028-0041.flac," i know what i'm saying, mr. telskipper."
2614,2989-138028-0029.flac," there are two roads my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honors. one is that of letters, the other that of arms."
2615,2989-138028-0040.flac, that would do if it was the two thick my master head.
2616,2989-138028-0059.flac, any longer curved and checked. for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs.
2617,2989-138028-0031.flac," and it will be labor and vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and above all my own inclination favors. for knowing us as i do the countless toils that are the accompanies of night air entry."
2618,2989-138028-0027.flac," but above all by being charitable. for by two marvetti's given with a cheerful heart to the poor, he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing. and no one that perceives him to be in doubt with the virtues i have named."
2619,2989-138028-0030.flac, i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road.
2620,2989-138028-0063.flac," let this new samson remain in his own country, and bring honor to it, bring honor at the same time on the grey heads of the venerable parents, for i will be content with any square that comes to hand asanjo does not deen to accompany me."
2621,2989-138028-0032.flac," i know, too, the infinite blessings that are attained by it. i know that the path of virtue is very narrow, and the road of vice broad and spacious, i know their ends and goals are different. for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death."
2622,2989-138028-0072.flac," poured out on the bachelor, were past counting. they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion."
2623,2989-138028-0024.flac," of countless princes, monarchs, lords, maids, assyrians, persians, greeks, and barbarians. all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing."
2624,2989-138028-0016.flac," but some there are that might have heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case, for they are not all courteous or manally, some are ill-conditioned scoundrels, nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects. some are gold, others pinch back."
2625,2989-138028-0052.flac," and so well understood, returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with account in the shafts of thy proverbs."
2626,2989-138028-0053.flac," please to return to my service well and good, but to suppose that i am going to disturb or enhance the ancient usage of night air entry, it is all nonsense. and so my sancio, get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your teresa."
2627,2989-138028-0018.flac," god bless me, said denise, that you should know so much, uncle."
2628,2989-138028-0023.flac," for example, the second sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintained it still without adding to it."
2629,2989-138028-0004.flac," to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the king's majesty. then might not your worship, said she, be one of those that, without stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court."
2630,2989-138028-0020.flac," all the lineages in the world, attend to what i'm saying, can be reduced to four sorts, which are these. those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they had attained surpassing greatness, those that had great beginnings and maintained them,"
2631,2989-138028-0069.flac," as he was there described, but now hearing him talk of a will and coddisil that could not be provoked. instead of will and coddisil that could not be revoked."
2632,2989-138028-0065.flac," who the punses from whom i am descended were, and what is more i know and have learned."
2633,2989-138028-0057.flac," may god almighty and his infinite power grant that any person or persons who would impede or hinder thy third sally may find no way out of the leberands of their schemes, no ever accomplish what they most desire, and then turning to the housekeeper, he said."
2634,2989-138028-0056.flac," the archwag samson came forward and embracing him is he had done before, set with a loud voice. o flower of night-errantry, o shining light of arms, o honor and mirror of this mannished nation!"
2635,2989-138028-0014.flac, i wouldn't flick the chastisement upon me for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with. what can it be the young hussie that hardly knows how to handle a dozen laced bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticize the histories of knight's errant?
2636,2989-138028-0017.flac, and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen.
2637,2989-138028-0015.flac, for he was the most humble-minded and courteous night of his time.
2638,2989-138028-0068.flac," so i offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that served nice errands in times past or present."
2639,2989-138028-0049.flac," and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased to give him."
2640,2989-138028-0036.flac," nothing, senora samson said she, only that my master is breaking out, plainly breaking out. what about since he breaking out senora? as samson, has any part of his body burst? he's only breaking out at the door of his madness, she replied."
2641,2989-138028-0021.flac," and still maintaining uphold the greatness of their origin. those, again, that from a great beginning have ended an appointment like a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatness."
2642,2989-138028-0022.flac, those that had a humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve.
2643,2989-138028-0008.flac," nor do we only know the enemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes. and at all risks, and on all occasions, we attack them. without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lens or sword,"
2644,2989-138028-0046.flac," and submit to what i teach thee. i would bet, sid'sancho, that from the very first you understood me, i knew what i meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders. maybe so, reply donkey hote."
2645,2989-138028-0019.flac," and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old. strong, when you are sickly, able to put straight wood as crooked when you yourself are bent by age. and above all, a cuba-yero when you are not one."
2646,2989-138028-0066.flac," no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants. but, after all, a man must be a man and a woman a woman, and as i am a man anyhow, which i can't deny, i will be one in my own house too, let who will take it a miss."
2647,2989-138028-0013.flac," and it would be well if there were no prints who did not set a higher value on the second, or more properly speaking, first, kind of night, errant. for, as we read in their histories,"
2648,2989-138028-0042.flac, replied carasco and with this the housekeeper retired.
2649,2989-138028-0054.flac," viniqued him. but if not, we remain friends. for if the pigeon house does not lack food, it will not like pigeons. and bear in mind my son, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation."
2650,2989-138028-0058.flac," but i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that sanyo adonkiyote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs, and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience that i not urge and persuade this knight not to keep them might if his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit."
2651,2989-138028-0070.flac," and fine, donkey hote and sancio embraced one another and made friends. and by the advice, and with the approval of the great carasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days then, by which time they could have..."

2655,7113-86041-0026.flac," running hither and dither and high glee, and calling merrily to each other. at last, when they were quite wary, the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would contend her but to bathe in the marble pool."
2656,7113-86041-0042.flac, who is there i can find for her to talk to?
2657,7113-86041-0009.flac," but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful, and rubazzle soon left him and went to be shepherded to his next neighbor."
2658,7113-86041-0023.flac," as the wandering breeze scattered it. daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink, while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round, making the sweetest and daintiest bowler imaginable."
2659,7113-86041-0085.flac, unless he could be forever chattering.
2660,7113-86041-0002.flac," for a basil loved all pretty things. sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions, and come out upon the green earth for a while, and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing."
2661,7113-86041-0079.flac," caught him in her cruel beak, and before he could say a word, he had disappeared down her throat. these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more."
2662,7113-86041-0055.flac," to take part in the games of the princess, to that last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows. she shuddered."
2663,7113-86041-0043.flac," carrots, turnips, and radishes, and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess, who set pensive in the shade of the rose-bower. loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome, banish all sorrow."
2664,7113-86041-0022.flac," the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster. the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed, float in silence, now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt."
2665,7113-86041-0033.flac," the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princesses' play-fellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance. but as they only repeated the same story, he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some..."
2666,7113-86041-0045.flac," take this little mini, colored wand, and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see. with this, he left her, and the princess without an instance delay. open the basket."
2667,7113-86041-0086.flac," all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment, and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess. but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learned, so he soon fluttered away."
2668,7113-86041-0059.flac," sweetest and fairest of damsels, cry the gnome. do not be angry, everything that is in my power i will do. but do not ask the impossible, so long as the sap was fresh in the roots."
2669,7113-86041-0048.flac," the gnome had given to his hoped for bride. there they found so much to amuse them, that the hours passed like minutes. fails, girdles, and necklaces were tried on and admired."
2670,7113-86041-0006.flac," came the music of the shepherd's pipe. the strangeness and the pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests, who without saying, by your leave or with your leave,"
2671,7113-86041-0093.flac," and yet i am fearful. a wife cannot always charm, and though you will never alter. the beauty of mortals is as flower that fades. how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now?"
2672,7113-86041-0017.flac," when he understood this, he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket, and took the form of a handsome young man. that was the best way. and he fell in love with a girl, then, and there."
2673,7113-86041-0065.flac," dear queen of my heart, answered he, i pray you to forgive my carelessness. i promised more than i could perform. i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire, but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty-sellers."
2674,7113-86041-0062.flac," and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women, and left them the withered roots they really were, to be thrown upon the rubbish heap, and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow."
2675,7113-86041-0110.flac, to the depths of his underground kingdom.
2676,7113-86041-0077.flac," then and there. after that, by the power of the wonderful wand, she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting. hopped little cricket to radabor, in chirp in his ear that i love him only."
2677,7113-86041-0103.flac," but without success. then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room, peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name, but only..."
2678,7113-86041-0100.flac," into the arms of her beloved prince radabor. meanwhile, the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again to his back ache and his head swam, and he could no longer put two and two together."
2679,7113-86041-0082.flac," now prince radabor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods, and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief. one day, as he sat in the shade of an oak tree, dreaming of his lost princess, and sometimes crying her name aloud,"
2680,7113-86041-0088.flac," she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference. indeed, there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might someday return his love. and the idea pleased him mightily. the next day..."
2681,7113-86041-0091.flac," your constancy has overcome me,"" she said. i can no longer oppose your wishes, but believe my words and suffer this fail still to hide my blushes and tears. why tears, beloved one, cry the gnome anxiously?"
2682,7113-86041-0078.flac," but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains. so the cricket hopped off gaeli determined to do his best to deliver his message, but alas, a long-legged stork who was prancing along the same road."
2683,7113-86041-0012.flac," down to his underground palace, very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind. but as time went on, he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him, and thought he would take another look at the upper world."
2684,7113-86041-0054.flac," while brunelda and the rest faded visibly. they assured her that all was well with them, but nevertheless, they continued to waste away."
2685,7113-86041-0029.flac," but which had swallowed up the princess before their eyes, they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her, but in vain. they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool and could not keep under water for a second."
2686,7113-86041-0041.flac," and in a thousand waves strove to dispel the cloud, but in vain. at last he set to himself. men are sociable creatures, like bees or ants."
2687,7113-86041-0076.flac," so the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bitten. but before he was out of sight, a greedy swallow made a snatch at him. and to the great grief of the princess, her messenger was eaten up."
2688,7113-86041-0090.flac," and her flowing veils sparkled with gems. in these magnificent garments, she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace. loveliest of maidens, he stammered, bowing low before her. let me gaze into your dear eyes."
2689,7113-86041-0000.flac," rubazzle. over all the fast underworld, the mountain-nome rubazzle was lured, and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him. there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through."
2690,7113-86041-0074.flac," for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter had now come to their full size. day by day, the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them, conjuring up now this longed-for person and now that."
2691,7113-86041-0080.flac," this time she changed the turnip into a magpie. flutter from tree to tree, chattering bird said she. till you come to radabor my love."
2692,7113-86041-0001.flac," and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks. some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapors to change dull stones to precious metal, or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies."
2693,7113-86041-0060.flac," the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired. but as the sap dried up, they withered away. but never trouble yourself about that dearest one. a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right."
2694,7113-86041-0005.flac," and in their place appeared blossoming orchards, surrounded cozy looking, thatched cottages. for every chivney, the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air. sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows."
2695,7113-86041-0013.flac," where studded charming maiden, fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon. around her upon the grass lay her young companions, as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game."
2696,7113-86041-0073.flac," in her own mind she was wandering, if by any means she might escape from her captivity, and at last she hit upon a plan. by this time spring once more reigned in the valley, and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth."
2697,7113-86041-0039.flac," hen nightingale sang in every bush as the gnome in the princess wandered in the leafy alleys, sometimes gazing at the moon, sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her dormant."
2698,7113-86041-0098.flac," pretty looks and words. as for the maiden, no sooner was her diluted lover fairly out of sight. then she began to prepare for flight. she had a fine, fresh turnip hidden close at hand."
2699,7113-86041-0064.flac," by the trulless of grapevine, she met the gnome, who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off."
2700,7113-86041-0018.flac," the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country, and she often wandered in the forest with her playfellows, gathering the wild flowers and fruits. till the midday he drove the merry band to the shady lawn."
2701,7113-86041-0024.flac," were spread out strange fruits and sweet meats, the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them. she hesitated a while, however, scarcely able to believe her eyes."
2702,7113-86041-0032.flac," the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished, and so had the marble bath. the bower of jasmine, instead, all was a tangle of flowers, as it had been of old."
2703,7113-86041-0019.flac," by the brook to rest, or to bathe in the cool waters. on this particular morning, the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood. this!"
2704,7113-86041-0028.flac," and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair. loudly did they weep and whale running about the brink of the pool, which looked so shallow and so clear."
2705,7113-86041-0057.flac," lay the once frolic some-benny, with all four feet stretched stiffly out, while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion. the horrified princess fled to the door."
2706,7113-86041-0040.flac," but the princess felt no such happiness, in spite of all the magic delights around her, she was sad. though she tried to seem content for fear of displacing the gnome, however, he soon perceived her melancholy."
2707,7113-86041-0068.flac," and disguising himself as a farmer, bought an ass in the nearest market town, and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip, carrot, and radish seed. with this he sowed a great field."
2708,7113-86041-0051.flac," she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand, and soon had all her maidens about her. and even as she had two tiny radishes to spare,"
2709,7113-86041-0097.flac," this time, to his great annoyance, the number was different, so he reckoned them for the third time. but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones, and this was hardly to be wondered at, as his mind was full of the princesses."
2710,7113-86041-0053.flac," they played from morning to night, only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and won. and the mayor and the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom."
2711,7113-86041-0094.flac," ask some proof, sweetheart,"" said he, pupmy obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love. be it so, answered the crafty maiden, then give me..."
2712,7113-86041-0038.flac," on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay, sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady, which pleased the eye of the princess. the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples."
2713,7113-86041-0104.flac," echo answered in the marble halls, there was neither voice nor footsteps. then he began to perceive that something was amiss, and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him, he flew out of the palace."
2714,7113-86041-0010.flac," and where among the hills to look for any who straight away, that they too prospered under his care, and not one was lost or torn by wolves. but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well-earned wages."
2715,7113-86041-0084.flac, but the magpie in the tree who like
2716,7113-86041-0075.flac," just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared. but she really had another purpose in view. one day, she changed a tiny turnip into a bee, and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover. fly."
2717,7113-86041-0087.flac," while the prince hurried back to his castle together together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall. the princess, meanwhile, was craftily pursuing her plan of escape."
2718,7113-86041-0035.flac," they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her fathers seemed about a poor cottage in comparison with it. and when she recovered from her astonishment, she found herself seated upon a couch."
2719,7113-86041-0044.flac, no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling.
2720,7113-86041-0070.flac," he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him. but that was a mistake, for the truth was that another image already filled her heart. the young prince ratabor, whose lands joined her fathers, had won the heart of the princess,"
2721,7113-86041-0021.flac," weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed. and when the maidens returned at noon to their favorite resting place, they stood lost in amazement and almost fancy that they must be dreaming."
2722,7113-86041-0034.flac," sprite or goblin, and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt. for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long. meanwhile, the princess was not at all unhappy."
2723,7113-86041-0008.flac," he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man. so taking the form of an old field laborer, he entered the service of a farmer. under his care, all the crops flourished exceedingly."
2724,7113-86041-0016.flac, he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels. and a nest of field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens.
2725,7113-86041-0109.flac," and the foresake in noem resolved, but he would have no more tealings with such false creatures."
2726,7113-86041-0015.flac, the sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company. he changed himself into a raven
2727,7113-86041-0069.flac," and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch intended, and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth, near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds. thus fostered, they grew and flourished marvelously."
2728,7113-86041-0036.flac," wrapped in a wonderful robe satan, fastened with a silken girdle, while beside her knelt a young man who whispered sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear. the gnome, for he was, told her all about himself."
2729,7113-86041-0037.flac," and his great underground kingdom, and presently led her through the many rooms in halls of the palace, and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them, till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendor."
2730,7113-86041-0049.flac, and showed so much taste that nobody.
2731,7113-86041-0108.flac," he passed through the gardens, which for him had lost their charm, and the sight of the princesses' footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief. always lonely, empty, sorrowful."
2732,7113-86041-0007.flac," nor did he wish to interfere with their doings, but left them in quiet possession of their homes. as a good householder leaves in peace, the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves."
2733,7113-86041-0107.flac," and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair, be wailing to the four winds his unhappy fate, went sorrowfully back to the palace, and stole once more through every room with many size and limitations."
2734,7113-86041-0052.flac," whose name was benny. and now all went cheerfully in the castle. the princess gave to each of the maidens her task, and never was mistress better served. for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed."
2735,7113-86041-0096.flac," he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper, and had soon counted them all. but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake, he thought he would just run over them again."
2736,7113-86041-0067.flac," and then without fail, you shall have your puppets to play with. almost before the gnome had finished, the disappointed princess turned away, and marched off to her own apartments without daining to answer him. the gnome, however."
2737,7113-86041-0083.flac," which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him, and his memory forever. therapan, he caught up a great stone."
2738,7113-86041-0081.flac," and bid him come with horses and men, the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley. the magpie listened, hopped a while from branch to branch, and then darted away."
2739,7113-86041-0046.flac," the sudden appearance was so deflightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes, and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more. hand in hand, they wandered about the enchanted garden."
2740,7113-86041-0095.flac," that shall be the test of your truth towards me."" unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment, he obeyed her commands without delay, and hurried off to begin his task."
2741,7113-86041-0011.flac," so he ran away and went to serve the judge. here he upheld the law with might and mane, and was a tear to thieves and evil doers. but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law."
2742,7113-86041-0099.flac," which she changed into a spirited horse, all saddled and bridled, and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill, and dale, till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself."
2743,7113-86041-0027.flac," which certainly did look very inviting. and they all went galeed to this new amusement. the princess was ready first, but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down, down, down she sank."
2744,7113-86041-0004.flac," to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills. but the next time he ventured above ground, what was his surprise to find everything changed. the dark woods were huge down."
2745,7113-86041-0025.flac," but at length curiosity prevailed, and she and her companions explored to their hearts content."
2746,7113-86041-0050.flac," the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman, and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before."
2747,7113-86041-0056.flac," and started back at the sight of a group of shriveled crones, with bent backs and trembling limbs, who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches, and coughed dismally. a little nearer to the hearth."
2748,7113-86041-0106.flac, and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years. but his fury was vain. the thunder clouds melted away into a soft mist.
2749,7113-86041-0102.flac," as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her. but, alas, she was no longer there. he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree engaged into every pond."
2750,7113-86041-0063.flac," to take possession of the freshly filled basket. but to her surprise, she could not find it anywhere. up and down the garden she searched, spying into every corner, but not a sign of it was to be found."
2751,5390-24512-0042.flac, is the middle of all the words.
2752,5390-24512-0007.flac, to crucify jesus of nazareth and to free barabas. but in choosing the rebel barabas...
2753,5390-24512-0022.flac," ""'ahh, my countrymen,' he cried. we did nothing without god in the past, but now you are fighting against him.' had god judged you worthy of freedom, he would have punished the romans as he did the assyrians long ago."
2754,5390-24512-0049.flac," just so was it with the hebrew copies of god's word, locked up in a dead language, kept close away from the world. they were like the jar of wheat which could not grow."
2755,5390-24512-0016.flac," and he sent a great army against jerusalem. the jews shot the gates of their city and so began the awful siege of jerusalem. and when he shall siege jerusalem, compassed with armies,"
2756,5390-24512-0032.flac," over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often, and beside whose shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy. a great and beautiful college it was with broad, terrorist gardens."
2757,5390-24512-0036.flac," before you copy a single word, you must wash your body all over and clothe yourself in full jewish dress, preparing your mind with solemn thoughts. the parchment you write upon must be made from the skins of clean animals only."
2758,5390-24512-0040.flac," that copy must be destroyed. not satisfied with all these directions, the master taught his scholar to count the letters of every book."
2759,5390-24512-0019.flac," that mothers even snatched the bread from their own children's mouths. look over the walls, o people of jerusalem. the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken, and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide."
2760,5390-24512-0000.flac," for although the jewish family of the herds reigned over judea, they only held their throne under the roman emperor. this the jews could not endure. they longed to be a free and independent nation once again."
2761,5390-24512-0026.flac," and the golden candlestick, and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen rome. alas, for the holy city, over which the savior of the world had stood and wept forty years before."
2762,5390-24512-0027.flac, knowing the suffering that lay before her. these jews are dangerous. we must not allow them to rebuild their city or to become a separate people again as a nation they must cease to exist.
2763,5390-24512-0020.flac," hard, merciless as was the roman general, even he grew sick with horror at last, and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews, promising them their lives if they would give up the city."
2764,5390-24512-0014.flac," the romans believed them, and opened their gates, but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob, than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man. as they died, the roman soldiers, whom not even death could terrify,"
2765,5390-24512-0024.flac," which still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine, or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sunbeams struck full on its golden roof. then redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof."
2766,5390-24512-0037.flac," that is clean according to the law of moses. the ink you write with must be of a pure black, made only from a mixture of sut, charcoal and honey."
2767,5390-24512-0017.flac," he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem, and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city. his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within."
2768,5390-24512-0033.flac," so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible. as we have seen, the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god just as it stood. they had begun even in our lord's day."
2769,5390-24512-0031.flac, they allowed the jewish teachers to continue the synagogue services in other parts of palestine and to teach in their colleges. the most famous jewish college of these days was at tiberius on the shores of the sea of galilee.
2770,5390-24512-0038.flac," though you know the whole book of the law by heart, you must not write a single word from memory, but raise your eyes to your copy and pronounce the word aloud before trusting it to your pen."
2771,5390-24512-0030.flac, the jews were now no longer a nation. they had become merely a body of people led by their rabbis or teachers of the law. but they were still the people of the book.
2772,5390-24512-0045.flac, and the breadth of each column had to be thirty letters wide. there are eleven verses in the book of the law beginning and ending with n. there are forty verses in which law is read three times and so on and so on.
2773,5390-24512-0041.flac, is the middle letter of all the five books of moses.
2774,5390-24512-0013.flac," where the roman soldiers were quartered, and cried out to the garrison within that their lives should be spared if they would lay down their weapons. the roman soldiers hesitated, but the jews promised most faithfully to keep their word."
2775,5390-24512-0029.flac," exactly as the lord foretold. there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found, but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers, and is the property of the turkish nation."
2776,5390-24512-0010.flac," yet the keen are the suffering, the more desperate the jews became. their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge."
2777,5390-24512-0006.flac," had not the jews prevented it. if thou let this man go, thou art not caesar's friend, they cried."
2778,5390-24512-0047.flac," nor for this purpose had god revealed his will to man. some years ago, in the coffin of an egyptian mummy, a little jar of wheat was found. for thousands of years it had lain there, shut up in the dark."
2779,5390-24512-0018.flac," as one by one their defenses fell, and the end drew near. then food failed in the city, men fought like demons in the streets for a tiny loaf of barley bread, so frantic were the people with hunger."
2780,5390-24512-0035.flac," yet although they heated so little the true meaning of god's book, they guarded its words more and more carefully, and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict indeed. my son and old teacher would say to his pupil."
2781,5390-24512-0028.flac," so, the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed, and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own. they have indeed been led away captive into all nations."
2782,5390-24512-0048.flac," while out in the fields, the corn which had been sown had grown up and been reaped every year, and men and women had been fed. but this jar of corn was useless, because it had been prevented from doing the work in the world for which it was created."
2783,5390-24512-0043.flac," is the very center of all the verses. the letter a, that is, the hebrew letter which stands for a, occurs 42,377 times. the letter b, 35,218."
2784,5390-24512-0005.flac, the roman government had no quarrel with him. vine own nation have delivered thee unto me.
2785,5390-24512-0009.flac," and the history of those years is one long list of terrible risings and massacres, while cities were ruined, villages wrapped in flames, and men, women, and children perished with hunger."
2786,5390-24512-0034.flac," that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud explanation. the law of moses is like salt, but the talmud is balmy spice, they would say."
2787,5390-24512-0002.flac," had jesus of nazareth been willing to become their earthly king and to lead the nation against the romans, the jews would probably have followed him to a man."
2788,5390-24512-0004.flac, showed them the right attitude in which to regard the roman rule.
2789,5390-24512-0003.flac," the savior sought to heal it. he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centurion, and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesar's."
2790,5390-24512-0044.flac," and so on. not only this, but every scribe was required to know from memory exactly how many letters of each kind there should be in his sheet before he began to write. every sheet of parchment must contain an equal number of lines."
2791,5390-24512-0015.flac," lifted up their hands to heaven, as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath. the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery."
2792,5390-24512-0012.flac," yet no sooner did a daring rebel or murderer gather a band of robbers around him and begin to kill and plunder, than multitudes of jews cried, the christ or messiah has come."
2793,5390-24512-0046.flac," how tedious and meaningless such information appears of what value were all these details. to spend all his days in learning such things as these could have no influence on a man's character, nor make him a power for good in the world."
2794,5390-24512-0021.flac," but a furious madness had possessed the people, and they refused to yield. josephus pleaded in vain. he was not a christian, but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people."
2795,5390-24512-0039.flac," before writing any of the names of god, you must wash your pen. before writing his most sacred name, you must wash your whole body. if after your copy has itself been examined, three corrections have to be made."
2796,5390-24512-0008.flac," as their hero, the nation started on their downward road, as the story of the 40 years which followed the savior's crucifixion clearly shows. for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke."
2797,5390-24512-0011.flac," then if any man shall say unto you, low, here is christ, or there, believe it not, matthew."
2798,5390-24512-0001.flac," when armasaya comes, he will be a great warrior."" they said, he will utterly destroy all our enemies. he will make jerusalem the greatest and richest city."
2799,5390-24512-0023.flac," even a jew who had no faith in jesus christ could see plainly that the ancient power and glory of his nation had gone. at last, the end came. the first wall fell."
2800,5390-24512-0025.flac," pillars fell, beams crumbled to ashes, while round the altar of sacrifice the people of jerusalem lay heaped together. slain in such numbers in the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream."
2801,5390-30096-0027.flac," have you investigated the farm at all? i looked up a real estate dealer living at millville and wrote him about the weg farm. he said if anyone wanted the place very badly it might sell for $3,000. humph."
2802,5390-30096-0007.flac, i just have to form a judgment and take my chances. and when a poor devil goes wrong?
2803,5390-30096-0033.flac, it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years.
2804,5390-30096-0019.flac, and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that lent her face an indescribable charm. everyone loved patsy doyle.
2805,5390-30096-0014.flac," simple in his tastes, modest and retiring, lacking the education and refinements of polite society, but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world. the little man found his great enjoyment in the family circle."
2806,5390-30096-0032.flac," you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift. uncle john looked sober again. anyone live on the place, major? he inquired."
2807,5390-30096-0001.flac," replied the major, compositely. it's a part of my duty, in attending to those affairs you won't look after yourself, to lend certain sums of your money, to needy and ambitious young men who want to start in life. oh, uncle!"
2808,5390-30096-0024.flac, if you would let him have three thousand more. so you took the farm and gave him the money. by did sir. perhaps i am to blame.
2809,5390-30096-0016.flac, while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable. he had never married.
2810,5390-30096-0030.flac," beth is still with louise, you know, and they must find the city deadly dull just now, the farms the thing, and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather, and we'll all have a glorious, lazy time."
2811,5390-30096-0010.flac," with one thing and another. what of it? retorted the little round-faced millionaire, leaning back in his chair and staring fixately at the other. that's what i employ you for. now now gentlemen, cried patsy earnestly."
2812,5390-30096-0026.flac," he replied, what became of the young man? asked the girl. he's a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile. where is millville? in quiet uncle john thoughtfully. somewhere at the north of the state i believe."
2813,5390-30096-0011.flac," of his falling down and worshipping him. john merrick was a multi-millionaire to be sure, but there were peleating circumstances that almost excused him. he had been so busyly occupied in industry."
2814,5390-30096-0017.flac," patricia was the apple of uncle john's eye, and the one goddess enshrined in her doting father's heart, glancing at her."
2815,5390-30096-0008.flac," but some of them must succeed, ventured patsy, in a conciliatory tone. some do, said john merrick, and that repays me for all my trouble."
2816,5390-30096-0031.flac," and we can take mary along to do the cooking, suggested passee, entering into the idea enthusiastically. and eaten our shirt sleeves, said uncle john with a glowing face, and have a cow in some pigs? cry the girl."
2817,5390-30096-0004.flac," and it's the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of. but i'm so glad, cried pantsy, clapping her hands with a delighted gesture. it's a splendid way to do good."
2818,5390-30096-0028.flac," but his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at all. patsy laughed. poor uncle john, she said. the little man, however, was serious."
2819,5390-30096-0002.flac," do you do that?"" exclaimed miss patricia doyle, who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both. so the major says, answered uncle john dryly, and it's true."
2820,5390-30096-0000.flac," chapter 1 uncle john's farm how did i happen to own a farm? asked uncle john, interrupting his soup, long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major oil, who sat opposite."
2821,5390-30096-0012.flac," that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by accident, then he promptly retired, to give other fellows a chance. and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity."
2822,5390-30096-0029.flac, for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind. years ago.
2823,5390-30096-0021.flac," he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market. the thing looked pretty good, john, so i lent him a thousand of your money. quite right. returned uncle john nodding. but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale."
2824,5390-30096-0013.flac," and the welfare and an entertainment of his three nieces. he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of isham, marvin and company."
2825,5390-30096-0025.flac," making five thousand in all. well, it's gone, john, and you've got the farm. the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wegg, and knocked out his patent. i'm so sorry, said patsy, sympatheticly."
2826,5390-30096-0003.flac, asserted the other. he's assisted three or four school young men to start in business in the last year. to my certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars.
2827,5390-30096-0023.flac," but he was decent about it, after all. his father had left him a little farm at millville. he couldn't say what it was worth, but there were sixty acres and some good buildings, and he would deed it to you as security."
2828,5390-30096-0015.flac," that he had been instrumental in founding. being no longer absorbed in business, he had come to the test its every detail, and so allowed his bankers to care for his fortune, and his brother-in-law to disperse his income."
2829,5390-30096-0006.flac, and how can i tell whether they're deserving or not? retorted major oil fiercely. do you want me to become a sleuth or engage detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy?
2830,5390-30096-0009.flac," query the major. you mean all my trouble? well, and your money."
2831,5390-30096-0022.flac," he was in a bad fix. another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off. it would take a lot of money to fight back, 3,000 at least."
2832,5390-30096-0018.flac," in her plain muslin gown, a stranger would be tempted to wonder why. she was red-haired, freckled as a robin's egg, pug-nosed and wide-mouthed, but her blue eyes were beautiful."
2833,5390-30096-0020.flac," and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face. she was nearly 17 years old, not very tall, and her form, to speak charitably."
2834,5390-30096-0005.flac," without capital, you know, many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder. and many will never get it there in any event, declared the major, with a shake of his grizzled head."
2835,5390-30102-0018.flac," and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery. and as instruments to the end, there were several people available who could be of use to her. mignat, the agent, who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell, old hux and his wife,"
2836,5390-30102-0013.flac," louis set a work to tabulate the information she had received thus far, noting the element of mystery each fact evolved. first, captain weg must have been a rich man in order to build this house."
2837,5390-30102-0020.flac," when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs, louise said to him, i've been thinking dear, that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness. that's true, he replied."
2838,5390-30102-0014.flac," secondly, the captain, a surly and silent man, had brought hither, perhaps by force, a young woman as his wife, who was so unhappy that she pined away and died. who was this woman?"
2839,5390-30102-0024.flac," buckling a strap unmoved. who told you i were once a seafar in man? i guessed it. as he appeared indisposed to say more on the subject, she asked, did you sail with captain wegg? partly miss. dan's already now."
2840,5390-30102-0029.flac," do you know where the thompson's live? inquired uncle john? no! whoa, dan! that was the best thing the nag did. he knew how to whoa. thomas called uncle john, turning in his seat."
2841,5390-30102-0002.flac," and men usually admired her graceful figure and her pecan't pretty face, with its crown of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression. there was a rumor that she was engaged to be married to arthur weldon."
2842,5390-30102-0009.flac," the plain folks around milville might speculate listlessly upon the queer doons at the farm, and never get anywhere near the truth. indeed, the strange occurrences she had just heard."
2843,5390-30102-0011.flac," it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at millville. and in undertaking the task, she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detective."
2844,5390-30102-0005.flac," louise merrick was a clever girl, possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of others. her apparent shallowness was a blind of the same character as her assumed graciousness."
2845,5390-30102-0022.flac," when patsy and beth will be able to meet her. that's a good idea, louise. i was wondering what i'd do this morning. tell old hux to get the nag harnessed. the girl ran eagerly upon her errand."
2846,5390-30102-0026.flac, dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle john stood awaiting his niece.
2847,5390-30102-0001.flac," let a mere butterfly existance. her two cousins, frankly agreed that louise was shallow, insincere and inclined to be affected. but of the three girls..."
2848,5390-30102-0023.flac," but he turned without a word to harness the horse. louise stood watching him. your fingers are quite nimble, thomas, considering the fact that you were once a sailor,"" she said. the sailors have to be nimble, miss,"" he returned."
2849,5390-30102-0021.flac," can't we drive over to thompson's this morning, uncle? beth and patsy have planned a tram to the lake, and a row after water lilies. then let us make our call together. we can invite the girl to come here and spend a day with us."
2850,5390-30102-0003.flac," a young man of position in the city, but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing one of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage. and away from her frivolous mother."
2851,5390-30102-0028.flac," or why someone don't knock him on the head, dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look. then he groaned again, leaned forward, and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane."
2852,5390-30102-0015.flac," what had rendered her so unhappy and despairing? thirdly, the captain's only friend had been a crazy man named will thompson. was he crazy before the captain's death or had he become crazed at that time?"
2853,5390-30102-0000.flac," chapter 7. louise sents a mystery louise merrick was the eldest of uncle john's nieces, having just passed her 18th birthday."
2854,5390-30102-0027.flac," i understand, dan. well, i don't. returned uncle john in his whimsical way, as he mounted to the seat beside her. i don't understand how he's happened to live since the landing of columbus, or what he's good for."
2855,5390-30102-0007.flac," and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin. uncle john thought he knew her too, and was very proud of his eldest niece, in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly admirable."
2856,5390-30102-0030.flac," and at the summons old hux came from the barn and approached them. how do you get to miss thompson's place? miss ethel's? another fleeting expression of surprise. yes, we're going over to thank her for her kindness to us."
2857,5390-30102-0004.flac," and the inconsequent home environments, the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways, and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency. one thing was indisputable, however."
2858,5390-30102-0016.flac," the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word. why, unless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible? in the fifth place there was old hux and his blind wife to be considered."
2859,5390-30102-0025.flac," don't jerk the bit for his mouth's tender and it makes him bocky. if he bocks just let him rest a time and then speak to him. daning vicious, he's just ordinary. she climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins."
2860,5390-30102-0017.flac, what did they know about their old master's secret history? what tragic memories lurk beneath the man's perpetual smile and the woman's composed and sightless face? surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity.
2861,5390-30102-0019.flac," and ethel thompson, the school teacher. there might be others, but one or another of these four must know the truth, and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure, so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once."
2862,5390-30102-0012.flac," an occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful. warned however by the rebuff she had met with from uncle john, the girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed investigation to anyone for the present."
2863,5390-30102-0031.flac," thompson's stammered hux, glancing up at them with his bright, elusive smile. well, we're going anyhow, groud mr. merrick."
2864,5390-30102-0006.flac," and while she would have been more lovable, without any pretense or sham, she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was. hatsy and beth thought they knew her."
2865,5390-30102-0008.flac," an extensive course of light literature, not void of detective stories, had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to send a mystery in the history of captain wag."
2866,5390-30102-0010.flac," were nearly forgotten in the community, and soon would be forgotten altogether, unless the quick year of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored. at first, she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking."
2867,1743-142912-0021.flac, turning away toward the green meadows instead. peter didn't wait for scrapper to return.
2868,1743-142912-0029.flac," cast off snake suits. before peter could say another word, cresty had flown away. peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch, and then towards jenny ren's house."
2869,1743-142912-0033.flac," didn't i, peter rabbit? didn't i? didn't i? oh, you certainly did, jenny. you certainly did, and i'm sorry to disturb you, reply, peter meekly. i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing, but i just didn't know who else to go to."
2870,1743-142912-0005.flac, and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody. for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with red tail and then he saw.
2871,1743-142912-0023.flac," every way but the right way. look up over your head, cry the voice, rather a harsh voice."
2872,1743-142912-0003.flac," at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard, and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction, screaming at the top of their voices."
2873,1743-142912-0030.flac," he just couldn't understand about those cast-offs suits of the snake family, and he felt sure that jenny ren could tell him. finally, curiosity got the best of him, and back he scampered, lippery-lippery-lip, to the foot of the tree in which jenny ren had her home."
2874,1743-142912-0031.flac," jenny called peter, jenny ran, jenny ran. no one answered him. he could hear mr. renn singing in another tree, but he couldn't see him. jenny, jenny ran, jenny ran, called peter again."
2875,1743-142912-0009.flac," all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names, but none, not even bully the english sparrow, was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail. when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him,"
2876,1743-142912-0014.flac," the reminded peter that he had often heard scrap or called the b-martin, and now he understood why. do you live on b's altogether asked peter?"
2877,1743-142912-0036.flac," he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you. because i know you know everything, especially everything concerning your neighbors."
2878,1743-142912-0034.flac," go to for what, snap jenny-ren? what is it you've come to me for? a snake skin's replied peter. snake skin's snake skin's streak jenny-ren."
2879,1743-142912-0027.flac," if in your roaming about you run across an old cast-off suit of mr. black snake or any other member of the snake family, i wish you would remember me and let me know, will you, peter, said crusty?"
2880,1743-142912-0019.flac," but if he couldn't see the fly, he could hear the sharp click of scrapper's bill, and he knew, by the way, scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return, that he had caught the fly and it had tasted good."
2881,1743-142912-0015.flac, there wouldn't be any honey if i did.
2882,1743-142912-0013.flac, and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebex did when he caught a fly. but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee. peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up.
2883,1743-142912-0010.flac," scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors. he took them quite modestly, assuring them that he had done nothing."
2884,1743-142912-0006.flac," a white-throated white-breasted bird having a black cap and back, and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at red tail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat."
2885,1743-142912-0016.flac," those that i do catch are mostly drones, and you know the drones are useless. they do no work at all. it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker. i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some don't."
2886,1743-142912-0024.flac," it was cresty the great crested fly catcher. he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird, yet not quite so big as welpham robin, and more slender."
2887,1743-142912-0020.flac," are you going to build in the old orchard this year, aspeter? of course i am declared scrapper. i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him."
2888,1743-142912-0004.flac," of course, peter couldn't be left out of anything like that, and he's scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him."
2889,1743-142912-0017.flac," i am one of farmer brown's best friends if he did but know it. you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family, but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have, i'd like to know who it is."
2890,1743-142912-0035.flac," you don't understand, crite peter, hurriedly? what i want to know is why should cresti the fly catcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast-off suits of the snake family?"
2891,1743-142912-0018.flac," there's a fly away over there beyond the old apple tree, watch me catch it. peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly. he knew that he couldn't have seen it, had it been only one-fourth that distance away."
2892,1743-142912-0028.flac," a-a what, stammered peter? a cast-off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied crusty somewhat impatiently. now, don't forget, peter. i've got to go house hunting, but you'll find me there, or hear about, so if it happens that you find one of those..."
2893,1743-142912-0032.flac, this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes barely snapped. didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed? didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping?
2894,1743-142912-0025.flac," his throat and breast were gray, shading into bright yellow underneath, his back and head were of a grayish brown, with a tint of all at green. a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking."
2895,1743-142912-0002.flac," the rest of us always feel safe when he is about. of course i know him declared peter is face clearing, whereas he now."
2896,1743-142912-0001.flac," he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of chibbex. did you say you're fighting cousin? he asked in a hesitating way. that is what i said, replied chibbex. he is scrapper the kingbird, as of course you know."
2897,1743-142912-0022.flac," just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard, someone called him. peter, oh peter rabbit, called the voice. peter stopped, abruptly sat up very straight. look this way, looked that way, and looked the other way."
2898,1743-142912-0007.flac," he was just a little smaller than wilka braben, and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant. but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that as it was."
2899,1743-142912-0011.flac," peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage. as peter looked up at scrapper, he saw that, like all the rest of the fly catchers, there was just the tiniest of books on the end of his bill."
2900,1743-142912-0012.flac," scrappers slightly raised caps seemed all black, but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red. while peter sat staring up at him, scrappers suddenly darted out into the air."
2901,1743-142912-0026.flac," you seem to be in a hurry, so don't let me detain you, peter, said cresti, before peter could find his time. i just want to ask one little favor of you. what is it, peter? who?"
2902,1743-142912-0000.flac," and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard, such a big proudly. slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot, and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear."
2903,1743-142912-0008.flac," he wasn't afraid, and he intended that everybody should know it, especially redtail. it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird. all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs, calling redtail a robber, and every other bad name he could think of."
2904,1743-142914-0005.flac, he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes. then peter chuckled.
2905,1743-142914-0000.flac," he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch, yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip. peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go."
2906,1743-142914-0032.flac," they look so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world, but for mrs. teeter, peter hastily backed away a few steps, mrs. teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably."
2907,1743-142914-0016.flac," for the first time, peter knows that there were many such little round holes all about. did you make all those little round holes explain, peter?"
2908,1743-142914-0015.flac, then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat. where that longbill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole.
2909,1743-142914-0020.flac, and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take a man-ass peter? long bill chuckled.
2910,1743-142914-0023.flac," that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes it all. it's wonderful, sidepeter. i don't suppose anyone else can find hidden worms that way. why cosin' jack's nipe can? refle-ed longbill promptly."
2911,1743-142914-0001.flac," i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird. redwing was one of the first birds to arrive, and i've neglected him shamefully. when peter thinks of something to do, he waste no time."
2912,1743-142914-0018.flac," peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm, but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface."
2913,1743-142914-0017.flac, and was there a worm in every one asked peter his eyes very wide with interest? long bill nodded.
2914,1743-142914-0034.flac," my, he explained, i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me said he. i'm so thankful i didn't. i don't see how you dared to lay them in the open like this."
2915,1743-142914-0021.flac," long bill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him, and to peter's astonishment, he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all. that's the way i get them said he..."
2916,1743-142914-0010.flac," certainly, i'll excuse your replied, peter, staring around very hard to see what it could be that longbill was making such a good meal of. but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat. there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground."
2917,1743-142914-0025.flac," now, i must be running along. i'm ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get. so peter said goodbye and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool. right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool."
2918,1743-142914-0024.flac," he feeds the same way i do, only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps. perhaps you know him."" peter nodded, ""'i do,' said he. now you speak of it, there is a strong family resemblance, although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before.'"
2919,1743-142914-0008.flac," i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes, so i came right back. i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger."
2920,1743-142914-0003.flac," bush's young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point. the ground was soft and placed quite muddy. peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp, so he hopped along carelessly."
2921,1743-142914-0031.flac, mrs. teeter stood up and stepped aside. then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for aligning four white eggs with big dark blotches on them.
2922,1743-142914-0007.flac," i didn't mean to scare him, apologize peter. i really didn't mean to. do you think he was really very much scared?"
2923,1743-142914-0012.flac," he was quite a little bigger than welcom robin. his tail was short, his legs were short, and his neck was short, but his bill was long enough to make up."
2924,1743-142914-0002.flac," off he started, lippery lippery lip for the smiling pool. he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows."
2925,1743-142914-0006.flac," he scared me for a second. then you were even, said a voice, post-hand. you scared him. i saw you coming, but long bill didn't. peter turned quickly. there was mrs. woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussic of grass."
2926,1743-142914-0026.flac," there was a little pebbly beach. running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill, brownish gray back with black spots and markings, and a white waste coat neatly spotted with black."
2927,1743-142914-0004.flac," from right under his very nose, something shot up into the air with a whistling sound. it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head."
2928,1743-142914-0033.flac," it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it, he wouldn't have known she was there."
2929,1743-142914-0028.flac," it was teeter, the spot at sandpiper, an old friend of peters. peter greeted him joyously."
2930,1743-142914-0022.flac," i think there is one right under my feet now. watch me get him. long bill boarded into the ground until his head was almost against it. when he pulled his bill out, sure enough there was a worm. of course explain long bill, it is only in soft ground that i can do this."
2931,1743-142914-0014.flac," his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him. suddenly longville plunged his bill into the ground, he plunged it in for the whole"
2932,1743-142914-0030.flac," just then mrs. teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter. thank goodness, exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing. if you had taken another step, peter rabbit, you would have stepped right on our eggs. you gave me a dreadful start."
2933,1743-142914-0019.flac, while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for anyone to know that they were there.
2934,1743-142914-0029.flac," before peter could say another word, peter came running towards him, and it was plain to see that peter was very anxious about something. don't move peter rabbit, don't move he cried. why not demand it peter, for he could see no danger, and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move?"
2935,1743-142914-0009.flac," i'm glad it is no one but you, peter, for i was having a splendid meal here, and i should have hated to leave it. you'll excuse me while i go on eating, i hope. we can talk between bites."
2936,1743-142914-0027.flac," every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw."
2937,1743-142914-0013.flac," his back was a mixture of gray, brown, black, and buff, while his breasts and underparts were a beautiful reddish buff. it was his head that made him look queer."
2938,1743-142914-0011.flac, longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion. peter had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance. yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow.
2939,1743-142913-0025.flac," tommy tipped the chickadee sometimes uses an old house. then again, he and mrs. chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves. yellow wing, the flicker, who really is a woodpecker, often uses an old house, but quite often makes a new one."
2940,1743-142913-0023.flac," win some bluebird's stupid, snapped jenny-ran. peter-grand didn't look foolish. of course said he. i forgot all about win some. and skimmer the tree swallow at it, jenny. that's so. i ought to have remembered him, exclaim, peter."
2941,1743-142913-0015.flac," then, as peter shook his head, her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply. cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest, said she. why they wanted goodness knows, but..."
2942,1743-142913-0019.flac," where are your eyes, peter? did you ever see a fly catcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood? she didn't wait for a reply, but rattled on. it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses. look!"
2943,1743-142913-0024.flac," i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year. is there anybody else?"" again jenny ran nodded. yanking the nut hat uses an old house i'm told, but he usually goes up north for his nesting, so gee."
2944,1743-142913-0029.flac," jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently. well, what is it now, she demanded? have you got two homes, aspeter? good gracious, no exclaimed jenny!"
2945,1743-142913-0009.flac, it is so quiet and restful that i love it. mrs. peewee and i are very retiring. we do not like too many near-nabbers. you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while will you ask peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch.
2946,1743-142913-0003.flac, it didn't take peter long to find a pee-wee. he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw a pee-wee fly out and make the same kind of little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies.
2947,1743-142913-0005.flac," but he wasn't sad, as peter well knew. it was his way of expressing how happy he felt. he was a little bigger than his cousin chebuk, but looked very much like him. there was a little notch in the end of his tail."
2948,1743-142913-0004.flac," it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree and a shady, rather lonely part of the green forest. almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintiff tone. pewy pewy pewy"
2949,1743-142913-0022.flac," the older it is, the better it suits me. but the woodpecker seemed to like new houses best, which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us."
2950,1743-142913-0011.flac, that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy.
2951,1743-142913-0001.flac," he just had to find out if there was anything new over there. hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying, pewy, pewy, pewy, peter chuckled happily."
2952,1743-142913-0017.flac," and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking, but snakeskins, ug! by the way, where does christy build, asked peter?"
2953,1743-142913-0026.flac," then there are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screechowl. peter looked surprised. i didn't suppose they nested in holes and trees he exclaimed. they certainly do, more as the pity snap, jenny."
2954,1743-142913-0014.flac," jenny ran was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way in that way and that fussy way of hers, getting her breakfast. she talked. jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to. did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded?"
2955,1743-142913-0010.flac," come as often as you like replied pewy, the oftener the better. back in the old briar patch peter thought overall he had learned about the fly catcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects, it suddenly struck him."
2956,1743-142913-0018.flac," in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny-ren properly. peter looked quite as surprised as he felt. does kresty make the hole, he asked? goodness gracious, no exclaimed jenny-ren."
2957,1743-142913-0021.flac, i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it. there is something settled about an old house. it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does. so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in.
2958,1743-142913-0008.flac," that is something i don't often do. if you please, peter inquired politely, why do folks call you wood-pewy? pewy chuckled happily."
2959,1743-142913-0020.flac," there is down the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute. that's good. i like to see that. it means that next year there will be one more house for someone here in the old orchard. for myself, i prefer old houses."
2960,1743-142913-0006.flac," the upper half of his bill was black, but the lower half was light. peter could see on each wing two whitish bars, and he noticed that peewee's wings were longer than his tail, which wasn't the case with chebuk."
2961,1743-142913-0000.flac," with this, jenny ren disappeared inside her house, and there was nothing for peter to do, but once more, start for the dear old briar patch. on his way, he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest, which was just beyond the old orchard."
2962,1743-142913-0007.flac," but no one could ever mistake peewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over. aren't you here early, asked peter? peewee nodded."
2963,1743-142913-0012.flac," but most of all, peter thought about that queer request of christie's, and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast-off coat of mr. blacksnake."
2964,1743-142913-0016.flac," perhaps they think it will scare robbers away. as for me, i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that. i have to admit that crestian, his wife, or a handsome couple,"
2965,1743-142913-0028.flac," spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable. he lives in it more or less the year around. now i must get back to those eggs of mine. i've talked quite enough for one morning. oh, jenny crad peter, as a sudden thought struck him."
2966,1743-142913-0013.flac," it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace, and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mr. son had kicked his bedclothes off."
2967,1743-142913-0030.flac, one is all i can take care of. a then-wide-demanded peter triumph only does mr. ren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree. it seems to me that he is carried enough in there to build two or three nests.
2968,1743-142913-0027.flac," it would be a good thing for the rest of us that they didn't nest at all, but they do, and an old house of yellow wing, the flicker, suits either of them. kelly always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year."
2969,1743-142913-0002.flac, he usually is one of the last of the fly catcher family to arrive. i didn't expect to find him yet. i wonder what has brought him up so early.
2970,8238-274553-0060.flac," upon due reflection, i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest. this being admitted, i still find great difficulty owing to the refined peculiar nature of our disc agreement."
2971,8238-274553-0061.flac," i have great reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette."
2972,8238-274553-0069.flac, he now explained the mystery.
2973,8238-274553-0066.flac," to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature. somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron."
2974,8238-274553-0073.flac," and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit. upon this hint, he proceeded."
2975,8238-274553-0070.flac," and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed. the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately."
2976,8238-274553-0071.flac, where there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practiced in modern times. the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in herman's way
2977,8238-274553-0068.flac," he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it. i did so, but to little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning. he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud. to my surprise."
2978,8238-274553-0058.flac," we'll hand you this note. i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers. in the event of your declining this request,"
2979,8238-274553-0057.flac," although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me. having finished the chapter, he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done. i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling."
2980,8238-274553-0074.flac, herman would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duelo.
2981,8238-274553-0056.flac, per construction m.
2982,8238-274553-0055.flac, from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world.
2983,8238-274553-0067.flac," he seemed to receive hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course, and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise"
2984,8238-274553-0063.flac," to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation. with sentiments of profound respect, your most obedient servant, van young."
2985,8238-274553-0072.flac," two or three weeks before the adventure, and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation."
2986,8238-274553-0065.flac," at perse. having finished reading, he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself."
2987,8238-274553-0064.flac," herman commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-conplacency."
2988,8238-274553-0062.flac, the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient. i am assured...
2989,8238-274553-0059.flac," having perused the cartel, he wrote the following reply, which i carried to herman. sir, through our common friend, mr. p, i have received your note of this evening."
2990,8238-274553-0023.flac, lay like an incubus upon the university.
2991,8238-274553-0007.flac," that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung. then of no particular age, by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guest respecting his age by any data personally afforded."
2992,8238-274553-0014.flac," ever suspected him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical. the old bulldog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused. the ghost of heraclitus, or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology."
2993,8238-274553-0040.flac," for a short time, he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood near him, saying, as he held it firmly clenched."
2994,8238-274553-0021.flac," my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society, and not even his own household."
2995,8238-274553-0002.flac," through a place in his regard. and here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental confirmation. in later days, this insight grew more clear."
2996,8238-274553-0012.flac," the study and the business of their lives. for this science, a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue."
2997,8238-274553-0031.flac, but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duelo and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself. these things were a hobby which he rode to the death. to ritzner.
2998,8238-274553-0041.flac, the language you have thought proper to employ
2999,8238-274553-0019.flac," the adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he can drive to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created."
3000,8238-274553-0042.flac, in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specification. that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman.
3001,8238-274553-0030.flac," and i believe for some logical talent. as a dualist, he had acquired who had fallen at his hands, but they were many. he was a man of courage undoubtedly."
3002,8238-274553-0049.flac," and taking my arm led me to his apartment. i could hardly forebear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profound discravity what he termed, the refindly peculiar character."
3003,8238-274553-0037.flac," then excessively red. then, dropping his pocket-hankerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table."
3004,8238-274553-0018.flac, which upon each such failure of his praise were the endeavors would suffuse every liniment of his countenance. left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions.
3005,8238-274553-0050.flac," after a tiresome herring in his ordinary style, he took down from his bookshelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duelo, and entertained me for a long time."
3006,8238-274553-0017.flac," in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater."
3007,8238-274553-0051.flac, the theatre of honor by fathon
3008,8238-274553-0033.flac," i perceived the excitement of the latter momentally increasing. at lengthy spoke, offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r, and giving his reasons in detail."
3009,8238-274553-0047.flac," striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course, shattering the glass into fragments. the old company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and ritzner took their departure."
3010,8238-274553-0022.flac, with the memory of the baron ritzner von jung.
3011,8238-274553-0048.flac," as herman went out, the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services. to this i agreed, not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business."
3012,8238-274553-0013.flac," i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character. i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself"
3013,8238-274553-0024.flac, during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the times. the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening
3014,8238-274553-0010.flac," after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex combination of human features, can bang so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity."
3015,8238-274553-0034.flac," to these, the baron replied at length, still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment, and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer."

3117,5456-24741-0000.flac, the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies
3118,5456-24741-0023.flac," the human body itself and is actually existing, therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body."
3119,5456-24741-0015.flac, ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking.
3120,5456-24741-0017.flac, in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas.

3125,5456-24741-0013.flac," look at in themselves, do not contain error. the mind does not err in the mere act of imagining, but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea."
3126,5456-24741-0003.flac," therefore, the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body."
3127,5456-24741-0009.flac," by which the human body has once been affected, being no longer in existence, the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated."

3147,5456-62043-0018.flac," i can't very well leave the game now. it's getting right warm. just pilots beating us all to smash. the wooden completed, we paddled on again. the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last wood yard."
3148,5456-62043-0014.flac," situated alongside and overlooking the bragg table, where the captain was deeply engaged. having now the other pilot as his principal opponent, we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate."
3149,5456-62043-0010.flac," what's the odd quarter-four i should like to know? you only charge me three as i went down. why capped hang, drawed out the wood merchant with a sort of a lear on his yellow countenance, which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold."
3150,5456-62043-0024.flac," this would seem rather better than that we took in yellow faces, but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more. i saw a light just ahead on the right, shall we hail? yes, yes, reply the captain. ring the bell and ask him what's the price of wood up here. i've got you again."
3151,5456-62043-0037.flac," accompanied by the same layer of the same yellow countenance. why darn it all, capped thing? there's but three or four chords left. and since it's you, i don't care if i do let you have it for three, as you're a good customer."
3152,5456-62043-0031.flac," the pilot, with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game, and said in an undertone, 40 a piece for you and i and james, the other pilot, is not bad for one night. i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs."
3153,5456-62043-0021.flac," and they did learn it. once in a while indeed, seeing they had two aces in a braggor, they would venture a bed of five or ten dollars, but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot."
3154,5456-62043-0038.flac," and turned in to take some rest. the fact became apparent, the reader will probably have discovered it sometimes since."
3155,5456-62043-0036.flac," outcred from the cottage the veritable faded hat, coporous colored pants, yellow countenance, and two weeks beard we had seen the night before."
3156,5456-62043-0008.flac," with a two-weeks beard, strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of coppers-colored, lindsey woolsey pants, the legs of which reached a very little below the knee, she's without stockings, a faded, broad-brimmed hat, which had once been black."
3157,5456-62043-0032.flac," there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taken in more than 60 yards, so i was disappointed in my expectation. we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood, the banks being invisible from the middle of the river. there it is, exclaimed the captain, stopper."
3158,5456-62043-0026.flac," the stranger suffers some at the same time. three and a quarter again. are we never to get to a cheaper country? deal, sir, if you please. better luck next time. the other polly's voice was again hurt on deck. how much have you? only about ten chords, sir."
3159,5456-62043-0034.flac, i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petty coat.
3160,5456-62043-0017.flac," the game went on and the paddles kept moving. at 11 o'clock it was reported to the captain that we were nearing the woodyard. the light mean distinctly seen by the pilot on duty. heter ensure then and take in six cords if it's good, see to it thompson."
3161,5456-62043-0030.flac," it appears that two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost $120. the captain, as he rose to see about taking in some good wood, which he felt sure of obtaining now that he had got up above the level country, winked at his opponent."
3162,5456-62043-0028.flac," the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream, paddling on as usual. they at length dawned. the bragg party broke up and settlements were being made, during which operation..."
3163,5456-62043-0006.flac," which he said was situated right round yonder point. but, motor to captain, i don't much like to take wood if the yellow-faced old scoundrel who owns it. he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than anyone else. however, there's no other chance."
3164,5456-62043-0029.flac," the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat, which, by his reckoning,"
3165,5456-62043-0002.flac," a voyage from new orleans to vicksburg and back, including stoppages, generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages. whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the falls, louisville, i have never learned. if she did..."
3166,5456-62043-0003.flac," she must have had a time of it. it was my fate to take passage in this boat. the captain was a good natured, easygoing man, careful of the comfort of his passengers, and exceedingly fond of the game of brag. we had been out a little more than five days."
3167,5456-62043-0015.flac," how does that wood burn and quiet the captain of the mate who was looking on at the game? tisn a much-account i reckon answered the mate. it's cottonwood and most of its green at that well, thompson three aces again stranger"
3168,5456-62043-0009.flac," an appointment is mouth, casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fascinating our spring line answered. why capped in? we must charge e3 in a quarter this time. the devil replied the captain."
3169,5456-62043-0000.flac," a bully boat and a bragg captain. a story of steamboat life on the mississippi by saul smith. does anyone remember the caravan? she was what would now be considered a slowboat. then, 1827."
3170,5456-62043-0007.flac," and then a little less than an hour, when our fuel was about giving out, we made the point. and our cables were out and fastened the trees alongside of a good sized wood pile. hello, colonel. how do you sell your wood this time? a yellow-faced old gentleman."
3171,5456-62043-0012.flac," and there's no other wood yard for nine miles ahead. and if you happen to be nearly out of fuel, why? well, well, interrupted to the captain, we'll take a few quarts under the circumstances, and he returned to his game of brag."
3172,5456-62043-0035.flac," and now you know it. three in the devil broke in the captain. what have you raised on your wood too? i'll give you three and not a cent more. well, reply the petty coat. here comes the old man. they'll talk to you. and sure enough..."
3173,5456-62043-0005.flac," sent downward that the maid had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord. the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot, whose watch was below, and the two passengers who made up the party, and hurried to the deck."
3174,5456-62043-0011.flac," woods res since you went down two weeks ago. besides, you are a whore that you very seldom stop going down."
3175,5456-62043-0022.flac," or if they did venture to call out on two bullets in a braggar, they had the mortification to find one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable. still, with all these disadvantages, they continued playing."

3181,5456-58161-0002.flac," so have we read in classic ovid how hira watched for her beloved and passion youth, leander? she was the fairest of the fair."
3182,5456-58161-0022.flac," a knot that gold and silver can buy, gold and silver may yet untie, unless it is tightly fastened. what's worth doing at all is worth doing well, and a sale of a young man hat and bell is not to be pushed or hastened."
3183,5456-58161-0004.flac," and hitherto in this land of the west, most couples in love have thought it best to follow the ancient way of the rest."
3184,5456-58161-0012.flac, kept bidding a little higher. and every time he made his bid and what she said and all they did was written down for the good of the town by jeans of the daily flyer. a coaching horse as you'd think would buy it for the don and easy victory.
3185,5456-58161-0006.flac," nor how he began to smirk and sue, and dresses lovers to come to woo, or as max meritzek and julian do, when they sit full-bloomed in the ladies' view, and flourish the wondrous baton. he wasn't one of your polish nobles."
3186,5456-58161-0023.flac," so two very reverence graced the scene, and the tall archbishop stood between by prayer and fasting chastened, the pope himself would have come from rome, but garibaldi kept him at home. happily those row pre-lates thought their words with the power that tied the knot."
3187,5456-58161-0027.flac," we'll shiver upon the banks of the sticks. quiet as helpless as they were born, naked souls, and very forlorn. the princess then, we'll shift for herself and lay her royalty on the shelf. she and the beautiful empress yonder, whose robes are now the wide world's wander."

3197,5456-58161-0003.flac," for love was love and better than money, the slire the theft, the sweeter the honey, and kissing was clover all the world over, wherever cupid might wander. so thousands of years have come and gone, and still the moon is shining on, still hiding his torches lighted."
3198,5456-58161-0015.flac," an infant co-inor did the thing, and signed with love or something the same, what's in the name? the princess may consent it."
3199,5456-58161-0018.flac, we commoners stood by the street facade and cut a glimpse of the cavalcade.

3201,5456-58161-0014.flac," she stood such a fire of silks and laces, jewels and gold dressing cases, and ruby broaches, and jets and pearls that every one of her dandy curls brought the price of a hundred common girls. folks thought the last minted."
3202,5456-58161-0024.flac," but another power that love not tied, and i saw the chain round the neck of the bride. a glistening, priceless, marvelous chain, coiled with diamonds again and again, as befits a diamond wedding, yet still was a chain, and i thought she knew it."
3203,5456-58161-0011.flac," and come and go at her pleasure. chet and lava, silver and gold, garnets, emeralds rare to behold, diamonds, sapphires, wealth untold."

3205,1088-134315-0024.flac," that he should return to carous study and set the papers in order was natural and proper. that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers and carous desk might be excused on the score of diligence since he was, to some extent, in the confidence of his employer."
3206,1088-134315-0013.flac," that is a word i never use, nor do i like to hear it employed, he said. blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money."
3207,1088-134315-0037.flac," either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand. accidentally, the valet's hand pressed against the other sleeve, and he received a shock. for the forearm was clearly an artificial one. it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck."
3208,1088-134315-0039.flac, he told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently. what dog am i that i should wait till six?
3209,1088-134315-0029.flac," this time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations. the safe he did not attempt to touch, but there was a small bureau in which kara would have placed his private correspondence of the morning. this however yielded no result."
3210,1088-134315-0030.flac," rum coves, said fisher. he paused for a moment before the closed door of the room, and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework. he lifted it gingerly."
3211,1088-134315-0058.flac," it was a square case covered in red maracol leather. she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry. at last she set a loud, and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face."
3212,1088-134315-0010.flac," what would justify the use of such an awful weapon, she asked? it is amply justified to secure an end, he said, blandly. for example, i want something. i cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel, or by the employment of ordinary means."
3213,1088-134315-0035.flac," a pair of pincines sat crookedly on his nose, and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture. fisher, who was an observer of some discernment, noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit, large black boots,"
3214,1088-134315-0042.flac," good morning to you. if you would only wait, sir, pleaded the agonized fisher. wait be hanged, snore all the other. i've waited three years, i tell you. tell mr. carrot to expect me when he sees me. he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him."
3215,1088-134315-0027.flac," this interested him mightily, and he replaced the checkbook with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly. he paid a visit to the library, where the secretary was engaged in making copies of karr's correspondence."
3216,1088-134315-0016.flac," he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile. i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person, said the girl coldly. i am paying you three pounds a week, i think, he said."
3217,1088-134315-0005.flac," a man against whom my favorite weapon would fail. she looked at him with interest in her eyes. what is your favorite weapon, mr. kara?"" she asked. fear, he said."
3218,1088-134315-0021.flac," he will probably be interested if you take him into the library. very good, sir,"" said the urbanefisher. will you change before you go out? kara shook his head. i think i will go as i am, he said. get me my fur coat. this beastly cold kills me."
3219,1088-134315-0032.flac," he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown, and began to descend the stairs to the hall. he was less than halfway down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him. there is a gentleman who wants to see mr. kara, she said. here is his card."
3220,1088-134315-0014.flac," and according to your argument, they are also justified. it is a matter of plane, he said early. viewed from my standpoint, they are sort-ude criminals. the sort of person that tx meets, i presume, in the course of his daily work."
3221,1088-134315-0026.flac," mr. fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon kara's checkbook, which told him that on the previous day, the greek had drawn 6,000 pounds in cash from the bank."
3222,1088-134315-0023.flac, close the door carefully and return to the house.
3223,1088-134315-0034.flac," he was a man who would have attracted attention, if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance. he was dressed in a well-worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check. he had a top hat, glossy and obviously new at the back of his head."
3224,1088-134315-0006.flac," if he expected her to give him any encouragement for seed, he was disappointed. probably he required no such encouragement, for in the presence of his social inferior, he was somewhat monopolizing. cut a man's flesh and a teal, he said."
3225,1088-134315-0045.flac," at six o'clock, miss, the man replied. there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered. shall i ring up for a messenger? no, i don't think that would be advisable. you would better take it yourself."
3226,1088-134315-0041.flac," deftly, he lifted his left hand from the pocket, croaked the elbow by some quick manipulation, and thrust the books, which the valet most reluctantly handed to him, back to the place from when he had taken them. while mr. kara, i will call it my own time."
3227,1088-134315-0009.flac," is that your creed?"" she asked quietly. part of it, miss holland, he smiled. she played idly with the letter she held in her hand, balancing it on the edge of the desk, her eyes downcast."
3228,1088-134315-0033.flac," fisher took the card from the salver and read, mr. george gather cole, jr. traveler's club. i'll see this gentleman, he said, with a sudden brisk interest. he found the visitor standing in the hall."
3229,1088-134315-0044.flac," mr. gather call said the girl quickly. fisher nodded. yes, miss, i couldn't get him to stay though. she perched her lips thoughtfully. mr. kara will be very cross, but i don't see how you can help it. i wish you would called me."
3230,1088-134315-0055.flac, in that case was a new steel key.
3231,1088-134315-0002.flac," to disturb a relationship which i have always hoped would be mutually pleasant. if you will allow gather cole, who will be unconscious of the party's playing, to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself."
3232,1088-134315-0012.flac," providing always that i can secure my object in the time. otherwise, he shrugged his shoulders. i see, she said nodding her head quickly. i suppose that is how blackmailers feel. he frowned."
3233,1088-134315-0018.flac," to refuse the favors of remington cara was, by him, regarded as something of an affront."
3234,1088-134315-0007.flac," whip a man in the memory of it passes. frighten him, fill him with a sense of foreboding and apprehension, and let him believe that something dreadful is going to happen, either to himself or to someone he loves. better the latter."
3235,1088-134315-0038.flac," and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand, took hold of the gloved left hand, and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat. where is kara, grout the stranger?"
3236,1088-134315-0047.flac," special service department, scotland d.r. whitehall. he put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change. largest the house was, cara did not employ a regular staff of servants. a maid in a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff."
3237,1088-134315-0053.flac," said the woman doubtfully. i wish he'd brick it up. the same as he has the lower seller. i get the horrors sitting here at night expecting the door to open and the ghost of the mad lord to come out. him that was killed in africa. ms. holland laughed. i want you to go out now, she said."
3238,1088-134315-0025.flac," kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point. in his more generous moments, he would address his bodyguard as fred, and on more occasions than one, and for no apparent reason, had tipped his servant over and above his salary."
3239,1088-134315-0054.flac," the girl ascended to the upper floor. again, she watched from the window the disappearing figure. once out of sight, miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness. from her bag, she produced a small purse and opened it."
3240,1088-134315-0040.flac," six o'clock, eh? you will tell mr. cara that i called. give me those books. but i assure you, sir, stammered fisher. give me those books, word the other."
3241,1088-134315-0050.flac," the maid, who was also cook, arose up as the girl entered. it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen, miss,"" she smiled. i'm afraid to rather lonely miss his beal said the girl sympathetically. lonely miss cried the maid."
3242,1088-134315-0017.flac," i intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably. thank you,"" said the girl quietly, but i am already being paid quite sufficient. she left him, a little astonished and not a little ruffled."
3243,1088-134315-0028.flac," answering letters appealing for charitable donations, and in the haque words which fall to the secretaries of the great. havier plenished the fire, asked deferentially for any instructions, and returned again to his quest."
3244,1088-134315-0046.flac, she handed him the letter and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription.
3245,1088-134315-0057.flac," an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected. she returned the papers to the drawer, pushed it to, and locked it. she gave her attention to the second drawer. her hand shook a little as she pulled it open."
3246,1088-134315-0004.flac," cara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope. he rang a bell on his table, and the girl who had so filled tx with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room. you will see that this is delivered miss holland."
3247,1088-134315-0019.flac," he rang the bell, this time for his valet. ""'fisher,' he said. ""'i am expecting a visit from a gentleman named gather cole, a one-armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes.'"
3248,1088-134315-0011.flac," if i can buy it, well and good. if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me, so much the better. if i can obtain it by any merit i possess, i utilize that merit."
3249,1088-134315-0008.flac," and you will hurt him beyond forgetfulness. fear is a tyrant and a despot, more terrible than the rack, more potent than the stake. fear is many-eyed and sees horrors where normal vision only sees the ridiculous."
3250,1088-134315-0001.flac," the apologies which are due to you. i feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your esteem nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self-respect. i am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man, george gather cole."
3251,1088-134315-0056.flac, in two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents. it was a large safe of the usual type. there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box.
3252,1088-134315-0020.flac, to taint him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him.
3253,1088-134315-0052.flac," i know he goes in sometimes because i tried to dodge that my brother, who's a policeman, taught me. i stretched a bit of white cotton across it, and it was broke the next morning. mr. kara keeps some of his private papers in there, so the girl quietly. he has told me so himself."
3254,1088-134315-0000.flac," as you know, and as i have given you proof, i have the greatest admiration in the world for one whose work for humanity has one such universal recognition. i hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning, and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person."
3255,1088-134315-0015.flac," tx, he went on somewhat irregularly, is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect. you will probably meet him again, for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself. i need hardly tell you."
3256,1088-134315-0051.flac, i fairly get the creeps sitting here hour after hour. it's that door that gives me the hump. she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled-looking door of unpainted wood. that's mr. carras' wine-seller. nobody's been in it but him.
3257,1088-134315-0043.flac," fisher went back to the library. the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up. i am afraid miss holland, i've got myself into very serious trouble. what is that, fisher? ask the girl."
3258,1088-134315-0048.flac," the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle-aged domestic who was parlor-made, serving-made, and housekeeper in one. miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letter she had typed that afternoon."
3259,1088-134315-0022.flac," he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street. keep my fire going, put all my private letters in my bedroom, and see that miss holland has her lunch. fisher followed him to his car, wrapped the fur rug about his legs."
3260,1088-134315-0003.flac," i shall feel that his trip, which has cost me a large sum of money, will not have been wasted. i am, dear mr. meredith, yours very sincerely, remington kara."
3261,1088-134315-0031.flac," there was a little knob for the purpose, and let it fold gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself. rum, cove, he said again, and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up, left the room, closing the door softly behind him."
3262,1088-134315-0049.flac," but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her. she heard the soft thud of the front door closing, and rising, she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street. she watched fisher until he was out of sight."
3263,1088-134315-0036.flac," and a pair of pearl studs. the newcomer glared round at the valet. take these, he ordered parampturally pointing to the books under his arm. fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to a system."
3264,1088-134318-0006.flac," had tx returned, he slipped from the bed and went to the door, opened it slightly, and listened. tx with a search warrant might be a source of panic, especially if he shrugged his shoulders, he had satisfied tx and delayed his suspicions."
3265,1088-134318-0002.flac," to the hateful eyes of the girl's father, who stood with folded arms, glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor. to the smoke-stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof."
3266,1088-134318-0003.flac," to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy, infernal machine under his chair."
3267,1088-134318-0008.flac," yes, sir, said the servant. such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him. there was much that he had to do, and that knight's freedom would assist him materially. perhaps, kara hesitated. perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock."
3268,1088-134318-0009.flac," bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk, or better still, place them on a plate in the hall. very good, sir, said the man, and withdrew. down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tessellated hallway."
3269,1088-134318-0014.flac," he pushed open the door and announced mr. gather cole, and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who, with top hat still on the top of his head, and his overcoat dangling about his heels, must have made a remarkable picture."
3270,1088-134318-0013.flac," then lead on. fisher showed the way up the stairs. this time the traveler carried no books. his left arm hung limply by his side, and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket, without its owner being aware of the fact."
3271,1088-134318-0000.flac, chapter 12
3272,1088-134318-0020.flac," at that moment there came from kara's room a faint, clang. what's that? asked the visitor a little startled. mr. kara's put down his steel latch, said fisher with a smile, which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch."
3273,1088-134318-0010.flac," muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism. mr. kara will see you, sir, said fisher. oh, said the other, glaring at the unaffending fisher. that's very good of him."
3274,1088-134318-0004.flac," he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day, and this was the anniversary. he remembered other things more pleasant."
3275,1088-134318-0016.flac," no more patagonia, he roared. no more tierra del fuego. he paused. certainly, he replied to some question, but not patagonia. he paused again."
3276,1088-134318-0005.flac, he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would-be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pizarra. and...
3277,1088-134318-0001.flac," it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasants cabin on the hillside outside dorazo, to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at carras wim all that life held for a man."
3278,1088-134318-0015.flac," fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hull below. ten minutes later, he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him. fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion."
3279,1088-134318-0007.flac," kara breathed a sigh of relief, and his face was breathed in smiles. well, of course, tell him to come up. ask him if he mined seeing me in my room. i told him you're in bed, sir, and he used shocking language, said fisher. kara laughed. send him up, he said."
3280,1088-134318-0018.flac," damn all greeks, he said jovili, and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully, the smile being his very own, the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him. the traveler touched the other on the chest with his right hand. never, trust a greek, he said."
3281,1088-134318-0017.flac," and fisher, standing at the foot of the stairs, wondered what had occurred to make the visitors so genial. i suppose your check will be honored all right, asked the visitors ardonically, and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door."
3282,1088-134318-0021.flac," until 11 o'clock at any rate. he is a funk snapped the other, a beastly funk. he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread, opened the front door without assistance, slammed it behind him, and disappeared into the night."
3283,1088-134318-0011.flac," yes, sir, said fisher. look here. the man thrust out his face. do you see those gray hairs in my beard? the embarrassed fisher grinned. is it gray? challenge the visitor with a roar."
3284,1088-134318-0019.flac," always get your money in advance. is that clear to you?"" yes, sir, said fisher. but i think you will always find that mr. carrot is always most generous about money. don't you believe it? don't you believe it, my poor man,"" said the other. you..."
3285,1088-134318-0012.flac," yes, sir, said the valet hastily. is it real gray and sister the visitor? pull one out and see. the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile. i couldn't think of doing a thing like that, sir. oh, you couldn't sneer the visitor."
3286,1088-129236-0026.flac," a midnight bell, a passing groan. these are the sounds we feed upon. behold there in the wood the fine madman. he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights. he dilates. he is twice a man."
3287,1088-129236-0027.flac," he walks with arms a kimbo. he salil acquises. he accosts the grass and the trees. he feels the blood of the violet, the clover, and the lily in his veins. and he talks with the brook that what's his foot."
3288,1088-129236-0030.flac," into the most pitiful and abject, it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world, so only it have the countenance of the beloved object. in giving him to another, it still more gives him to himself."
3289,1088-129236-0029.flac, the like force has the passion over all his nature. it expands the sentiment. it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart.
3290,1088-129236-0028.flac," the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse. it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under any other circumstances."
3291,1088-129236-0025.flac," the clouds have faces as he looks on them. the trees of the forest, the waving grass, and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent, and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite. yet nature soothes and sympathizes."
3292,1088-129236-0018.flac, that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages where an affection contrived to give a witchcraft. surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances.
3293,1088-129236-0011.flac," dual care and canker and fear. with thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of joy, round it all the musesync. but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of today and yesterday."
3294,1088-129236-0016.flac," for persons are love's world, and the coalesced philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love, without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature, ought derogatory to the social instincts."
3295,1088-129236-0007.flac," glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal heart of all, and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames."
3296,1088-129236-0015.flac," he holds her books to help her, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct. among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him."
3297,1088-129236-0008.flac," only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aide we may attain that inward view of the law, which i'll describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle be holding."
3298,1088-129236-0017.flac," yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances, and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows. but here is a strange fact. it may seem to many men in revising their experience."
3299,1088-129236-0023.flac," by loving heart. in the noon and the afternoon of life, we still throw about the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough, but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear, for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love."
3300,1088-129236-0003.flac," establishes marriage, and gives permanence to human society. the natural association of the sentiment of love with the hate of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints, whichever youth and mage it confess to be true to their throbbing experience."
3301,1088-129236-0002.flac," unites him to his race. pludges him to the domestic and civic relations. carries him with new sympathy into nature, enhances the power of the senses, opens the imagination, adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes."
3302,1088-129236-0012.flac, the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society. what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment?
3303,1088-129236-0010.flac," which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment. he will shrink and moan. alas, i know not why, but infinite compunctions imbiter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name."
3304,1088-129236-0013.flac," and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between two parties. perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet them again, but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers."
3305,1088-129236-0014.flac," it is the dawn of civility and grace in the course and rustic. the rude village boy teases the girls about the schoolhouse door, but today he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel."
3306,1088-129236-0004.flac," one must not be too old. the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom."
3307,1088-129236-0000.flac," every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments. each of its joys ripens into a new want. nature, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking."
3308,1088-129236-0001.flac," in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light. the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment of human life."
3309,1088-129236-0020.flac," the morning and the night varied in chantments. when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound, and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory."
3310,1088-129236-0024.flac," all other pleasures are not worth its pains. and when the day was not long enough, but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections, when the head boiled all night on the pillow with a generous steed it resolved on."
3311,1088-129236-0006.flac," for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak, though it begin with the young, yet for six not the old, or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old."
3312,1088-129236-0005.flac, and therefore i now incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love. but from these formidable sensors i shall appeal to my seniors.
3313,1088-129236-0022.flac," the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water, but as plutarch said, enamelt in fire, and make the study of midnight. thou art not gone being gone, whereer thou art."
3314,1088-129236-0021.flac," when no place is too solitary and none too silent, for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts, than any old friends, though best and purest, can give him. for the figures, the motions."
3315,1088-129236-0009.flac," and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history. for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured."
3316,1088-129236-0019.flac," no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things anew. which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art, which made the face of nature radiant with purple light."
3317,3240-131232-0002.flac," so then, that the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different origins, from different worlds perhaps. have entered a region of suspension over this earth, walking near each other, long duration."
3318,3240-131232-0023.flac," and that in his opinion they had been upon the ground in the first place, but that there had been some unusual condition a loft comes out in his observation upon the curious as your blue appearance of the sun at the time."
3319,3240-131232-0034.flac," again, ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind. and, civilly, a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes, with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris, snatching up dozens of snakes."
3320,3240-131232-0037.flac," suggests to me something of a migratory nature, but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january, if ever. as to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky, prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough."
3321,3240-131232-0011.flac," though it harmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary source, and of course with other data too, is inadequate to account for two peculiarities of the fall of frogs. that never has a fall of tadpole's been reported?"
3322,3240-131232-0005.flac," quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from a magnet. theoretically, the attraction of a magnet should decrease with the square of the distance, but the falling off is found to be almost abrupt at a short distance."
3323,3240-131232-0025.flac," there's no mention of whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place, nor of a whirlwind. lizards."
3324,3240-131232-0033.flac," stones, fence rails, limbs of trees, say that the snakes occupied the next gradation and would be the next to fall."
3325,3240-131232-0010.flac," but newtonian gravitation admits attraction only. then newtonian gravitation can be only one-third acceptable even to the orthodox, or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of forces. or still simpler, here are the data."
3326,3240-131232-0004.flac, long duration. other indications of long duration. i think of a region somewhere above this earth's surface in which gravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the distance.
3327,3240-131232-0014.flac," before we take up an especially expression upon the fall of immature and larval forms of life to this earth, and the necessity then of conceiving of some factor besides mere stationeryness or suspension or stagnation."
3328,3240-131232-0009.flac," orthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces. gravitational is one of these forces. all other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness irrespective of distance, as well as of attraction."
3329,3240-131232-0021.flac," in the first place. he found that the snails had appeared after the rain, that astonished rustics had jumped to the conclusion that they had fallen. he met one person who said that he had seen the snails fall. this was his error, says the investigator."
3330,3240-131232-0029.flac," rather strictly localized ore in a space of two blocks, and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found. they were crawling on sidewalks, in yards, and in streets, and in masses."
3331,3240-131232-0003.flac," final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance with hail, or that hail stones too when large are phenomena of suspension of long duration. that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could become so great only in falling from the clouds."
3332,3240-131232-0020.flac," but has always sought positively to prove or to disprove something that was conceived of or suspected in advance. as i suspected, says this correspondent, i found that the snails were of a familiar land species, that they had been upon the ground"
3333,3240-131232-0031.flac," in the streets of memphis, january 15, 1877, why? that's sensible. that's the common sense that has been against us from the first. it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not."
3334,3240-131232-0027.flac," these data have any meaning or lack of meaning or degree of damnation you please. but, in the matter of the fall that occurred at memphis, tennessee, occurs some strong significances."
3335,3240-131232-0039.flac," fall of ants, cambridge, england, summer of 1874, some were wingless."
3336,3240-131232-0030.flac," but none were found on roofs or any other elevation above ground and none were seen to fall. if you prefer to believe that the snakes had always been there or had been upon the ground in the first place and that it was only that something occurred to call special attention to them,"
3337,3240-131232-0015.flac, there are other data that are similar to data of false of fishes. science gossip.
3338,3240-131232-0008.flac," but the omnipresence of heterogeneity or living fish is also, ponds of fresh water, oceans of salt water. as to the law of gravitation, i prefer to take one simple stand."
3339,3240-131232-0017.flac, none seemed to fall by the writer of this account. snail said to be quite different to any previously known in this district.
3340,3240-131232-0036.flac," records the fall and says that there were thousands of them. the usual whirlwind explanation is given, but in what locality snakes exist in such abundance is yet a mystery. this matter of enormous of numbers"
3341,3240-131232-0024.flac," that, according to dusveter, december 1892, upon august 9, 1892, a yellow cloud appeared over pattern-borne germany. from this cloud fell a torrential rain in which were hundreds of muscles."
3342,3240-131232-0000.flac," then i think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of mississippi weeks or months before may 11th, 1894. no, i don't look for it, and inevitably find it. or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up indefinitely."
3343,3240-131232-0013.flac," little orbeg, if such falls be attributed to whirlwinds, and more likely to fall from the super sargaso sea if, though very tentatively and provisionally, we accept the super sargaso sea."
3344,3240-131232-0032.flac," and had not been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses in the first place, if we try to accept that these snakes have been raised from some other part of this earth's surface in a whirlwind. if we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them."
3345,3240-131232-0001.flac, but may after a while be shaken down by storms.
3346,3240-131232-0012.flac," that never has a fall of full-grown frogs been reported. always, frogs a few months old. it sounds positive, but if there'd be such reports, they are somewhere out of my range of breeding. but tadpoles would be more likely to fall from the sky than would frogs."
3347,3240-131232-0026.flac," that, during a heavy shower july 3rd, 1860, he heard a peculiar sound at his feet and looking down saw a snake lying as if stunned by a fall. it then came to life. very snake, about a foot long."
3348,3240-131232-0022.flac, in such quantities that they were shoveled up. it is said that the snails may be considered as a local species.
3349,3240-131232-0038.flac," follow fishes june 13, 1889 in holland, ants, august 1st, 1889's throssburg. little toads, august 2nd, 1889's savoy."
3350,3240-131232-0019.flac, in which there can be approximation only to justice or to injustice. that to be fair is to have no opinion at all. that to be honest is to be uninterested. that to investigate is to admit prejudice. that nobody has ever really investigated anything.
3351,3240-131232-0016.flac," that small snails of a land species had fallen near redreth cornwall, july 8, 1886, during a heavy thunderstorm. roads and fields strewn with them so that they were gathered up by the hat full."
3352,3240-131232-0018.flac, of great and deserved repute. i thought i should for once like to trace the origin of one of these fabulous tales. our own acceptance is that justice cannot be in an intermediate existence.
3353,3240-131232-0035.flac," i don't know how many to add in, hundreds maybe. but, according to the account of this occurrence in the new york times, there were thousands of them, alive, from one foot to 18 inches in length."
3354,3240-131232-0006.flac," horses, and barns, and elephants, and flies, and dodoes, moas, and teradactals. leaves from modern trees and leaves of the carboniferous era. all, however, tending to disintegrate into homogenous-looking muds or dusts."
3355,3240-131232-0028.flac," our quasi-reasoning upon this subject applies to all segregation so far considered. monthly weather review, january 15, 1877. that..."
3356,3240-131232-0007.flac," red or black or yellow, treasure trolls for the paleontologists and for the archaeologists. accumulations of centuries, cyclones of egypt, greece and assyria. fish is dried and hard, there is short time, others there long enough to putrify."

3360,3240-131231-0037.flac," very young menos had been caught up. in the london times, march 2, 1859, is a letter from mr. aaron roberts, curate of st. peter's carmathon. in this letter,"
3361,3240-131231-0029.flac," vicar of abedere, asserting that the fall had occurred chiefly upon the property of mr. nixon of mountain ash."
3362,3240-131231-0020.flac, and something that strikes my attention here is that these frogs are described as almost white. i'm afraid there is no escape for us. we shall have to give to civilization upon this earth some new worlds. places with white frogs in them.

3436,3240-131231-0072.flac, the fish were all dead and indeed stiff and hard when picked up immediately after the occurrence. by all of which i mean that we have only begun to pile up our data of things that fall from a stationary source overhead.

3458,8098-278278-0011.flac," pod didn't. that night he got up a fine supper and invited some old friends. he bought a big porterhouse steak, thick and tender, and personally broiled it on his patent folding stove."
3459,8098-278278-0036.flac," pod went fishing that afternoon with a gun and took the whole arsenal along with him, including the axe. somewhere about five o'clock, pod came into camp with a good mess of trout. after cleaning the fish, he took off his guns."
3460,8098-278278-0028.flac," a board sign informed us it was simply turkey creek. i couldn't see any turkeys, but there was good pastureage around. the hot trip through the timber made us all hungry."
3461,8098-278278-0032.flac," that's the thief there! next morning, koon skin was the first to return from fishing, and looked much excited. when pod returned, he told him he had seen huge bear tracks. he was going bear hunting. pod laughed at him."
3462,8098-278278-0012.flac," just when everything was on the table, and the guests were finding stones and tin plates to sit on, done, not having had a thing to eat for an hour, cooley pulled the hot steak off the platter and dropped it on the ground."
3463,8098-278278-0018.flac," the only trouble will be in starting the fire,"" said pod. just as soon as it's once going, it ought to burn smoothly enough."
3464,8098-278278-0033.flac, that was my experience in the woods of wisconsin. the men at the sawmill said we should see bear in this forest.
3465,8098-278278-0004.flac, the happy father called personally on pod and asked him to act as godfather at the baptismal service sunday afternoon. the impressive ceremony took place at the cabin of miss pathagarina.

3467,8098-278278-0027.flac, but we had to change our course sum and hustle faster for the blazing trail chased us. kuhn'skin learned a new lesson and turned down the corner of the page so he'd recollect it.

3469,8098-278278-0037.flac, and laid down on the grass and wondered if that crazy valet had run across any more bear tracks. he wasn't there long when suddenly i heard yells issuing from the canyon downstream round the bend.
3470,8098-278278-0019.flac," koon's skin's opinion didn't benefit pod much. his heart would fire wasn't very satisfactory, but with some dry brush the man got the meal underway. next morning we visited the noted petrified stump."
3471,8098-278278-0025.flac, he lagged behind to do the blazing and pretty soon i smelled smoke. the professor snuffed. smells as if the woods were on fire somewhere hinted pod. look behind you. they are i exclaimed.
3472,8098-278278-0023.flac," ""'best to go through the woods,' said the valet. so we were headed for the timber. our tramp through the forest i cannot soon forget. up and down the rocky heights through thickets of quaking asp and pine."
3473,8098-278278-0030.flac, pod said he would fry the fish and went at it so enthusiastically that he forgot to put the bag of cornmeal back in its place. after the meal was over he began to look around for the bag. it was nowhere to be found.
3474,8098-278278-0007.flac, and kicked so frantically when the priest took her in his arms that two flat irons were tied to its feet to keep them down. it was simply nervousness because the high altitude affected the child's nerves.
3475,8098-278278-0016.flac, about six o'clock we went into camp on the margin of a famous petrified forest. pot objected at first because of the scarcity of firewood.

3477,8098-278278-0005.flac, as the aged grandmother wished to witness it. podd said he was somewhat embarrassed about attending. since he had forgotten almost all his latin.
3478,8098-278278-0009.flac," pod said the scene was without a parallel. he was soaked to his equator. the half-criscund, half-drawn pythagorean-a-pardina was picked up from the flood with a table spoon, and the ceremony finished."
3479,8098-278278-0038.flac," the shouting sounded nearer every second, and i soon distinguished koonskins' voice. pod got up from the ground excitedly. koonskins in trouble, playing enough, said pod allowed to himself. i must run to his aid."

3481,8098-278278-0026.flac, and pod caught that erudite valet-backed woodsman in the act of setting a tree on fire with oil and matches. fortunately for us the wind wasn't blowing strong.
3482,8098-278278-0010.flac, then she was rolled in the barrel to get all the water out of her and put to bed with hot flat irons at her feet to prevent croup and mumps. then the wake broke up. i don't believe the child understood a word that the priest said.

3484,8098-278278-0014.flac," the ladies looked at the dog, and then at pod, not knowing which to think. then feeling sensitive about accepting the best part of the steak, insisted upon pods having one of their pieces and coonskin the other."

3486,8098-278252-0024.flac, i saw a meadow-lark on the first of march. this day i heard bluebirds and robins singing galley. it looked as though spring had come to stay. i expected that day to reach dalton on the 8 miles distant.
3487,8098-278252-0035.flac," to be good, chocolate must be well dissolved. no pot was to be had, save the flower pot with a hole in the bottom. a great idea popped into my head."
3488,8098-278252-0037.flac," chocolate bean, caster oil bean, pork bean, and all kinds. i first ate the cake of chocolate, then some sugar, and drank two dippers full of hot water, then shook myself."
3489,8098-278252-0003.flac," and when i rode out onto the stage, the house shook with laughter and cheers. i made a short address and announced that i would sell photos of mac, aroni, and his master at the door."
3490,8098-278252-0034.flac," a pint of corned oysters, light weight, some crackers and leaf lard to take the place of butter and a cake of bitter chocolate. i left a few things unmolested, such as soap."
3491,8098-278252-0023.flac," cannon boomed, steam whistles shriek, and the citizens shouted and hurried, and i was glad that mack was not with me to add his salute."
3492,8098-278252-0004.flac," that theater put me way ahead financially. thursday morning i called on the mayor, mark hanna, and senator garfield, and added the autographs of all three to my album."
3493,8098-278252-0008.flac, twenty minutes later a boy from a cozy home yelled to me. i had passed to some distance and did not understand. it sounded like...
3494,8098-278252-0001.flac," from there we marched to superior street, where cheers greeted us on every hand. the papers had heralded my advent, and as in the other towns and cities."
3495,8098-278252-0016.flac," with this i returned to my companions somewhat warmer physically, but cooler in spirit. the hotel in kraya hoga falls received as most hospitably."
3496,8098-278252-0005.flac, mr. garfield invited me to attend the weekly dinner and reception of the beer and skittles club that evening. i went and enjoyed myself.
3497,8098-278252-0027.flac," i made for his. he said the town hadn't reached the hotel stage of development yet, but that he would gladly take me in, provided i'd sleep with his clerk in the garret."
3498,8098-278252-0014.flac," my dear sir, do you know a hundred people have stopped me today and told me it is cold? i have tramp nearly twenty miles without stopping to warm or eat."
3499,8098-278252-0009.flac," i hesitated a moment in the biting wind, then retraced my steps and called to the lad. what's that you said?"
3500,8098-278252-0000.flac," much pomp in several circumstances. from willoughby we went to cleveland. my route through the beautiful city lay along one of the finest resident streets in america, the famous euclid avenue."
3501,8098-278252-0038.flac," that mixture might suit my stomach, i thought, but it doesn't delight my palate. i felt i had eaten a heavy meal unwittingly and sat down to digest it. i hadn't sat long before i felt myself swelling."
3502,8098-278252-0002.flac, the newspaper artists had taxed their imaginations to picture pod and mac.
3503,8098-278252-0018.flac," waving hats and arms and calling to me to be their guest. i was puzzled to know which invitation to accept. while deliberating one of the landlords approached, and taking my arm led me to his comfortable host, delri."
3504,8098-278252-0015.flac," and i resolve to let the next fellow have the same dose i have been taking half-hourly all day. now if you are satisfied that it is a cold day, i will bid you good night."
3505,8098-278252-0011.flac," wrap my ears and continued my journey like an ice-covered volcano. a mile beyond a wagon with a family in it passed me, and the man said, cold my friend, and dusk a farmer inquired."
3506,8098-278252-0006.flac, only making 13 miles.
3507,8098-278252-0033.flac," leaving heads and his odd guest alone. as soon as the junior member, heads' father, came in, heads took my animals to the shed and fed them, and told me to help myself to the best in the store."

3509,8098-278252-0030.flac," and felt boots encased in heavy overshoes. these rural men eyed me with suspicion until i mentioned macaroni. then there was a rush to the door, as its swung open, inleep my great dog."
3510,8098-278252-0013.flac," i ambled up, put a foot on the hub of a wheel and said, i simply want to say it's a cold day. yooo! as soon as he had finished, i said by way of a civil explanation."
3511,8098-278252-0040.flac," after which i excused myself to the clerk and went to bed, and dreamed i was being cremated alive."
3512,8098-278252-0010.flac," yelled the scamp. i was mad enough to unload my winterster, but i didn't."
3513,8098-278252-0039.flac, something within was sizzling and brewing and steaming gas and steam choked me. i was sure there was going to be a demonstration in my honor that i had not bargained for. the yeast-cake came to mind. then i knew the cause.
3514,8098-278252-0007.flac," a mile beyond, two men reminded me it was a very wintery day. then a woman drove past and tossed me the comforting reminder, don't you find it awfully cold? i did not reply to the last two."
3515,8098-278252-0025.flac," that once i was compelled to crawl along the top of a rail fence, 200 feet and more, and drag my jackass. at dusk i had covered only three miles, then i saw lodgings."
3516,8098-278252-0020.flac, canton did him honor. i witnessed the leave taking at his house. his ride to the train in the coach drawn by four grays under escort of a band.
3517,8098-278252-0022.flac," i was successful beyond my hopes and expectations, securing fine pictures of his study and parlor. the president's inauguration at washington calls for the deafening demonstration."
3518,8098-278252-0021.flac," and hurt him to deliver his farewell address from the rear platform of his private car. i spent wednesday night in masalon, and next morning returned to canton to take some interior photographs of mckinley's home."
3519,8098-278252-0036.flac," did you ever try it? if not, don't let your curiosity get the better of you. chocolate belongs to the bean family, and the bean is a very treacherous thing."
3520,8098-278252-0031.flac," came several queries in a bunch. no, i said. he has killed a bull, chewed up a ram, made thanksgiving mincemeat of several dogs chased to pig up a tree."
3521,8098-278252-0032.flac," and only this morning a two chickens and a duck and chased a farmer into his hay loft, but he doesn't bite. my statement had a sensational effect on the assembly. who, one by one, sneaked out of the door."
3522,8098-278252-0019.flac, where he rarely entertain me and my animals. the pageant that celebrated the departure of william mckinley to the seat of government was a fair estimate of the regard in which his fellow citizens held him.
3523,8098-278252-0028.flac," i found this store full of loungers who patronized the chairs, soap and starch boxes, macroll kids encounter forming a silent circle around a towering stove in the center."
3524,8098-278252-0026.flac," a store loomed into view shortly. i was elated. according to the sign over the entrance, the younger generation was the ruling power, yet red. hezekiah, bremley, and father."
3525,8098-278252-0029.flac," the village treasurer wore a boiled shirt and brass collar buttons, but no collar or coat. his companions were generally attired in flannel shirts of different hues and patterns."
3526,8098-275181-0016.flac," and you was prowling around the fields. go off now out there by that stump. full of wonder and curiosity, i retired to the stump. tom meanwhile turned out the mass of nests."
3527,8098-275181-0009.flac," no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate, together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact. it was clear that something must be done, and at once too."
3528,8098-275181-0030.flac," these numerous bites, however, were followed by no serious ill-effects. the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass, that he had caught hold of one of the tined legs."
3529,8098-275181-0013.flac," each a wide of fine dry grass as large as a quart box. these were gathered up and filled the great basket. there, said he triumphantly. don't them smell mousy? they did, certainly."
3530,8098-275181-0019.flac, as i had heard it said that foxes did when mousing. instantly two spry brown hands from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip. as a fox i struggled tremendously.
3531,8098-275181-0003.flac," and by day they wondered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beach-nuts, which were very plentiful that fall. all went well until the last week in october, when on taking the census one morning a turkey was found to be missing."
3532,8098-275181-0020.flac," then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone. do you see now he demanded? i saw, but a fox would bite you, i objected. let him bite, said tom."
3533,8098-275181-0021.flac," with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stoneheaps were, and where we had oftenest heard fox's bark. selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump,"
3534,8098-275181-0026.flac," as i ran, two or three dolled wax came to my ear. got him, tom, i shouted, rushing up. tom was holding and squeezing one of his hands with the other, and shaking it violently."
3535,8098-275181-0017.flac," and with it completely covered himself. the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest, or rather a small haycock."
3536,8098-275181-0014.flac," they savored as strongly of meiss' tom's question of bad grammar. and don't foxes catch meiss? demanded tom confidently. yes, but i don't see how that's going to catch a fox, i said."
3537,8098-275181-0018.flac," inside the nest. evidently there were mice in it, and feeling my character as fox at stake, i at once tried it forward, then crept up, and as the rustling and squeaking continued, made a pounce into the grass."
3538,8098-275181-0001.flac," to call the real mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps. this indeed is a favorite trick of rendered. at the time of my story, my friend tom edwards, ten years of age."
3539,8098-275181-0010.flac," or ruin would swallow up the poultry firm. rightly or wrongly, we attributed the mischief to a certain silver gray that had several times been seen in the neighborhood that autumn."
3540,8098-275181-0011.flac, it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks. i recollect that we set three traps for him to no purpose.
3541,8098-275181-0023.flac," made by sucking the air sharply between his teeth. ""'now be off,' said tom, and don't come poking around nor get inside till you hear me holler."""
3542,8098-275181-0015.flac," well, look here then, i'll show you,"" said he."
3543,8098-275181-0005.flac," tom thought it was the twombly boys, nefarious sam in particular. i thought it might have been an owl, but under the tree in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug, we found fox tracks."
3544,8098-275181-0008.flac, this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only 29 the next morning. there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree. this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter.
3545,8098-275181-0006.flac," and two or three ominous little wads of feathers, with one long tail feather adrift. thereupon, we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butternut, had a fit perhaps."
3546,8098-275181-0000.flac," their sharp, cur-like barks used often to rouse us. and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields, mousing around the stone heaps, making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse."
3547,8098-275181-0004.flac," the 31 had become 30, since nightfall the previous evening. it was the first one we had lost. we proceeded to look for traces. our suspicions were divided."
3548,8098-275181-0007.flac," and a casualty, such as turkey razors, are unavoidably heirs too. and we bore our laws with resignation. we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roots."
3549,8098-275181-0024.flac," and being amidst nice cozy straw, i presently went to sleep quite unintentionally. i must have slept some time, though it seemed to me, but a very few minutes. what woke me was a noise, a sharp, suppressed, yelp!"
3550,8098-275181-0032.flac," i do not think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again, however. we sold the fox skin in the village and received $13 for it, whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than $3."
3551,8098-275181-0027.flac," he said not a word, but left me to poke about and stumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near. paiky, i exclaimed, after satisfying myself that the fox was dead. some said tom."
3552,8098-275181-0012.flac," had succeeded in getting two more of the turkeys. heroes it is said are born of great crises. this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius. i'll have that fox, he said, when the traps failed."
3553,8098-275181-0028.flac, and that was all i could get from him that night. we took the fox to the house and laid it a candle. it was the silver gray. tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed.
3554,8098-275181-0025.flac, it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there. a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field.
3555,8098-275181-0022.flac, tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contents of the big basket. he then practiced squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim. his squeaks were perfect successes.
3556,8098-275181-0031.flac," i just determined to have it out with him. considering the fact that a fox is a very active, sharp-biting animal, and that this was an unusually large male, i have always thought tom got off very well."
3557,8098-275181-0033.flac," hell or by wetwiles, that fox got the turkeys out of the high-butternet is a secret."
3558,8098-275181-0002.flac," and myself were in the turkey business, equal partners. we owned a flock of 31 turkeys. these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house, in the very top of it."
3559,8098-275181-0029.flac, his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen. there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow. several minor nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab.
