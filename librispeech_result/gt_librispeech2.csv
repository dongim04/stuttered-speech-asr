0,8468-294887-0000,and with a few others devoted the most of the sabbath to their teaching when he and his brother arthur assembled the seventy anti slavery agents who were thereafter like firebrands scattered all over the land they held their meetings in this room
1,8468-294887-0001,these agents were entertained by abolitionists in the city and many of us had two or three of them in each of our families for a couple of weeks
2,8468-294887-0002,they went out all over the land and were instrumental in diffusing more truth perhaps about the dreadful system of american slavery than was accomplished in any other way he also aided in establishing several periodicals brimful of anti slavery truth
3,8468-294887-0003,among which were the anti slavery record the emancipator the slave's friend the latter to indoctrinate the children in anti slavery the american missionary society originally begun for the support of a mission in africa
4,8468-294887-0004,on the occasion of the return of the amistad captors to their native land and now doing so much for the freedmen of the south was almost entirely established by his efforts during the continuance of slavery much was done by this society
5,8468-294887-0005,the vigilance committee for aiding and befriending fugitives of which i was treasurer for many years had no better or warmer friend than he he was almost always at their meetings which were known only to the elect for we dared not hold them too publicly
6,8468-294887-0006,as we almost always had some of the travelers toward the north star present whose masters or their agents were frequently in the city in hot pursuit at first we sent them to canada but after a while sent them only to syracuse and the centre of the state
7,8468-294887-0007,in eighteen thirty four i think was the first rioting the sacking of mister tappan's house in rose street the mob brought all his furniture out and piling it up in the street set it on fire the family were absent at the time
8,8468-294887-0008,but hearing that there were a few loaded muskets there they took it out in threats but their mercantile establishment was almost ostracised at this time by the dry goods merchants
9,8468-294887-0009,and when they did so requested particularly that the bundles or boxes should not be marked from a tappan and co as was customary southern merchants especially avoided them
10,8468-294887-0010,and when two or three years later there was a general insolvency among them occasionally large losses to new york merchants and in some cases failure the tappans were saved by having no southern debts
11,8468-294887-0011,many remittances came for the help of the vigilance committee from england and scotland and at one time an extensive invoice of useful and fancy articles in several large boxes was received from the glasgow ladies sufficient to furnish a large bazaar or fair
12,8468-294887-0012,which was held in brooklyn for the benefit of the committee although lately afflicted by disease mister tappan still lives in the enjoyment of all his faculties and a good measure of health
13,8468-294887-0013,and in his advanced years sees now some of the great results of his life long efforts for the restoration and maintenance of human rights although still suffering under many of the evils which slavery has inflicted upon him the american slave no longer exists
14,8468-294887-0014,instead stands up in all our southern states the freedman knowing his rights and as a rule enjoying them original american abolitionists who met the scorn and odium the imputed shame and obloquy
15,8468-294887-0015,ye have done it unto me anthony lane new york november eighth eighteen seventy one mister lane mister tappan's personal friend who labored with him in the anti slavery cause
16,8468-294887-0016,and especially in the vigilance committee for many years from serious affection of his eyes
17,8468-294887-0017,mister tappan was therefore requested to furnish a few reminiscences from his own store house which he kindly did as follows
18,8468-294887-0018,my dear sir in answer to your request that i would furnish an article for your forthcoming book giving incidents within my personal knowledge relating to the underground rail road i have already apprized you of my illness and my consequent inability
19,8468-294887-0019,to write such an article as would be worthy of your publication however feeling somewhat relieved to day from my paralysis owing to the cheering sunshine and the favor of my almighty preserver i will try to do what i can in dictating a few anecdotes to my amanuensis
20,8468-294887-0020,which may afford you and your readers some gratification these facts i must give without reference to date as i will not tax my memory with perhaps a vain attempt to narrate them in order as mentioned in my life of arthur tappan
21,8468-294887-0021,but reflection convinced them that it was not only right to assist men in efforts to obtain their liberty when unjustly held in bondage but a duty abolitionists white and colored both in slave and free states
22,8468-294887-0022,those who had money contributed it freely and those who were destitute of money gave their time saying with the apostle silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee one
23,8468-294887-0023,i recollect that one morning on reaching my office that of the treasurer of the american missionary association my assistant told me that in the inner room were eighteen fugitives men women and children who had arrived that morning from the south in one company
24,8468-294887-0024,whom they had hired to conduct them without the limits of the city in the evening when the police force was changed they came through pennsylvania and new jersey to my office
25,8468-294887-0025,and by different agencies to canada two
26,8468-294887-0026,a missus mercy smith beckoned to me to come to her class
27,8468-294887-0027,in answer to my inquiries this girl told me the name of the southern city and the names of the persons who had held her as a slave and the mode of her escape et cetera i was walking near the water she said when a white sailor spoke to me
28,8468-294887-0028,if i would come to him in the evening i did so and was hid and fed by him and on landing at new york he conducted me to missus smith's house where i am now staying
29,8468-294887-0029,most of the teachers were warm hearted abolitionists and the whole number taught in this school during this period was seven or eight hundred
30,8468-294887-0030,to my inquiry have you parents living and also brothers and sisters she replied there is no child but myself were not your parents kind to you and did you not love them yes i love them very much
31,8468-294887-0031,how were you treated by your master and mistress they treated me very well how then said i could you put yourself in the care of that sailor who was a stranger to you and leave your parents i shall never forget her heart felt reply
32,8468-294887-0032,he told me i should be free one sunday morning i received a letter informing me that an officer belonging to savannah ga had started for new york in pursuit of two young men of nineteen or twenty
33,8468-294887-0033,and who had escaped and were supposed to be in new york the letter requested me to find them and give them warning as there was no time to be lost i concluded to go over to new york notwithstanding the doubtfulness of attempting to find them in so large a city
34,8468-294887-0034,i wrote notices to be read in the colored churches and colored sabbath schools which i delivered in person i then went to the colored school superintended
35,8468-294887-0035,i stated my errand to him with a description of the young men why said he i must have one of them in my school he took me to a class where i found one of the young men to whom i gave the needful information
36,8468-294887-0036,of savannah and that he had five children by the young man's mother who was his slave on his marriage to a white woman he sent his five colored children and their mother to auction to be sold for cash to the highest bidder
37,8468-294887-0037,on being put upon the auction block this young man addressed the bystanders and told them the circumstances of the case that his mother had long lived in the family of the doctor that it was cruel to sell her and her children
38,8468-294887-0038,and he warned the people not to bid for him for he would no longer be a slave to any man and if any one bought him he would lose his money he added i thought it right to say this i then spoke to the crowd
39,8468-294887-0039,my father said i has long been one of your first doctors and do you think it right for him to sell my mother and his children in this way i was sold and my brother also and the rest although my brother said to the crowd what i had said we soon made our escape
40,8468-294887-0040,and are now both in the city i am a blacksmith and have worked six months in one shop in new york with white journeymen not one of whom believes i suppose that i am a colored man it was not surprising for so fair was his complexion
41,8468-294887-0041,that with the aid of a brown wig after he had cut off his hair he was completely disguised he soon notified his brother who lived in another part of the city and both put themselves out of harm's way
42,8468-294887-0042,they were remarkably fine young men and it seemed a special providence that i should find them in such a large city and direct them to escape from their pursuer within one hour after i left my house in brooklyn
43,8468-295198-0000,and this was the case with mother magpie she was always full of everybody's business but her own up and down here and there everywhere but in her own nest knowing everyone's affairs telling what everybody had been doing or ought to do
44,8468-295198-0001,and ready to cast her advice gratis at every bird and beast of the woods now she bustled up to the parsonage at the top of the oak tree to tell old parson too whit what she thought he ought to preach for his next sermon and how dreadful the morals of the parish were becoming
45,8468-295198-0002,then having perfectly bewildered the poor old gentleman who was always sleepy of a monday morning mother magpie would take a peep into missus oriole's nest sit chattering on a bough above and pour forth floods of advice
46,8468-295198-0003,depend upon it my dear mother magpie would say that this way of building your nest swinging like an old empty stocking from a bough isn't at all the thing i never built one so in my life and i never have headaches
47,8468-295198-0004,now you complain always that your head aches whenever i call upon you it's all on account of this way of swinging and swaying about in such an absurd manner but my dear
48,8468-295198-0005,piped missus oriole timidly the orioles always have built in this manner and it suits our constitution a fiddle on your constitution how can you tell what agrees with your constitution unless you try you own you are not well
49,8468-295198-0006,you are subject to headaches and every physician will tell you that a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain ask old doctor kite i was talking with him about your case only yesterday and says he missus magpie i perfectly agree with you
50,8468-295198-0007,but my husband prefers this style of building that's only because he isn't properly instructed pray did you ever attend doctor kite's lectures on the nervous system no i have no time to attend lectures who would sit on the eggs
51,8468-295198-0008,o missus magpie pray don't speak to my husband he will think i've been complaining no no he won't let me alone i understand just how to say the thing i've advised hundreds of young husbands in my day and i never gave offence
52,8468-295198-0009,i say my dear if you will persist in gossiping over our private family matters with that old mother magpie my dear i don't gossip she comes and bores me to death with talking and then goes off and mistakes what she has been saying for what i said
53,8468-295198-0010,but you must cut her i try to all i can but she won't be cut it's enough to make a bird swear said tommy oriole tommy oriole to say the truth had as good a heart as ever beat under bird's feathers
54,8468-295198-0011,but then he had a weakness for concerts and general society because he was held to be by all odds the handsomest bird in the woods and sung like an angel and so the truth was he didn't confine himself so much to the domestic nest as tom titmouse or billy wren
55,8468-295198-0012,the fact is quoth tommy i am a society bird and nature has marked out for me a course beyond the range of the commonplace and my wife must learn to accommodate if she has a brilliant husband
56,8468-295198-0013,whose success gratifies her ambition and places her in a distinguished public position she must pay something for it i'm sure billy wren's wife would give her very bill to see her husband in the circles where i am quite at home to say the truth
57,8468-295198-0014,my wife was all well enough content till old mother magpie interfered it is quite my duty to take strong ground and show that i cannot be dictated to
58,8468-295198-0015,and sometimes will take the most unreasonable courses if a meddlesome magpie gets her claw into their nest but old mother magpie had now got a new business in hand in another quarter she bustled off down to water dock lane where as we said in a former narrative
59,8468-295198-0016,lived the old music teacher doctor bullfrog the poor old doctor was a simple minded good amiable creature who had played the double bass and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when
60,8468-295198-0017,latterly some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age in fact since a great city had grown up in the vicinity of the forest tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits
61,8468-295198-0018,which old mother nature had always kept up in those parts they pulled the young checkerberry before it even had time to blossom rooted up the sassafras shrubs and gnawed their roots fired off guns at the birds and on several occasions
62,8468-295198-0019,when old doctor bullfrog was leading a concert had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones this was not the worst of it the little varlets had a way of jeering at the simple old doctor and his concerts
63,8468-295198-0020,that old bullfrog was a bore and that it was time to get up a new style of music in the parish and to give the charge of it to some more modern performer
64,8468-295198-0021,poor old doctor bullfrog knew nothing of this however and was doing his simple best in peace when mother magpie called in upon him one morning well neighbour how unreasonable people are who would have thought
65,8468-295198-0022,madam said doctor bullfrog with all that energy of tone for which he was remarkable i don't believe it i can't believe it you must have made a mistake
66,8468-295198-0023,no no my good friend i never make mistakes what i know i know certainly
67,8468-295198-0024,and nancy nibble who are married this very day i knew that thing six weeks before any bird or beast in our parts and i can tell you you are going to be scandalously and ungratefully treated doctor bullfrog
68,8468-295198-0025,bless me we shall all be ruined said missus bullfrog my poor husband oh as to that if you take things in time and listen to my advice said mother magpie we may yet pull you through you must alter your style a little
69,8468-295198-0026,adapt it to modern times everybody now is a little touched with the operatic fever and there's tommy oriole has been to new orleans and brought back a touch of the artistic if you would try his style a little something tyrolean you see
70,8468-295198-0027,dear madam consider my voice i never could hit the high notes how do you know it's all practice tommy oriole says so just try the scales as to your voice your manner of living has a great deal to do with it
71,8468-295198-0028,i always did tell you that your passion for water injured your singing suppose tommy oriole should sit half his days up to his hips in water as you do his voice would be as hoarse and rough as yours come up on the bank and learn to perch as we birds do
72,8468-295198-0029,we are the true musical race and so poor mister bullfrog was persuaded to forego his pleasant little cottage under the cat tails where his green spectacles and honest round back had excited even in the minds of the boys sentiments of respect and compassion
73,8468-295198-0030,he came up into the garden and established himself under a burdock and began to practise italian scales the result was that poor old doctor bullfrog instead of being considered as a respectable old bore
74,8468-295198-0031,got himself universally laughed at for aping fashionable manners every bird and beast in the forest had a gibe at him and even old parson too whit thought it worth his while to make him a pastoral call
75,8468-295198-0032,and admonish him about courses unbefitting his age and standing as to mother magpie you may be sure that she assured every one how sorry she was that dear old doctor bullfrog had made such a fool of himself
76,8468-295198-0033,but the tragedy for the poor old music teacher grew even more melancholy in its termination for one day as he was sitting disconsolately under a currant bush in the garden practising his poor old notes in a quiet way thump
77,8468-286673-0000,the slow little mud turtle when the twenty little mud turtles broke their egg shells one hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops
78,8468-286673-0001,the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank near by said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them
79,8468-286673-0002,and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters i'm coming in a minute the other little turtles waited but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail
80,8468-286673-0003,and talked a while with him come on said the biggest little turtle don't let's wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together
81,8468-286673-0004,and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed to quite as though he were out of patience about something why didn't you turtles wait for me
82,8468-286673-0005,you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch
83,8468-286673-0006,the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well the mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neck skin she was so eager to see them all
84,8468-286673-0007,why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle who was trying to make a place for himself on the log they didn't wait for me he said i was coming right along but they wouldn't wait i think they are just as mea
85,8468-286673-0008,the mother turtle raised one of her forefeet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said
86,8468-286673-0009,i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad
87,8468-286673-0010,yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side
88,8468-286673-0011,the first year i had only a few children the next year i had more and so it has gone every year a few more children than the year before until now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always one slow little turtle
89,8468-286673-0012,who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him that makes him miss his share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody else's fault the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes
90,8468-286673-0013,and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell side walls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell
91,8468-286673-0014,i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sad very very sad
92,8468-286673-0015,and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not have him with us long
93,8468-286673-0016,i remember so well my first slow child and how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her forefeet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water
94,8468-286673-0017,the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them
95,8468-286673-0018,or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises
96,8468-286673-0019,and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher back shells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water
97,8468-286673-0020,and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond
98,8468-286673-0021,their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their rounded up back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black
99,8468-286673-0022,she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their webbed feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them
100,8468-286673-0023,yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all
101,8468-286673-0024,she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw two terrible great two legged animals wading into the pond from the shore boys she cried boys and she sprawled off the end of her log
102,8468-286673-0025,and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle
103,8468-286673-0026,then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and rapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes
104,8468-286673-0027,next the other great animal took him and turned him over and rapped on his shells and stared at him
105,8468-286673-0028,he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass
106,8468-286673-0029,he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell
107,8468-286673-0030,this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go
108,8468-286673-0031,then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night
109,8468-286673-0032,i wish i might help you some time
110,8468-286673-0033,i'm here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you i'm not hungry he murmured
111,8468-286673-0034,and again he fell fast asleep
112,8468-286673-0035,but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept
113,8468-286673-0036,does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i am so glad to get back i'll never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his
114,8468-286673-0037,if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that
115,8468-286673-0038,he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there
116,8468-286673-0039,he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot
117,8468-286673-0040,and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle
118,445-123860-0000,tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd when not to be receives reproach of being and the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd not by our feeling but by others seeing
119,445-123860-0001,for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood or on my frailties why are frailer spies which in their wills count bad what i think good
120,445-123860-0002,no i am that i am and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
121,445-123860-0003,by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain all men are bad and in their badness reign
122,445-123860-0004,which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date even to eternity or at the least so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist
123,445-123860-0005,thy record never can be miss'd that poor retention could not so much hold nor need i tallies thy dear love to score therefore to give them from me was i bold
124,445-123860-0006,they are but dressings of a former sight our dates are brief and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told
125,445-123860-0007,thy registers and thee i both defy not wondering at the present nor the past for thy records and what we see doth lie
126,445-123860-0008,it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent
127,445-123860-0009,it fears not policy that heretic which works on leases of short number'd hours but all alone stands hugely politic that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers to this i witness call
128,445-123860-0010,the fools of time which die for goodness who have lived for crime
129,445-123860-0011,were't aught to me i bore the canopy with my extern the outward honouring or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining
130,445-123860-0012,have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet forgoing simple savour pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent no
131,445-123860-0013,let me be obsequious in thy heart and take thou my oblation poor but free which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art but mutual render only me for thee hence thou suborned informer

133,445-123860-0015,o thou my lovely boy who in thy power dost hold time's fickle glass his fickle hour who hast by waning grown
134,445-123860-0016,if nature sovereign mistress over wrack as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back she keeps thee to this purpose
135,445-123860-0017,but now is black beauty's successive heir and beauty slander'd with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on nature's power fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face
136,445-123860-0018,sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower but is profan'd if not lives in disgrace
137,445-123860-0019,and they mourners seem at such who not born fair no beauty lack sland'ring creation with a false esteem yet so they mourn
138,445-123860-0020,whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand to be so tickled they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait

142,445-123860-0024,if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damask'd red and white
143,445-123860-0025,but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak
144,445-123860-0026,yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
145,445-123857-0000,some glory in their birth some in their skill some in their wealth some in their body's force some in their garments though new fangled ill
146,445-123857-0001,some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure
147,445-123857-0002,all these i better in one general best thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
148,445-123857-0003,since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
149,445-123857-0004,happy to have thy love happy to die
150,445-123857-0005,thy looks with me thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change
151,445-123857-0006,in many's looks the false heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
152,445-123857-0007,whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
153,445-123857-0008,how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
154,445-123857-0009,and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone
155,445-123857-0010,they rightly do inherit heaven's graces and husband nature's riches from expense they are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence
156,445-123857-0011,the summer's flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed
157,445-123857-0012,outbraves his dignity for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
158,445-123857-0013,which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
159,445-123857-0014,that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report
160,445-123857-0015,o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beauty's veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see
161,445-123857-0016,take heed dear heart of this large privilege
162,445-123857-0017,some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less
163,445-123857-0018,what old december's bareness everywhere and yet this time removed was summer's time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime
164,445-123857-0019,like widow'd wombs after their lords decease yet this abundant issue seem'd to me but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
165,445-123857-0020,and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
166,445-123857-0021,from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april dress'd in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
167,445-123857-0022,yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summer's story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
168,445-123857-0023,nor did i wonder at the lily's white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those
169,445-123857-0024,yet seem'd it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play
170,445-123857-0025,the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my love's breath
171,445-123857-0026,the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd
172,445-123857-0027,the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stol'n of both and to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
173,445-123857-0028,but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death
174,445-123857-0029,where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
175,445-123857-0030,darkening thy power to lend base subjects light return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent
176,445-123857-0031,sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument
177,445-123857-0032,my love's sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay
178,6000-86686-0000,well well but the darkness of mankind is untollable well sir you must know as you didn't hear it afore that there was a king
179,6000-86686-0001,and it was he that owned the churches in the early days the king you see was the right sort he was the real boy and loved sport as he loved his life and hunting in particular and from the rising o the sun up he got and away he went over the mountains after the deer
180,6000-86686-0002,and thinking of drowning himself that could get no diversion in life when all of a sudden turning round the corner
181,6000-86686-0003,god save you kindly king o'toole says the young man true for you says the king i am king o'toole says he prince and plennypennytinchery of these parts says he but how came ye to know that says he oh never mind says saint kavin
182,6000-86686-0004,you see it was saint kavin sure enough the saint himself in disguise and nobody else oh never mind says he i know more than that
183,6000-86686-0005,blur an agers how came ye to know about my goose says the king oh no matter i was given to understand it says saint kavin after some more talk the king says what are you i'm an honest man says saint kavin well honest man says the king
184,6000-86686-0006,and how is it you make your money so aisy
185,6000-86686-0007,is it a tinker you are says the king no says the saint i'm no tinker by trade king o'toole
186,6000-86686-0008,says he what would you say says he if i made your old goose as good as new my dear at the word of making his goose as good as new you'd think the poor old king's eyes were ready to jump out of his head
187,6000-86686-0009,with that the king whistled and down came the poor goose just like a hound waddling up to the poor cripple her master and as like him as two peas the minute the saint clapt his eyes on the goose i'll do the job for you says he king o'toole
188,6000-86686-0010,by jaminee says king o'toole if you do i'll say you're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes oh by dad says saint kavin
189,6000-86686-0011,says he as to repair your old goose for nothing what'll you gi me if i do the job for you that's the chat says saint kavin i'll give you whatever you ask says the king isn't that fair
190,6000-86686-0012,says the saint that's the way to do business now
191,6000-86686-0013,this is the bargain i'll make with you king o'toole will you gi me all the ground the goose flies over the first offer after i make her as good as new i will says the king you won't go back o your word says saint kavin
192,6000-86686-0014,honour bright says king o'toole holding out his fist honour bright says saint kavin back again it's a bargain come here says he to the poor old goose
193,6000-86686-0015,and it's i that'll make you the sporting bird with that my dear he took up the goose by the two wings
194,6000-86686-0016,and throwing her up in the air whew says he jist givin her a blast to help her and with that my jewel she took to her heels flyin like one o the eagles themselves and cutting as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain
195,6000-86686-0017,looking at his poor old goose flying as light as a lark and better than ever she was
196,6000-86686-0018,says saint kavin for making her the like by jabers says the king i say nothing beats the art o man barring the bees and do you say no more nor that says saint kavin and that i'm beholden to you says the king
197,6000-86686-0019,i will says king o'toole and you're welcome to it says he though it's the last acre i have to give but you'll keep your word true says the saint as true as the sun says the king it's well for you king o'toole that you said that word says he
198,6000-86686-0020,when the king was as good as his word saint kavin was pleased with him and then it was that he made himself known to the king and says he king o'toole you're a decent man for i only came here to try you you don't know me says he because i'm disguised musha
199,6000-86686-0021,then says the king who are you i'm saint kavin said the saint blessing himself oh queen of heaven says the king making the sign of the cross between his eyes and falling down on his knees before the saint is it the great saint kavin says he
200,6000-86686-0022,that i've been discoursing all this time without knowing it says he
201,6000-86686-0023,and so you're a saint says the king i am says saint kavin by jabers i thought i was only talking to a dacent boy says the king well you know the difference now says the saint i'm saint kavin says he the greatest of all the saints
202,6000-86686-0024,and so the king had his goose as good as new to divert him as long as he lived and the saint supported him after he came into his property as i told you until the day of his death and that was soon after for the poor goose thought he was catching a trout one friday
203,6000-86686-0025,but my jewel it was a mistake he made and instead of a trout it was a thieving horse eel and instead of the goose killing a trout for the king's supper by dad the eel killed the king's goose and small blame to him
204,6000-55211-0000,chapter sixteen a girl and a bit of lowestoft immediately after breakfast the next morning billy was summoned to the telephone oh good morning uncle william she called in answer to the masculine voice that replied to her hullo
205,6000-55211-0001,billy are you very busy this morning no indeed not if you want me well i do my dear uncle william's voice was troubled i want you to go with me if you can to see a missus greggory she's got a teapot i want
206,6000-55211-0002,it's a genuine lowestoft harlow says will you go of course i will what time eleven if you can at park street she's at the west end
207,6000-55211-0003,harlow says others will have to know of it of course you see she's just made up her mind to sell it and asked him to find a customer i wouldn't trouble you but he says they're peculiar the daughter especially and may need some careful handling that's why i wanted you
208,6000-55211-0004,though i wanted you to see the tea pot too
209,6000-55211-0005,that she was one day to be mistress of the strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her i'd love to see it and i'll come gladly but i'm afraid i won't be much help uncle william she worried i'll take the risk of that
210,6000-55211-0006,why how funny well i'll come at eleven you say at park street yes and thank you my dear i tried to get kate to go too but she wouldn't by the way i'm going to bring you home to luncheon kate leaves this afternoon you know
211,6000-55211-0007,and it's been so snowy she hasn't thought best to try to get over to the house maybe aunt hannah would come too for luncheon would she i'm afraid not returned billy with a rueful laugh she's got three shawls on this morning
212,6000-55211-0008,i'll tell her though and i'll see you at eleven finished billy as she hung up the receiver promptly at the appointed time billy met uncle william at park street and together they set out for the west end street named on the paper in his pocket
213,6000-55211-0009,but when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown i declare billy i'm not sure but we'd better turn back he fretted i didn't mean to take you to such a place as this billy shivered a little
214,6000-55211-0010,nonsense uncle william of course you won't turn back
215,6000-55211-0011,she finished just above her breath missus greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs up which william henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing
216,6000-55211-0012,billy really i think we should turn back but billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes she was missus greggory yes she was even as she uttered the words
217,6000-55211-0013,however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion missus greggory was a cripple her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches
218,6000-55211-0014,both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one billy's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay
219,6000-55211-0015,mechanically she had taken the chair toward which missus greggory had motioned her she had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain
220,6000-55211-0016,missus greggory had seated herself now and william henshaw had cleared his throat nervously
221,6000-55211-0017,we er i came from harlow missus greggory he gave me to understand you had an er teapot that er with his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table william henshaw came to a helpless pause
222,6000-55211-0018,a curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed missus greggory's face terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy relief in the end conquered
223,6000-55211-0019,though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke the lowestoft yes i'm so glad that is of course i must be glad i'll get it her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair
224,6000-55211-0020,there was only despairing sorrow on her face now the man rose at once
225,6000-55211-0021,what a beauty missus greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy in tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design
226,6000-55211-0022,near it set a tray like plate of the same ware and decoration if you'll lift it down please yourself motioned missus greggory i don't like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side
227,6000-55211-0023,with fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot his eyes sparkled billy look what a beauty and it's a lowestoft too the real thing the genuine true soft paste
228,6000-55211-0024,and there's the tray did you notice he exulted turning back to the shelf you don't see that every day they get separated most generally you know these pieces have been in our family for generations said missus greggory with an accent of pride
229,6000-55211-0025,you'll find them quite perfect i think perfect i should say they were cried the man they are then valuable missus greggory's voice shook indeed they are but you must know that
230,6000-55211-0026,i have been told so yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association my mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir again her voice broke william henshaw cleared his throat but
231,6000-55211-0027,madam if you do not wish to sell he stopped abruptly his longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china missus greggory gave a low cry but i do that is i must
232,6000-55211-0028,and that it will bring in money and we need money she threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks i can't do much at work that pays i sew she nodded toward the machine by the window
233,6000-55211-0029,but with only one foot to make it go you see the other is
234,6000-55211-0030,she finished with a wistful whimsicality billy turned away sharply there was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes she was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot
235,6000-55211-0031,or against uncle william for wanting the teapot or for not wanting it if he did not buy it and so you see i do very much wish to sell missus greggory said then perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously
236,6000-55211-0032,the collector's eyes glowed he picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it then he turned to the tray after a moment he spoke i have only one other in my collection as rare he said
237,6000-55211-0033,i paid a hundred dollars for that i shall be glad to give you the same for this madam missus greggory started visibly a hundred dollars so much as that she cried almost joyously
238,6000-55211-0034,brought of course if it's worth that to you she paused suddenly a quick step had sounded in the hall outside the next moment the door flew open
239,6000-55211-0035,mother only think i've she stopped and drew back a little her startled eyes went from one face to another then dropped to the lowestoft teapot in the man's hands her expression changed at once she shut the door quickly and hurried forward
240,6000-55211-0036,mother what is it who are these people she asked sharply billy lifted her chin the least bit she was conscious of a feeling which she could not name billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice
241,6000-55211-0037,william henshaw too raised his chin he also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people my name is henshaw miss greggory i presume he said quietly i was sent here by mister harlow
242,6000-55211-0038,stammered missus greggory wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation this gentleman says he will be glad to buy it er my daughter alice mister henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and miss
243,6000-55211-0039,neilson supplied the man as she looked at billy and hesitated a swift red stained alice greggory's face with barely an acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother yes dear but that won't be necessary now
244,6000-55211-0040,as i started to tell you when i came in i have two new pupils and so turning to the man again i thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present
245,6000-55211-0041,william henshaw frowned angrily that was the man but his eyes the collector's eyes sought the teapot longingly before either the man or the collector could speak however missus greggory interposed quick words of remonstrance
246,6000-55211-0042,but alice my dear she almost sobbed you didn't wait to let me tell you
247,6000-55211-0043,he will give us a hundred dollars a hundred dollars echoed the girl faintly
248,6000-55211-0044,billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass
249,6000-55211-0045,billy was wondering which she herself desired more that uncle william should buy the lowestoft or that he should not she knew she wished missus greggory to have the hundred dollars there was no doubt on that point then uncle william spoke
250,6000-55211-0046,and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp i am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly i certainly should not have made it had i not had missus greggory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot
251,6000-55211-0047,alice greggory turned as if stung wished to sell she repeated the words with superb disdain she was plainly very angry her blue gray eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair
252,6000-55211-0048,do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she's treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing alice
253,6000-55211-0049,i can't help it stormed the girl hotly i know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother's i know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all and then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it
254,6000-55211-0050,perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darned and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes alice gasped missus greggory in dismayed horror
255,6000-55211-0051,with a little outward fling of her two hands alice greggory stepped back her face had grown white again i beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet i should not have spoken so
256,6000-55211-0052,you are very kind mister henshaw but i do not think we care to sell the lowestoft to day both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh william henshaw picked up his hat his face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do
257,6000-55211-0053,or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something during the brief minute that he hesitated however billy sprang forward missus greggory please won't you let me buy the teapot
258,6000-55211-0054,and then won't you keep it for me here i haven't the hundred dollars with me but i'll send it right away you will let me do it won't you it was an impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness
259,6000-55211-0055,but it was one that might be expected perhaps from billy missus greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking dear child she reached out and caught billy's hand in both her own
260,6000-55211-0056,even while she shook her head in denial not so her daughter alice greggory flushed scarlet she drew herself proudly erect thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us
261,6000-55211-0057,we prefer them infinitely to charity oh but please i didn't mean you didn't understand faltered billy for answer alice greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it open oh alice my dear pleaded missus greggory again feebly
262,6000-55211-0058,come billy we'll bid you good morning ladies said william henshaw then decisively and billy with a little wistful pat on missus greggory's clasped hands went once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk
263,6000-55211-0059,william henshaw drew a long breath well by jove billy the next time i take you curio hunting it won't be to this place he fumed wasn't it awful choked billy awful
264,6000-55211-0060,the girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss i ever saw i didn't want her old lowestoft if she didn't want to sell it but to practically invite me there and then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger
265,6000-55211-0061,still i was sorry for the poor little old lady i wish somehow she could have that hundred dollars it was the man who said this not the collector so do i rejoined billy dolefully
266,831-130746-0000,the ostler being a fool rushed violently down the road vociferating after them then he returned panting to the vicuna hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was up stopped to give them the cream of the adventure
267,831-130746-0001,that gave the fugitives five minutes then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the barmaid what the matter was and the gov'nor being out they spent some more precious time wondering what ever was to be done
268,831-130746-0002,there were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions there were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse that made ten minutes
269,831-130746-0003,then stephen the waiter who had shown hoopdriver up came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question which that turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour and in the midst of this discussion
270,831-130746-0004,making a sudden and awestricken silence appeared bechamel in the hall beyond the bar walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and passed out of sight you conceive the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium
271,831-130746-0005,incredulous eyes stared into one another's in the bar as his paces muffled by the stair carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead
272,831-130746-0006,it wasn't that one at all miss said the ostler i'd swear well that's mister beaumont said the barmaid anyhow their conversation hung comatose in the air switched up by bechamel
273,831-130746-0007,they listened together his feet stopped turned went out of the diningroom down the passage to the bedroom stopped again poor chap said the barmaid she's a wicked woman sssh said stephen
274,831-130746-0008,after a pause bechamel went back to the dining room they heard a chair creak under him interlude of conversational eyebrows i'm going up said stephen to break the melancholy news to him bechamel looked up from a week old newspaper
275,831-130746-0009,as without knocking stephen entered bechamel's face suggested a different expectation beg pardon sir said stephen with a diplomatic cough well said bechamel wondering suddenly if jessie had kept some of her threats
276,831-130746-0010,if so he was in for an explanation but he had it ready she was a monomaniac leave me alone with her he would say i know how to calm her missus beaumont said stephen well has gone
277,831-130746-0011,he rose with a fine surprise gone he said with a half laugh gone sir on her bicycle on her bicycle why she went sir with another gentleman this time bechamel was really startled
278,831-130746-0012,an other gentlemen who another gentleman in brown sir went into the yard sir got out the two bicycles sir and went off sir about twenty minutes ago bechamel stood with his eyes round and his knuckle on his hips
279,831-130746-0013,but as yet he seemed merely stunned brown clothes he said and fairish a little like yourself sir in the dark the ostler sir jim duke
280,831-130746-0014,then with infinite fervour he said but let us put in blank cartridge he said i might have thought he flung himself into the armchair damn her said bechamel for all the world like a common man
281,831-130746-0015,i'll chuck this infernal business they've gone eigh yessir
282,831-130746-0016,making a memorable saying let em go who cares and i wish him luck and bring me some bourbon as fast as you can there's a good chap
283,831-130746-0017,stephen was too surprised to say anything but bourbon sir go on said bechamel damn you stephen's sympathies changed at once yessir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marvelling
284,831-130746-0018,she had evidently gone off with him and that little business was over and he was here stranded and sold
285,831-130746-0019,and his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all that the girl had escaped through her stepmother in which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed
286,831-130746-0020,knickerbockers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies he started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths
287,831-130746-0021,he banged the arms of the chair with his fist and swore again
288,831-130746-0022,i bechamel when with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door stephen entered with the bourbon
289,831-130746-0023,the moonlight ride and so the twenty minutes law passed into an infinity
290,831-130746-0024,the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the vicuna hotel we leave all bognor as we have left all chichester
291,831-130746-0025,and midhurst and haslemere and guildford and ripley and putney and follow this dear fool of a hoopdriver of ours and his young lady in grey out upon the moonlight road how they rode
292,831-130746-0026,how their hearts beat together and their breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursuit for all that flight mister hoopdriver was in the world of romance had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit
293,831-130746-0027,hoopdriver had cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born had bechamel arisen in the way with rapiers for a duel hoopdriver had fought as one to whom agincourt was a reality and drapery a dream
294,831-130746-0028,it was rescue elopement glory and she by the side of him he had seen her face in shadow
295,831-130746-0029,he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears but what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon the road turned northward going round through the outskirts of bognor
296,831-130746-0030,then amidst villas again some warm and lamplit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw broad wan meadows shrouded in a low lying mist
297,831-130746-0031,they scarcely heeded whither they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewy night pale and intricate and high
298,831-130746-0032,at a footfall at a roughness in the road she seemed to be too intent upon escape to give much thought to him
299,831-130746-0033,his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position the night was a warm white silence save for the subtile running of their chains
300,831-130746-0034,he looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankles gracefully ruling the treadles now the road turned westward and she was a dark grey outline against the shimmer of the moon
301,831-130746-0035,and now they faced northwards and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and cheek there is a magic quality in moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden
302,831-130746-0036,it has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy route
303,831-130746-0037,white dust hot underfoot blinding to the eye is now a soft grey silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence
304,831-130746-0038,she who has spiritualised the world alone save for two attendant steady shining stars and in silence under her benign influence under the benediction of her light rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night
305,831-130746-0039,nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mister hoopdriver's skull at the turnings of the road he made his decisions with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard the right he would say or again
306,831-130746-0040,the left as one who knew so it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea
307,831-130746-0041,hullo said mister hoopdriver sotto voce they dismounted abruptly stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side
308,831-130746-0042,you are safe said mister hoopdriver sweeping off his cap with an air and bowing courtly where are we safe but where chichester harbour he waved his arm seaward as though it was a goal do you think they will follow us
309,831-130746-0043,we have turned and turned again it seemed to hoopdriver that he heard her sob she stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath
310,831-130746-0044,are you tired he asked i will do what has to be done the two black figures in the broken light were silent for a space do you know she said i am not afraid of you i am sure you are honest to me
311,831-130746-0045,he was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic it's an ugly name he said but you are right in trusting me i would i would do anything for you this
312,831-130746-0046,promised to help and protect me i was unhappy at home never mind why a stepmother idle unoccupied hindered cramped that is enough perhaps then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire
313,831-130746-0047,to be a human being not a thing in a hutch and he i know said hoopdriver and now here i am i will do anything said hoopdriver she thought you cannot imagine my stepmother no i could not describe her
314,831-130746-0048,i am entirely at your service i will help you with all my power i have lost an illusion and found a knight errant she spoke of bechamel as the illusion mister hoopdriver felt flattered but he had no adequate answer
315,831-130746-0049,what we had best be doing you are tired you know and we can't wander all night after the day we've had that was chichester we were near she asked if he meditated with a tremble in his voice
316,831-130746-0050,you would make me your brother miss beaumont yes we could stop there together she took a minute to answer i am going to light these lamps said hoopdriver he bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe
317,831-130746-0051,grave and intent how could she ever have thought him common or absurd but you must tell me your name brother she said er carrington said mister hoopdriver after a momentary pause
318,831-130746-0052,who would be hoopdriver on a night like this but the christian name christian name my christian name well chris he snapped his lamp and stood up if you will hold my machine i will light yours he said
319,831-130746-0053,the mute emotion of his face affected her strangely she had to speak
320,831-130746-0054,she said with a laugh to break the intensity he opened his mouth and shut it again and with a sudden wincing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine she looked down at him
321,831-130746-0055,almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes it was as i have indicated the hour and season of the full moon
322,831-130746-0056,and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converge thereupon that chichester was at last attained it seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the red hotel still glowed yellow and warm
323,831-130746-0057,but that night he was in the mood to dare anything so you found your young lady at last said the ostler of the red hotel
324,831-130746-0058,quite a misunderstanding said hoopdriver with splendid readiness my sister had gone to bognor but i brought her back here i've took a fancy to this place and the moonlight's simply dee vine we've had supper thenks and we're tired said mister hoopdriver
325,831-130746-0059,i suppose you won't take anything jessie the glory of having her even as a sister and to call her jessie like that but he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit good night sis he said and pleasant dreams
326,831-130746-0060,but this was living indeed he told himself
327,831-130739-0000,the principal character in the story if you presuming you are of the sex that does such things if you had gone into the drapery emporium which is really only magnificent for shop
328,831-130739-0001,a perfectly fictitious co by the bye of putney on the fourteenth of august eighteen ninety five had turned to the right hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend
329,831-130739-0002,you might have been served by the central figure of this story that is now beginning he would have come forward bowing and swaying
330,831-130739-0003,what he might have the pleasure of showing you under certain circumstances as for instance hats baby linen gloves silks lace or curtains
331,831-130739-0004,and making a kind of circular sweep invited you to step this way and so led you beyond his ken
332,831-130739-0005,huckaback blankets dimity cretonne linen calico are cases in point
333,831-130739-0006,under which happier circumstances you might if of an observing turn of mind and not too much of a housewife to be inhuman have given the central figure of this story less cursory attention
334,831-130739-0007,now if you had noticed anything about him it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable he wore the black morning coat the black tie and the speckled grey nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft
335,831-130739-0008,hair of a kind of dirty fairness greyish eyes and a skimpy immature moustache under his peaked indeterminate nose his features were all small but none ill shaped a rosette of pins decorated the lappel of his coat
336,831-130739-0009,we could show you something better of course no trouble madam i assure you such were the simple counters of his intercourse so i say
337,831-130739-0010,he would have danced about behind the counter have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you have put on one side those you selected extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tinfoil sheet from a fixture
338,831-130739-0011,made you out a little bill in that weak flourishing hand peculiar to drapers
339,831-130739-0012,sayn then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view
340,831-130739-0013,have scribbled a still more flourishing j m all over the document have asked you if there was nothing more have stood by you supposing that you were paying cash until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change
341,831-130739-0014,one glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilities at work all about you
342,831-130739-0015,but real literature as distinguished from anecdote does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone literature is revelation modern literature is indecorous revelation
343,831-130739-0016,it is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen even at the cost of some blushes and the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story
344,831-130739-0017,the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was let us face it bravely the remarkable condition of this young man's legs let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness
345,831-130739-0018,let us assume something of the scientific spirit the hard almost professorial tone of the conscientious realist let us treat this young man's legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest with the unemotional
346,831-130739-0019,and so to our revelation on the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed ladies and gentlemen a contusion and an abrasion on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contusion also
347,831-130739-0020,on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise on his left shin there were two bruises one a leaden yellow graduating here and there into purple and another obviously of more recent date of a blotchy red
348,831-130739-0021,tumid and threatening proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner an unnatural hardness and redness would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf
349,831-130739-0022,and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points
350,831-130739-0023,the right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee so far we may proceed with our details
351,831-130739-0024,fired by these discoveries an investigator might perhaps have pursued his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders elbows and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story
352,831-130739-0025,he had indeed been bumped and battered at an extraordinary number of points but enough of realistic description is as good as a feast
353,831-130739-0026,even in literature one must know where to draw the line now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shopman
354,831-130739-0027,one might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a threshing machine say or one of those hay making furies but sherlock holmes
355,831-130739-0028,would have fancied nothing of the kind
356,831-130739-0029,considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the mounting beginner upon the bicycling saddle and that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent
357,831-130739-0030,of the concussions attendant on that person's hasty frequently causeless and invariably ill conceived descents one large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist
358,831-130739-0031,for upon every one of them waits the jest of the unexpected treadle you try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and whack you are rubbing your shin so out of innocence we ripen
359,831-130739-0032,two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in learning such as one might expect in a person unused to muscular exercise blisters on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering rider and so forth
360,831-130739-0033,until sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old fashioned affair with a fork instead of the diamond frame a cushioned tire well worn on the hind wheel
361,831-130739-0034,rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from roehampton to putney hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel
362,831-130739-0035,a gasping and grunting a shouting of steer man steer a wavering unsteady flight a spasmodic turning of the missile edifice of man and machine and a collapse then you descry dimly through the dusk
363,831-130739-0036,thus even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself and drive him against all the conditions of his calling against the counsels of prudence and the restrictions of his means
364,831-130739-0037,to seek the wholesome delights of exertion and danger and pain and our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man to which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end
365,831-130739-0038,but enough of these revelations the central figure of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be packed by the senior porter and sent to you
366,831-130739-0039,and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins to straighten them punctiliously near him is an apprentice apprenticed to the same high calling of draper's assistant
367,831-130739-0040,a ruddy red haired lad in a very short tailless black coat and a very high collar who is deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of cretonne
368,831-130739-0041,the assistant is dreaming of the delicious time only four hours off now when he will resume the tale of his bruises and abrasions the apprentice is nearer the long long thoughts of boyhood and his imagination rides cap a pie
369,831-130739-0042,through the chambers of his brain seeking some knightly quest in honour of that fair lady the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dress making upstairs
370,831-130739-0043,he inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand the apprentice becomes extremely active
371,831-130739-0044,they're going fairly well sir
372,831-130739-0045,the shop walker brings up parallel to the counter any particular time when you want your holidays he asks hoopdriver pulls at his skimpy moustache no don't want them too late sir of course
373,831-130739-0046,how about this day week hoopdriver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the corners of the gingham folds in his hands his face is eloquent of conflicting considerations can he learn it in a week that's the question
374,831-130739-0047,otherwise briggs will get next week and he will have to wait until september when the weather is often uncertain he is naturally of a sanguine disposition
375,831-130739-0048,all drapers have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you the decision comes at last
376,831-130739-0049,the next in the strict scale of precedence of the drapery emporium mister hoopdriver in alternating spasms anon straightens his gingham and anon becomes meditative with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom tooth
377,831-130739-0050,at supper that night holiday talk held undisputed sway mister pritchard spoke of scotland miss isaacs clamoured of bettws
378,831-130739-0051,i said hoopdriver when the question came to him why cycling of course you're never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours day after day said miss howe of the costume department i am
379,831-130739-0052,said hoopdriver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient moustache
380,831-130739-0053,you stow it said mister hoopdriver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt
381,831-130739-0054,i'm getting fairly safe upon it now he told miss howe at other times hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity
382,831-130739-0055,when the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and very big place and studying a road map of the south of england
383,831-130739-0056,was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark briggs had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt hoopdriver's inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him have the machine thoroughly well oiled said briggs
384,831-130739-0057,carry one or two lemons with you don't tear yourself to death the first day and sit upright never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity you mind those things and nothing very much can't happen to you hoopdriver you take my word
385,831-130739-0058,save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe and then break out with an entirely different set of tips avoid running over dogs hoopdriver whatever you do
386,831-130739-0059,never let the machine buckle there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling don't scorch don't ride on the foot path keep your own side of the road and if you see a tramline go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county
387,831-130739-0060,and always light up before dark you mind just a few little things like that hoopdriver and nothing much can't happen to you you take my word right you are said hoopdriver good night old man good night said briggs
388,831-130739-0061,hoopdriver rode off into dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again something what was it never oil the steering it's fatal
389,831-130739-0062,a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying and clean the chain daily with black lead you mind just a few little things like that
390,1963-142776-0000,crayfish soup
391,1963-142776-0001,one quarter pounds of butter six anchovies
392,1963-142776-0002,a little lobster spawn seasoning to taste two quarts of medium stock
393,1963-142776-0003,mode shell the crayfish and put the fish between two plates until they are wanted pound the shells in a mortar with the butter and anchovies when well beaten add a pint of stock and simmer for three quarters of an hour
394,1963-142776-0004,after it has been rubbed through the tammy if necessary add seasoning time
395,1963-142776-0005,this is one of those fishes that were highly esteemed by the ancients the greeks preferred it when brought from alexandria and the romans ate it boiled with cumin and seasoned with pepper and other condiments
396,1963-142776-0006,a recipe tells us that crayfish can be preserved several days in baskets with fresh grass such as the nettle or in a bucket with about three eighths of an inch of water more water would kill them
397,1963-142776-0007,because the large quantity of air they require necessitates the water in which they are kept to be continually renewed eel soup
398,1963-142776-0008,three blades of mace one bunch of sweet herbs one quarter oz of peppercorns salt to taste
399,1963-142776-0009,let them simmer for a few minutes then pour the water to them and add the onion cut in thin slices the herbs mace and seasoning simmer till the eels are tender but do not break the fish take them out carefully
400,1963-142776-0010,mix the flour smoothly to a batter with the cream bring it to a boil pour over the eels and serve time

415,1963-142776-0025,from some lines of oppian it would appear that the ancients were ignorant that the oyster is generally found adhering to rocks the starfish is one of the most deadly enemies of these bivalves the poet says
416,1963-142776-0026,the prickly star creeps on with full deceit to force the oyster from his close retreat when gaping lids their widen'd void display the watchful star thrusts in a pointed ray of all its treasures spoils the rifled case

424,1963-142776-0034,this little fish bears a striking resemblance to the shrimp but is neither so common nor so small
425,1963-142393-0000,adam understood dinah's haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it
426,1963-142393-0001,i wish i'd asked her to write to me though he thought and yet
427,1963-142393-0002,she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while and i've no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes she's told me what her mind is and she's not a woman to say one thing and mean another
428,1963-142393-0003,i'll wait patiently that was adam's wise resolution and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got
429,1963-142393-0004,but towards the middle of october the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion the weeks were unusually long dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind
430,1963-142393-0005,he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second he treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties
431,1963-142393-0006,but that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us adam was no longer so confident as he had been he began to fear that perhaps dinah's old life
432,1963-142393-0007,would have too strong a grasp upon her
433,1963-142393-0008,if she had not felt this she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him as adam's confidence waned his patience waned with it
434,1963-142393-0009,and he thought he must write himself he must ask dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful he sat up late one night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect
435,1963-142393-0010,it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips for her presence reconciled him to her will you perceive how it was adam was hungering for the sight of dinah
436,1963-142393-0011,and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn but what harm could he do by going to snowfield dinah could not be displeased with him for it
437,1963-142393-0012,she had not forbidden him to go she must surely expect that he would go before long by the second sunday in october
438,1963-142393-0013,that he was already on his way to snowfield on horseback this time for his hours were precious now and he had borrowed jonathan burge's good nag for the journey what keen memories went along the road with him
439,1963-142393-0014,he had often been to oakbourne and back since that first journey to snowfield but beyond oakbourne the greystone walls the broken country the meagre trees seemed to be telling him afresh
440,1963-142393-0015,the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time or rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters and adam
441,1963-142393-0016,this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey country thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past that is a base
442,1963-142393-0017,and selfish even a blasphemous spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves
443,1963-142393-0018,adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank god for another's misery and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy in adam's behalf
444,1963-142393-0019,i should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said evil's evil and sorrow's sorrow
445,1963-142393-0020,by wrapping it up in other words other folks were not created for my sake that i should think all square when things turn out well for me but it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life
446,1963-142393-0021,which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible
447,1963-142393-0022,by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day the growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty
448,1963-142393-0023,we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or a philosopher to his less complete formula
449,1963-142393-0024,something like this sense of enlarged being was in adam's mind this sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past
450,1963-142393-0025,the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him tender and deep as his love for hetty had been
451,1963-142393-0026,so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away his love for dinah was better and more precious to him for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow
452,1963-142393-0027,it's like as if it was a new strength to me he said to himself to love her and know as she loves me
453,1963-142393-0028,for she's better than i am
454,1963-142393-0029,as if you could walk more fearless when you've more trust in another
455,1963-142393-0030,i've always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me
456,1963-142393-0031,when you can't look to them nearest to you t help you with a bit better thought
457,1963-142393-0032,when adam came in sight of the grey town on the hill side and looked searchingly towards the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill the scene looked less harsh in the soft
458,1963-142393-0033,october sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions
459,1963-142393-0034,that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky had a milder more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day adam's doubts and fears melted under this influence
460,1963-142393-0035,as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him he seemed to see dinah's gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know
461,1963-142393-0036,he did not expect dinah to be at home at this hour but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate
462,1963-142393-0037,he had set his mind on following her and bringing her home she was gone to sloman's end a hamlet about three miles off over the hill the old woman told him
463,1963-142393-0038,to preach in a cottage there as her habit was
464,1963-142393-0039,so adam got on his horse again and rode to the town putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord from whose friendly questions and reminiscences
465,1963-142393-0040,he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards sloman's end with all his haste it was nearly four o'clock before he could set off
466,1963-142393-0041,the little grey desolate looking hamlet unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn
467,1963-142393-0042,perhaps that's the last hymn before they come away adam thought i'll walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again
468,1963-142393-0043,and seated himself on a loose stone against the low wall to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill he chose this spot almost at the top of the hill
469,1963-142393-0044,because it was away from all eyes no house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep near no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky
470,1963-142393-0045,she was much longer coming than he expected he waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer at last he saw the little black figure
471,1963-142393-0046,coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill slowly adam thought but dinah was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step
472,1963-142393-0047,now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill but adam would not move yet he would not meet her too soon he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness and now he began to fear
473,1963-142393-0048,lest he should startle her too much yet he thought she's not one to be overstartled she's always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill
474,1963-142393-0049,perhaps she had found complete repose without him and had ceased to feel any need of his love on the verge of a decision we all tremble hope pauses with fluttering wings but now at last she was very near
475,1963-142393-0050,and adam rose from the stone wall it happened that just as he walked forward dinah had paused and turned round to look back at the village
476,1963-142393-0051,adam was glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him he came within three paces of her and then said dinah
477,1963-142393-0052,she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place dinah adam said again
478,1963-142393-0053,what was in her mind she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice but this second time she looked round
479,1963-142393-0054,what a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark eyed man she did not start again at the sight of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her round
480,1963-142393-0055,and they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell adam was content and said nothing it was dinah who spoke first adam she said it is the divine will
481,1963-142393-0056,my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you and this moment now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love i have a fulness of strength
482,1963-142393-0057,to bear and do our heavenly father's will that i had lost before adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes then we'll never part any more dinah till death parts us and they kissed each other
483,1963-147036-0000,the confession of odette rider he could only gaze in stupified silence you he said wonderingly the girl was pale and her eyes never left his face she nodded yes it is i she said in a low voice
484,1963-147036-0001,you he said again and walked towards her he held out his hand and she gave him the wallet without a word sit down he said kindly he thought she was going to faint i hope i didn't hurt you i hadn't the slightest idea
485,1963-147036-0002,she shook her head oh i'm not hurt she said wearily
486,1963-147036-0003,she drew a chair to the table and dropped her face upon her hands and he stood by embarrassed almost terrified by this unexpected development so you were the visitor on the bicycle he said at last i didn't suspect
487,1963-147036-0004,it struck him at that moment that it was not an offence for odette rider to go up to her mother's house on a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers if there was any crime at all
488,1963-147036-0005,she looked up at his words i on the bicycle she asked no it was not i not you she shook her head i was in the grounds
489,1963-147036-0006,i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet she said listlessly but i was not on the bicycle who was it he asked she shook her head may i have that please
490,1963-147036-0007,she held out her hand and he hesitated after all he had no right or title to this curious purse he compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it odette he said gently and walked round to her
491,1963-147036-0008,laying his hand on her shoulder why don't you tell me tell you what she asked without looking up tell me all there is to be told he said i could help you i want to help you she looked up at him
492,1963-147036-0009,he was tongue tied for a second because i love you he said and his voice shook it did not seem to him that he was talking the words came of their own volition he had no more intention of telling her he loved her indeed
493,1963-147036-0010,he had no more idea that he did love her than whiteside would have had yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips the effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him
494,1963-147036-0011,she did not shrink back she did not look surprised she showed no astonishment whatever
495,1963-147036-0012,oh that calm
496,1963-147036-0013,was the second shock of the evening it was as though she had known it all along he was on his knees by her side and his arm was about her shoulders even before his brain had willed the act my girl my girl he said gently won't you please tell me
497,1963-147036-0014,her head was still bent and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible tell you what she asked what you know of this business he said don't you realise how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion
498,1963-147036-0015,what business do you mean he hesitated the murder of thornton lyne i know nothing of that she made no response to that tender arm of his but sat rigid something in her attitude chilled him
499,1963-147036-0016,and he dropped her hand and rose when she looked up she saw that his face was white and set he walked to the door and unlocked it i'm not going to ask you any more he said quietly you know best why you came to me to night
500,1963-147036-0017,she got up to her feet unsteadily and swayed toward him in a second he was by her side his arms about her she made no resistance but rather he felt a yielding towards him which he had missed before her pale face was upturned to his and he stooped and kissed her
501,1963-147036-0018,odette odette he whispered don't you realise that i love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness won't you tell me everything please no no no she murmured with a little catch in her voice please don't ask me
502,1963-147036-0019,i am afraid oh i am afraid he crushed her in his arms his cheek against hers his lips tingling with the caress of her hair but there is nothing to be afraid of nothing he said eagerly if you were as guilty as hell i would save you
503,1963-147036-0020,if you are shielding somebody i would shield them because i love you odette no no she cried and pushed him back both her little hands pressing against his chest don't ask me don't ask me ask me tarling swung round
504,1963-147036-0021,there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him milburgh he said between his teeth milburgh smiled the other mockingly i am sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene
505,1963-147036-0022,but the occasion is a desperate one and i cannot afford to stand on ceremony mister tarling tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager one comprehensive glance the detective gave him
506,1963-147036-0023,noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood so you were the cyclist eh he said that's right said milburgh it is an exercise to which i am very partial what do you want asked tarling alert and watchful
507,1963-147036-0024,i want you to carry out your promise mister tarling said milburgh smoothly tarling stared at him my promise he said what promise to protect not only the evil doer
508,1963-147036-0025,tarling started do you mean to say he said hoarsely do you mean to accuse i accuse nobody said milburgh with a wide sweep of his hands i merely suggest that both miss rider and myself are in very serious trouble
509,1963-147036-0026,and that you have it in your power to get us safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow tarling took one step towards him and milburgh shrank back do you accuse miss rider of complicity in this murder he demanded milburgh smiled
510,1963-147036-0027,but it was an uneasy smile i make no accusation he said
511,1963-147036-0028,he shrugged his shoulders you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which i was endeavouring to remove to a place of safety tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it i shall see the contents of this wallet to morrow he said
512,1963-147036-0029,locks will present very little difficulty
513,1963-147036-0030,and pulled from his pocket a chain at the end of which dangled a small bunch of keys here is the key he said unlock and read to night tarling took the key in his hand inserted it in first one tiny lock and then in the other
514,1963-147036-0031,the catches snapped open and he threw back the flap then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girl's quivering face and read the terror in her eyes no no she cried almost beside herself no for god's sake no
515,1963-147036-0032,tarling stepped back he saw the malicious little smile on milburgh's face and could have struck him down miss rider does not wish me to see what is in this case he said
516,1963-147036-0033,here it was the girl's voice surprisingly clear and steady her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it toward the detective there is a reason she said in a low voice
517,1963-147036-0034,milburgh had gone too far tarling saw his face lengthen and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes then without further hesitation he opened the paper and read the first line took away his breath the confession of odette rider
518,1963-147036-0035,good god he muttered and read on
519,1926-147979-0000,winter lies too long in country towns hangs on until it is stale and shabby old and sullen on the farm the weather was the great fact and men's affairs went on underneath it as the streams creep under the ice
520,1926-147979-0001,but in black hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pinched frozen down to the bare stalk
521,1926-147979-0002,through january and february i went to the river with the harlings on clear nights and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on the frozen sand but by march the ice was rough and choppy
522,1926-147979-0003,at our comfortable hotel missus harling had known d'arnault for years
523,1926-147979-0004,the wind from without made waves in the long carpet a coal stove glowed at either end of the room and the grand piano in the middle stood open there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night
524,1926-147979-0005,for missus gardener had gone to omaha for a week johnnie had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent minded it was missus gardener who ran the business and looked after everything her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travelers
525,1926-147979-0006,he was a popular fellow but no manager missus gardener was admittedly the best dressed woman in black hawk drove the best horse and had a smart trap and a little white and gold sleigh
526,1926-147979-0007,she seemed indifferent to her possessions was not half so solicitous about them as her friends were she was tall dark severe with something indian like in the rigid immobility of her face her manner was cold and she talked little
527,1926-147979-0008,guests felt that they were receiving not conferring a favor when they stayed at her house even the smartest traveling men were flattered when missus gardener stopped to chat with them for a moment
528,1926-147979-0009,two classes those who had seen missus gardener's diamonds and those who had not when i stole into the parlor anson kirkpatrick marshall field's man
529,1926-147979-0010,he was a dapper little irishman very vain homely as a monkey with friends everywhere and a sweetheart in every port like a sailor i did not know all the men who were sitting about but i recognized a furniture salesman from kansas city
530,1926-147979-0011,a drug man and willy o'reilly who traveled for a jewelry house and sold musical instruments the talk was all about good and bad hotels actors and actresses and musical prodigies i learned that missus gardener had gone to omaha to hear booth and barrett
531,1926-147979-0012,who were to play there next week and that mary anderson was having a great success in a winter's tale in london the door from the office opened and johnnie gardener came in directing blind d'arnault he would never consent to be led
532,1926-147979-0013,his yellow face was lifted in the light with a show of white teeth all grinning and his shrunken papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes good evening gentlemen no ladies here good evening gentlemen
533,1926-147979-0014,we going to have a little music some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening it was the soft amiable negro voice like those i remembered from early childhood with the note of docile subservience in it
534,1926-147979-0015,he had the negro head too almost no head at all nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under close clipped wool
535,1926-147979-0016,when he was sitting or standing still he swayed back and forth incessantly like a rocking toy at the piano he swayed in time to the music and when he was not playing his body kept up this motion like an empty mill grinding on
536,1926-147979-0017,now gentlemen i expect you've all got grand voices seems like we might have some good old plantation songs to night the men gathered round him as he began to play my old kentucky home they sang one negro melody after another
537,1926-147979-0018,while the mulatto sat rocking himself his head thrown back his yellow face lifted its shriveled eyelids never fluttering he was born in the far south on the d'arnault plantation where the spirit if not the fact of slavery persisted
538,1926-147979-0019,when he was three weeks old he had an illness which left him totally blind
539,1926-147979-0020,his mother a buxom young negro wench who was laundress for the d'arnaults concluded that her blind baby was not right in his head and she was ashamed of him she loved him devotedly but he was so ugly with his sunken eyes and his fidgets
540,1926-147979-0021,that she hid him away from people all the dainties she brought down from the big house were for the blind child and she beat and cuffed her other children whenever she found them teasing him or trying to get his chicken bone away from him he began to talk early
541,1926-147979-0022,and his mammy said he was n't all wrong she named him samson because he was blind but on the plantation he was known as yellow martha's simple child
542,1926-147979-0023,he was docile and obedient but when he was six years old he began to run away from home always taking the same direction he felt his way through the lilacs along the boxwood hedge
543,1926-147979-0024,whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin she whipped him unmercifully and told him what dreadful things old mister d'arnault would do to him if he ever found him near the big house but the next time samson had a chance he ran away again
544,1926-147979-0025,and went toward the window she saw this hideous little pickaninny dressed in an old piece of sacking standing in the open space between the hollyhock rows his body rocking automatically his blind face lifted
545,1926-147979-0026,though it did not occur to her that he might have more of it than other children one day samson was standing thus while miss nellie was playing her lesson to her music master the windows were open
546,1926-147979-0027,talk a little while and then leave the room he heard the door close after them he crept up to the front windows and stuck his head in there was no one there he could always detect the presence of any one in a room
547,1926-147979-0028,he put one foot over the window sill and straddled it his mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mastiff if he ever found him meddling samson had got too near the mastiff's kennel once and had felt his terrible breath in his face
548,1926-147979-0029,he thought about that but he pulled in his other foot through the dark he found his way to the thing to its mouth he touched it softly and it answered softly kindly he shivered and stood still
549,1926-147979-0030,then he began to feel it all over ran his finger tips along the slippery sides embraced the carved legs tried to get some conception of its shape and size of the space it occupied in primeval night
550,1926-147979-0031,it was cold and hard and like nothing else in his black universe he went back to its mouth began at one end of the keyboard and felt his way down into the mellow thunder as far as he could go
551,1926-147979-0032,he seemed to know that it must be done with the fingers not with the fists or the feet he approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct and coupled himself to it as if he knew it was to piece him out and make a whole creature of him
552,1926-147979-0033,that lay under the bones of his pinched conical little skull definite as animal desires the door opened miss nellie and her music master stood behind it but blind samson who was so sensitive to presences did not know they were there
553,1926-147979-0034,he was feeling out the pattern that lay all ready made on the big and little keys when he paused for a moment because the sound was wrong and he wanted another miss nellie spoke softly he whirled about in a spasm of terror
554,1926-147979-0035,leaped forward in the dark struck his head on the open window and fell screaming and bleeding to the floor he had what his mother called a fit the doctor came and gave him opium when samson was well again his young mistress led him back to the piano
555,1926-147979-0036,several teachers experimented with him they found he had absolute pitch and a remarkable memory as a very young child he could repeat after a fashion any composition that was played for him no matter how many wrong notes he struck he never lost the intention of a passage
556,1926-147979-0037,as piano playing it was perhaps abominable but as music it was something real vitalized by a sense of rhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses that not only filled his dark mind but worried his body incessantly
557,1926-147979-0038,and he were gloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers in the middle of a crashing waltz d'arnault suddenly began to play softly and turning to one of the men who stood behind him whispered
558,1926-147979-0039,somebody dancing in there he jerked his bullet head toward the dining room i hear little feet girls i spect anson kirkpatrick mounted a chair and peeped over the transom
559,1926-147979-0040,springing down he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining room tiny and lena antonia and mary dusak were waltzing in the middle of the floor they separated and fled toward the kitchen giggling kirkpatrick caught tiny by the elbows
560,1926-147979-0041,what's the matter with you girls dancing out here by yourselves when there's a roomful of lonesome men on the other side of the partition introduce me to your friends tiny the girls still laughing were trying to escape tiny looked alarmed
561,1926-147979-0042,she protested she'd be awful mad if you was to come out here and dance with us missus gardener's in omaha girl
562,1926-147979-0043,and you're tony and you're mary have i got you all straight o'reilly and the others began to pile the chairs on the tables johnnie gardener ran in from the office easy boys easy he entreated them you'll wake the cook and there'll be the devil to pay for me
563,1926-147979-0044,s a fact boys he said confidentially
564,1926-147979-0045,oh we'll make it all right with molly get your back up johnnie molly was missus gardener's name of course
565,1926-147979-0046,and on his watch case doubtless on his heart too he was an affectionate little man and he thought his wife a wonderful woman he knew that without her he would hardly be more than a clerk in some other man's hotel at a word from kirkpatrick
566,1926-147979-0047,over the piano and began to draw the dance music out of it while the perspiration shone on his short wool and on his uplifted face
567,1926-147979-0048,whenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath he would boom out softly who's that goin back on me one of these city gentlemen i bet now you girls
568,1926-147979-0049,antonia seemed frightened at first
569,1926-147979-0050,tiny soderball was trim and slender with lively little feet and pretty ankles she wore her dresses very short she was quicker in speech lighter in movement and manner than the other girls mary dusak was broad and
570,1926-147979-0051,she looked bold and resourceful and unscrupulous and she was all of these they were handsome girls had the fresh color of their country up bringing and in their eyes that brilliancy which is called by no metaphor alas
571,1926-147979-0052,the light of youth d'arnault played until his manager came and shut the piano before he left us he showed us his gold watch which struck the hours and a topaz ring given him by some russian nobleman who delighted in negro melodies
572,1926-147979-0053,and had heard d'arnault play in new orleans at last he tapped his way upstairs after bowing to everybody docile and happy i walked home with antonia we were so excited that we dreaded to go to bed
573,1926-143879-0000,chapter thirty one isabel came back to florence but only after several months an interval sufficiently replete with incident it is not however during this interval that we are closely concerned with her
574,1926-143879-0001,our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late spring time shortly after her return to palazzo crescentini
575,1926-143879-0002,to social uses and there was that in her expression and attitude
576,1926-143879-0003,the tall window was open and though its green shutters were partly drawn the bright air of the garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with warmth
577,1926-143879-0004,too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle
578,1926-143879-0005,since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always reigned she wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do
579,1926-143879-0006,grave she found herself and positively more weighted as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world
580,1926-143879-0007,a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at gardencourt a couple of years before
581,1926-143879-0008,if her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present
582,1926-143879-0009,with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted
583,1926-143879-0010,she had left her husband behind her but had brought her children to whom isabel now played with equal munificence and tenderness the part of maiden aunt mister ludlow
584,1926-143879-0011,the little ludlows had not yet even from the american point of view
585,1926-143879-0012,lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows
586,1926-143879-0013,and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped
587,1926-143879-0014,and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made
588,1926-143879-0015,missus ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations
589,1926-143879-0016,missus ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently various
590,1926-143879-0017,which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another
591,1926-143879-0018,on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities
592,1926-143879-0019,isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lily's understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides
593,1926-143879-0020,the trophies lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this was exactly what she had expected of isabel to give it form and body
594,1926-143879-0021,we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land
595,1926-143879-0022,than that she didn't wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lily's advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever
596,1926-143879-0023,but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabel's silence about mister osmond for instance
597,1926-143879-0024,was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to missus ludlow that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune
598,1926-143879-0025,it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews
599,1926-143879-0026,the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in the street lamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red
600,1926-143879-0027,and euston square was a long way from piccadilly but isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily
601,1926-143879-0028,set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets the moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark
602,1926-143879-0029,she made her way down to rome without touching at florence
603,1926-143879-0030,in the september previous had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer
604,1926-143879-0031,and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mister bantling that he would soon come over
605,1926-143879-0032,had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame merle that they should make a little pilgrimage to the east madame merle remarked that her friend was restless
606,1926-143879-0033,but she added that she herself had always been consumed with the desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt
607,1926-143879-0034,isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites
608,1926-143879-0035,her character had revealed itself
609,1926-143879-0036,a consummation the more desirable
610,1926-143879-0037,she considered with the presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it
611,1926-143879-0038,an occasional lapse from candour in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception
612,1926-143879-0039,and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain
613,1926-143879-0040,advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend
614,1926-143879-0041,but it stood for a high water mark in the ebb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less
615,1926-143879-0042,a stationary affection in other words was impossible it must move one way or the other however that might be the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been
616,1926-143879-0043,i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo or as she stood among the broken columns of the acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamis
617,1926-143879-0044,deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival
618,1926-143879-0045,during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone to lodge made it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came
619,1926-143879-0046,and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini madame merle on this occasion remaining in rome
620,1926-147987-0000,the day after the cutters left antonia came over to see us grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted you've got something on your mind antonia she said anxiously
621,1926-147987-0001,she hesitated and then told us how strangely mister cutter had behaved before he went away
622,1926-147987-0002,as he had just put a new yale lock on the front door cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone
623,1926-147987-0003,or the way he looked at her i feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again
624,1926-147987-0004,grandmother was apprehensive at once i don't think it's right for you to stay there feeling that way i suppose it would n't be right for you to leave the place alone either
625,1926-147987-0005,maybe jim would be willing to go over there and sleep and you could come here nights i'd feel safer knowing you were under my own roof i guess jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could
626,1926-147987-0006,antonia turned to me eagerly oh would you jim
627,1926-147987-0007,the third night i spent at the cutters i awoke suddenly with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut everything was still however and i must have gone to sleep again immediately
628,1926-147987-0008,i was only half awake but i decided that he might take the cutters silver whoever he was
629,1926-147987-0009,i held my breath and lay absolutely still a hand closed softly on my shoulder and at the same moment i felt something hairy and cologne scented brushing my face
630,1926-147987-0010,the man became insane he stood over me choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse so this is what she's up to when i'm away is it where is she you nasty whelp
631,1926-147987-0011,where is she under the bed are you hussy i know your tricks wait till i get at you i'll fix this rat you've got in here he's caught all right so long as cutter had me by the throat there was no chance for me at all
632,1926-147987-0012,when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to do anything about it i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hatrack lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep
633,1926-147987-0013,her cry of fright awakened me truly i was a battered object as she helped me to my room i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my lip was cut and stood out like a snout my nose looked like a big blue plum
634,1926-147987-0014,and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have the doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her
635,1926-147987-0015,she seemed to understand though i was too faint and miserable to go into explanations when she took
636,1926-147987-0016,she spent the whole morning bathing and poulticing me and rubbing me with arnica i heard antonia sobbing outside my door but i asked grandmother to send her away i felt that i never wanted to see her again
637,1926-147987-0017,she had let me in for all this disgustingness grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antonia but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude
638,1926-147987-0018,if the story once got abroad i would never hear the last of it i could well imagine what the old men down at the drug store would do with such a theme
639,1926-147987-0019,and had left again on the six o'clock train for denver that morning the agent said his face was striped with court plaster and he carried his left hand in a sling he looked so used up that the agent asked him what had happened to him since ten o'clock the night before
640,1926-147987-0020,my own garments had been treated so badly that i never saw them again grandmother burned them in the cutters kitchen range while antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it the front door bell rang violently
641,1926-147987-0021,there stood missus cutter locked out for she had no key to the new lock her head trembling with rage i advised her to control herself or she would have a stroke grandmother said afterwards
642,1926-147987-0022,antonia was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told missus cutter it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then missus cutter told her story
643,1926-147987-0023,she and her husband had started home from omaha together the morning before they had to stop over several hours at waymore junction to catch the black hawk train
644,1926-147987-0024,when he returned he told her that he would have to stay overnight there
645,1926-147987-0025,she saw him slip a twenty dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket that bill she said should have aroused her suspicions at once but did not the trains are never called at little junction towns everybody knows when they come in
646,1926-147987-0026,mister cutter showed his wife's ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off
647,1926-147987-0027,and that cutter must have planned it so the conductor told her the black hawk train was due at waymore twelve minutes after the kansas city train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to black hawk without her
648,1926-147987-0028,she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omaha hotel
649,1926-147987-0029,but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible mister cutter will pay for this missus burden he will pay missus cutter avouched nodding her horselike head and rolling her eyes
650,1926-147987-0030,certainly cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil in some way he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her hysterical nature perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife's rage and amazement
651,1926-147987-0031,than from any experiences of his own his zest in debauchery might wane but never missus cutter's belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on
652,7780-274562-0000,the azure fields of heaven were sembled right in a large round set with flow'rs of light the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew that hung upon their azure leaves did show like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev'ning blue
653,7780-274562-0001,giles fletcher no more remarkable man ever lived than my friend the young ellison he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune
654,7780-274562-0002,from his cradle to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness
655,7780-274562-0003,the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of turgot price priestley and condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance
656,7780-274562-0004,what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma that in man's physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle
657,7780-274562-0005,the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of his career has taught me to understand that in general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind
658,7780-274562-0006,that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content and that even now in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the social condition
659,7780-274562-0007,it is not impossible that man the individual under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued
660,7780-274562-0008,and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert it is indeed evident
661,7780-274562-0009,experience mister ellison would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments
662,7780-274562-0010,but it is by no means my present object to pen an essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words he admitted but four unvarying laws
663,7780-274562-0011,or rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air the health he said
664,7780-274562-0012,attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name he pointed to the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class are proverbially more happy than others
665,7780-274562-0013,and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox hunter his second principle was the love of woman
666,7780-274562-0014,his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he held that other things being equal the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object
667,7780-274562-0015,i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men
668,7780-274562-0016,his intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women
669,7780-274562-0017,his possessions had been always ample but upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur
670,7780-274562-0018,and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it appears that about one hundred years prior to mister ellison's attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province
671,7780-274562-0019,ellison this gentlemen had amassed a princely fortune and having no very immediate connexions conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease
672,7780-274562-0020,minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the end of the hundred years
673,7780-274562-0021,many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character rendered them abortive
674,7780-274562-0022,a decree finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison upon his twenty first birth day
675,7780-274562-0023,from entering into possession as the heir of his ancestor seabright of a fortune of
676,7780-274562-0024,there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic
677,7780-274562-0025,the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen
678,7780-274562-0026,it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or busying himself with political intrigues or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility
679,7780-274562-0027,or devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large specimens of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters and art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity
680,7780-274562-0028,but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to figures
681,7780-274562-0029,and figures but sufficed to confound it was seen that even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars
682,7780-274562-0030,which was one million and one hundred and twenty five thousand per month or thirty six thousand nine hundred and eighty six per day or one thousand five hundred and forty one per hour or
683,7780-274562-0031,six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to imagine
684,7780-274562-0032,enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance i was not surprised however
685,7780-274562-0033,nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet he comprehended moreover the true character the august aims
686,7780-274562-0034,the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some peculiarities either in his early education
687,7780-274562-0035,or in the nature of his intellect
688,7780-274562-0036,and it was this bias perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment
689,7780-274562-0037,was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in its every day acceptation
690,7780-274562-0038,or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his which i have already mentioned the idea that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth
691,7780-274562-0039,is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition
692,7780-274562-0040,and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen and that
693,7780-274562-0041,unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion the world will never behold that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer productions of art
694,7780-274562-0042,of which the human nature is absolutely capable mister ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse
695,7780-274562-0043,under other circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become a painter the field of sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical
696,7780-274562-0044,was too limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied at any time much of his attention and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which
697,7780-274562-0045,even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating i mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment
698,7780-274562-0046,no definition had spoken of the landscape gardener as of the poet yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the landscape garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities
699,7780-274562-0047,here was indeed the fairest field for the display of invention or imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty
700,7780-274562-0048,the elements which should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in the multiform of the tree
701,7780-274562-0049,and in the multicolor of the flower he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness and in the direction or concentration of this effort or
702,7780-274562-0050,he perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the greatest advantage in the fulfilment of his destiny as poet
703,7780-274562-0051,its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth in his explanation of this phraseology mister ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma i mean the fact
704,7780-274562-0052,which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce
705,7780-274562-0053,while the component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short no position can be attained
706,7780-274562-0054,from which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is this
707,7780-274562-0055,in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley
708,7780-274562-0056,the criticism which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points
709,7780-274562-0057,of human loveliness do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path byron who often erred erred not in saying i've seen more living beauty
710,7780-274562-0058,ripe and real than all the nonsense of their stone ideal in landscape alone is the principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here
711,7780-274562-0059,it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art having i say felt its truth here
712,7780-274562-0060,for the feeling is no affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist he not only believes
713,7780-274562-0061,but positively knows that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form constitute and alone constitute the true beauty
714,7780-274562-0062,yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them
715,7780-274562-0063,in his instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his compeers let a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form
716,7780-274562-0064,let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity be admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective composition
717,7780-274562-0065,each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that
718,7780-274562-0066,therefore her susceptibility of improvement
719,7780-274562-0067,it was mister ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty
720,7780-274562-0068,that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens
721,7780-274562-0069,it is easily understood says mister ellison that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a general and more distantly observed effect
722,7780-274562-0070,he spoke upon this topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance which is little
723,7780-274562-0071,or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class of beings human once but now to humanity invisible
724,7780-274562-0072,for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful more especially than for our own had been set in order by god the great landscape garden of the whole earth in the course of our discussion
725,7780-274562-0073,to have well treated this theme there are properly he writes but two styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial
726,7780-274562-0074,one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land
727,7780-274562-0075,detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of the natural style of gardening
728,7780-274562-0076,in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify
729,7780-274562-0077,it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english style
730,7780-274562-0078,which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening
731,7780-274562-0079,a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral a terrace
732,7780-274562-0080,calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest
733,7780-274562-0081,from what i have already observed said mister ellison you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country
734,7780-274562-0082,the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities
735,7780-274562-0083,what is said in respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of speech which may mean much or little or nothing
736,7780-274562-0084,that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles
737,7780-274562-0085,is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius the merit suggested is at best negative
738,7780-274562-0086,and appertains to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate addison into apotheosis in truth
739,7780-274562-0087,appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier merit which breathes and flames in invention or creation can be apprehended solely in its results
740,7780-274562-0088,rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance to the virtues which deny or refrain beyond these the critical art can but suggest
741,7780-274562-0089,we may be instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a tempest an inferno a prometheus bound a nightingale
742,7780-274562-0090,such as that of keats or the sensitive plant of shelley but the thing done
743,7780-274562-0091,the sophists of the negative school who through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what
744,7780-274562-0092,in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime
745,7780-274562-0093,are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so
746,7780-274562-0094,i repeat that the principle here expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested
747,7780-274562-0095,yet which if attained would lend a charm to the landscape garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow
748,7780-274562-0096,so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in bringing about such result
749,7780-274562-0097,he secures all the advantages of interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art
750,7780-274562-0098,in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling
751,7780-274562-0099,now if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness
752,7780-274562-0100,definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity
753,7780-274562-0101,then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god nor an emanation of god
754,7780-274562-0102,in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this
755,7780-274562-0103,in the free exercise in the open air which resulted from personal direction of his plans in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford
756,7780-274562-0104,in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect and lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife
757,7780-274562-0105,that ellison thought to find and found an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity
758,2518-154825-0000,how fearful and dizzy tis to cast one's eyes so low i'll look no more
759,2518-154825-0001,shakespeare the while chalk was a bulwark between us and the foe and though one or two of them loosed off their matchlocks trying to get at us sideways they could not even see their quarry
760,2518-154825-0002,and twas only shooting at a venture we were safe but for how short a time safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us
761,2518-154825-0003,safe with a discharged pistol in our grasp and a shot man lying at our feet elzevir was the first to speak can you stand john is the bone broken
762,2518-154825-0004,i cannot stand i said there is something gone in my leg and i feel blood running down into my boot he knelt and rolled down the leg of my stocking but though he only moved my foot
763,2518-154825-0005,ever so little it caused me sharp pain for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot they have broke the leg though it bleeds little elzevir said we have no time to splice it here
764,2518-154825-0006,but i will put a kerchief round and while i wrap it listen to how we lie and then choose what we shall do i nodded biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me and he went on
765,2518-154825-0007,we have a quarter of an hour before the posse can get down to us but come they will and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty
766,2518-154825-0008,and he jerked his thumb at maskew
767,2518-154825-0009,and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a charge in air so one thing we can do is to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg
768,2518-154825-0010,and they will take thee alive and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end
769,2518-154825-0011,so only gave a sigh wishing heartily that maskew were not dead and that my leg were not broke but that i was back again at the why not or even hearing one of doctor sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlour
770,2518-154825-0012,there is yet another way that we may try and if thou hadst but two whole legs i would have tried it but now tis little short of madness and yet if thou fear'st not i will still try it
771,2518-154825-0013,just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle path leads down but not a hundred yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts
772,2518-154825-0014,where the under cliff dies back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it and of men
773,2518-154825-0015,i never heard but one had climbed it and that was lander jordan when the excise was on his heels half a century back but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight
774,2518-154825-0016,yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry thee some way and where there is no room to carry
775,2518-154825-0017,it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall
776,2518-154825-0018,tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg
777,2518-154825-0019,and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the under cliff
778,2518-154825-0020,and twas a task that might cow the bravest and when i looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below
779,2518-154825-0021,for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face
780,2518-154825-0022,faugh said elzevir tis a poor beast has lost his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag
781,2518-154825-0023,and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and tis too late now to change counsel
782,2518-154825-0024,we have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hour's start or more for they will take all that to search the under cliff and maskew too
783,2518-154825-0025,will keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning
784,2518-154825-0026,so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
785,2518-154825-0027,in a minute i knew from elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path even free and untrammelled
786,2518-154825-0028,and not a man in all the world to do it with a full grown lad in his arms yet elzevir made no bones of it nor spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot
787,2518-154825-0029,thus he went on for a time that seemed without end and yet was really but a minute or two and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive at all on the under cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliff side
788,2518-154825-0030,and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop
789,2518-154825-0031,but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again
790,2518-154825-0032,the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff
791,2518-154825-0033,for there is no room to dance hornpipes here and hold thy eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither down nor seaward twas well he told me what to do and well i did it
792,2518-154825-0034,but spent much time that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he
793,2518-154825-0035,forgetting what i suffered cried out quicken thy pace lad if thou canst the time is short now so frail is man's temper that though he was doing more than any ever did to save another's life and was all i had to trust to in the world yet
794,2518-154825-0036,but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
795,2518-154825-0037,and then while he knelt down upon the path
796,2518-154825-0038,putting my arms round his neck and so he bore me pickaback i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
797,2518-154825-0039,both were on all fours now elzevir first and i following but as i crept along i relaxed care for a moment and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down and far below
798,2518-154825-0040,i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
799,2518-154825-0041,felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff
800,2518-154825-0042,and how he did it in such a narrow strait i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight
801,2518-154825-0043,i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint
802,2518-154825-0044,so i gave out one two three and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself though his words seemed thin and far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here
803,2518-154825-0045,and in five more they will be on the under cliff and if we ever reach the top who knows but they have left a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag and if they knew
804,2518-154825-0046,like sitting guillemots against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
805,2518-154825-0047,thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton
806,2518-154825-0048,i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes
807,2518-154825-0049,i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gulls seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said
808,2518-154825-0050,there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are lost pluck up thy courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot
809,2518-154825-0051,move thou must and tis better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him
810,2518-154825-0052,now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path
811,2518-154825-0053,so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskew's body
812,2518-154825-0054,it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright of falling left me in a moment
813,2518-154825-0055,and i could open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands and knees and elzevir
814,2518-154825-0056,thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us
815,2518-154826-0000,the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver grey film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
816,2518-154826-0001,with the straight sunpath across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerel's back the relief of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken
817,2518-154826-0002,and the wind which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seemed now but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew apace
818,2518-154826-0003,and i fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second
819,2518-154826-0004,there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all
820,2518-154826-0005,there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of sleep
821,2518-154826-0006,and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
822,2518-154826-0007,this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbeck which they call joseph's pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there
823,2518-154826-0008,and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish
824,2518-154826-0009,that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
825,2518-154826-0010,it was after noon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
826,2518-154826-0011,the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
827,2518-154826-0012,behind one of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush elzevir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry thee no farther for this present
828,2518-154826-0013,though there is not now much farther to go we have passed purbeck gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon
829,2518-154826-0014,and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the sun's heat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now tis different
830,2518-154826-0015,so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up
831,2518-154826-0016,i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound' and he took maskew's silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly
832,2518-154826-0017,with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west
833,2518-154826-0018,and now that i was under the lee of the wall
834,2518-154826-0019,and gets at length into shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzevir i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to lull me to slumber
835,2518-154826-0020,then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
836,2518-154826-0021,that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones then i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty
837,2518-154826-0022,but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
838,2518-154826-0023,and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
839,2518-154826-0024,enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall
840,2518-154826-0025,we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall and so elzevir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off
841,2518-154826-0026,but elzevir passed him the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer topp was the answer
842,2518-154826-0027,have you got a charge of powder to spare said elzevir showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe you've seen a flask in walking through the furrows he whispered to me to lie still
843,2518-154826-0028,no time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy
844,2518-154826-0029,and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
845,2518-154826-0030,but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more says elzevir the tempter
846,2518-154826-0031,the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion
847,2518-154826-0032,for while he spoke i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied round my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the firelock
848,2518-154826-0033,these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hill side come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
849,2518-154826-0034,and so i said as much to elzevir who only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough
850,2518-154826-0035,but when elzevir sat down the boy gave a careful look round and seeing no one watching any more
851,2518-154826-0036,then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hill brow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is past already
852,2518-154826-0037,we must have slept three hours or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john tis when the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posse might have had us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with a lusty stride
853,2518-154826-0038,and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again
854,2518-154826-0039,elzevir was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point
855,2518-154826-0040,although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbeck marble which you see in old churches in our country
856,2518-154826-0041,and i am told in other parts of england as well and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned askew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then
857,2518-154826-0042,from the bottom of this shaft there spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly six feet high but sometimes only three or four and in these the marble is dug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves
858,2518-154826-0043,which was just putting on the brighter green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment had covered for the most part
859,2518-154826-0044,though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peering out at the top of a mound there were many tumble down walls and low gables left of the cottages of the old quarrymen grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds
860,2518-154826-0045,and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush
861,2518-154826-0046,on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of the shafts
862,2518-154826-0047,for if it were not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low
863,2518-154826-0048,and the sward crept over the edges of the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps
864,2518-154826-0049,there he said this is joseph's pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry
865,2518-154826-0050,and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as one goes down a hatchway
866,2518-154826-0051,and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
867,2518-154826-0052,he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand
868,2518-154826-0053,and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down
869,2518-154826-0054,and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and lit a match
870,4830-25904-0000,being alone in london yet wishing to celebrate the day i decided to pay my respects to the lions at the zoological gardens a lovely place it was and i enjoyed myself immensely for may day in england is just what it should be
871,4830-25904-0001,mild sunny flowery and spring like as i walked along the well kept paths between white and rosy hawthorn hedges i kept coming upon new and curious sights
872,4830-25904-0002,for the birds and beasts are so skilfully arranged that it is more like travelling through a strange and pleasant country than visiting a menagerie the first thing i saw was a great american bison
873,4830-25904-0003,and i was so glad to meet with any one from home that i'd have patted him with pleasure if he had shown any cordiality toward me he didn't however
874,4830-25904-0004,and put down his immense head with a sullen snort as if he'd have tossed me with great satisfaction i did not blame him for the poor fellow was homesick doubtless for his own wide prairies and the free life he had lost
875,4830-25904-0005,so i threw him some fresh clover and went on to the pelicans i never knew before what handsome birds they were not graceful but with such snowy plumage tinged with pale pink and faint yellow
876,4830-25904-0006,they had just had their bath and stood arranging their feathers with their great bills
877,4830-25904-0007,when fed they gobbled up the fish never stopping to swallow it till the pouches under their bills were full then they leisurely emptied them and seemed to enjoy their lunch with the grave deliberation of regular englishmen
878,4830-25904-0008,and there found a splendid sight six lions and lionesses in three or four different cages sitting or standing in dignified attitudes and eyeing the spectators with a mild expression in their fine eyes
879,4830-25904-0009,one lioness was ill and lay on her bed looking very pensive while her mate moved restlessly about her evidently anxious to do something for her and much afflicted by her suffering
880,4830-25904-0010,i liked this lion very much for though the biggest he was very gentle and had a noble face the tigers were rushing about as tigers usually are some creeping noiselessly to and fro
881,4830-25904-0011,some leaping up and down and some washing their faces with their velvet paws all looked and acted so like cats that i wasn't at all surprised to hear one of them purr when the keeper scratched her head
882,4830-25904-0012,it was a very loud and large purr but no fireside pussy could have done it better and every one laughed at the sound there were pretty spotted leopards panthers and smaller varieties of the same species
883,4830-25904-0013,i sat watching them a long time longing to let some of the wild things out for a good run they seemed so unhappy barred in those small dens suddenly the lions began to roar the tigers to snarl
884,4830-25904-0014,and all to get very much excited about something sniffing at the openings thrusting their paws through the bars and lashing their tails impatiently i couldn't imagine what the trouble was till
885,4830-25904-0015,this was their dinner and as they were fed but once a day they were ravenous such roars and howls and cries as arose while the man went slowly down the line
886,4830-25904-0016,gave one a good idea of the sounds to be heard in indian forests and jungles the lions behaved best for they only paced up and down with an occasional cry but the tigers were quite frantic
887,4830-25904-0017,for they tumbled one over the other shook the cages and tried to reach the bystanders
888,4830-25904-0018,one lady had a fright for the wind blew the end of her shawl within reach of a tiger's great claw and he clutched it trying to drag her nearer the shawl came off and the poor lady ran away screaming
889,4830-25904-0019,as if a whole family of wild beasts were after her
890,4830-25904-0020,the tigers snarled and fought and tore and got so savage i was very grateful that they were safely shut up in a few minutes nothing but white bones remained and then they howled for more
891,4830-25904-0021,one little leopard was better bred than the others for he went up on a shelf in the cage and ate his dinner in a quiet proper manner which was an example to the rest the lions ate in dignified silence
892,4830-25904-0022,all but my favourite who carried his share to his sick mate and by every gentle means in his power tried to make her eat she was too ill however and turned away with a plaintive moan which seemed to grieve him sadly
893,4830-25904-0023,he wouldn't touch his dinner but lay down near her with the lump between his paws as if guarding it for her and there i left him patiently waiting in spite of his hunger till his mate could share it with him
894,4830-25904-0024,as i took a last look at his fine old face i named him douglas and walked away humming to myself the lines of the ballad douglas douglas tender and true
895,4830-25904-0025,as a contrast to the wild beasts i went to see the monkeys who lived in a fine large house all to themselves here was every variety from the great ugly chimpanzee to the funny little fellows
896,4830-25904-0026,who played like boys and cut up all sorts of capers a mamma sat tending her baby and looking so like a little old woman that i laughed till the gray monkey with the blue nose scolded at me
897,4830-25904-0027,he was a cross old party and sat huddled up in the straw scowling at every one like an ill tempered old bachelor half a dozen little ones teased him capitally by dropping bits of bread
898,4830-25904-0028,nut shells and straws down on him from above as they climbed about the perches or swung by their tails one poor little chap had lost the curly end of his tail i'm afraid the gray one bit it off
899,4830-25904-0029,and kept trying to swing like the others forgetting that the strong curly end was what he held on with he would run up the bare boughs and give a jump expecting to catch and swing but the lame tail wouldn't hold him and down he'd go
900,4830-25904-0030,bounce on to the straw at first he'd sit and stare about him as if much amazed to find himself there then he'd scratch his little round head and begin to scold violently which seemed to delight the other monkeys
901,4830-25904-0031,and finally he'd examine his poor little tail and appear to understand the misfortune which had befallen him the funny expression of his face was irresistible and i enjoyed seeing him very much
902,4830-25904-0032,and gave him a bun to comfort him when i went away the snake house came next and i went in on my way to visit the rhinoceros family i rather like snakes
903,4830-25904-0033,since i had a tame green one who lived under the door step and would come out and play with me on sunny days these snakes i found very interesting only they got under their blankets and wouldn't come out and i wasn't allowed to poke them
904,4830-25904-0034,and blinked at me through the glass looking quite as dangerous as he was there were big and little snakes black brown and speckled lively and lazy pretty and plain ones but i liked the great boa
905,4830-25904-0035,best when i came to his cage i didn't see anything but the branch of a tree such as i had seen in other cages for the snakes to wind up and down where is he i wonder i hope he hasn't got
906,4830-25904-0036,out i said to myself thinking of a story i read once of a person in a menagerie who turned suddenly and saw a great boa gliding towards him
907,4830-25904-0037,as i stood wondering if the big worm could be under the little flat blanket before me the branch began to move all at once and with a start i saw a limb swing down to stare at me with the boa's glittering eyes
908,4830-25904-0038,and lay so still i had not seen him till he came to take a look at me a very villainous looking reptile he was and i felt grateful that i didn't live in a country
909,4830-25904-0039,where such unpleasant neighbours might pop in upon you unexpectedly he was kind enough to take a promenade and show me his size which seemed immense as he stretched himself
910,4830-25904-0040,and then knotted his rough grayish body into a great loop with the fiery eyed head in the middle he was not one of the largest kind but i was quite satisfied and left him to his dinner of rabbits
911,4830-25904-0041,which i hadn't the heart to stay and see him devour alive i was walking toward the camel's pagoda when all of a sudden a long dark curling thing came over my shoulder and i felt warm breath in my face it's the boa i thought
912,4830-25904-0042,much to the amusement of some children riding on the elephant whose trunk had frightened me he had politely tried to tell me to clear the way which i certainly had done with all speed picking myself out of the hedge
913,4830-25904-0043,i walked beside him examining his clumsy feet and peering up at his small intelligent eye i'm very sure he winked at me as if enjoying the joke and kept poking his trunk into my pocket
914,4830-25904-0044,hoping to find something eatable i felt as if i had got into a foreign country as i looked about me and saw elephants and camels walking among the trees flocks of snow white cranes stalking over the grass
915,4830-25904-0045,on their long scarlet legs striped zebras racing in their paddock queer kangaroos hopping about with little ones in their pouches pretty antelopes chasing one another
916,4830-25904-0046,and in an immense wire covered aviary all sorts of brilliant birds were flying about as gaily as if at home one of the curiosities was a sea cow who lived in a tank of salt water
917,4830-25904-0047,and came at the keeper's call to kiss him and flounder on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish it was very like a seal only much larger and had four fins instead of two
918,4830-25904-0048,its eyes were lovely so dark and soft and liquid but its mouth was not pretty and i declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command
919,4830-25904-0049,the great polar bear lived next door and spent his time splashing in and out of a pool of water or sitting on a block of ice panting as if the mild spring day was blazing midsummer
920,4830-25904-0050,he looked very unhappy and i thought it a pity that they didn't invent a big refrigerator for him these are not half of the wonderful creatures i saw
921,4830-25898-0000,there never was a prouder mamma than madam cluck when she led forth her family of eight downy little chicks chanticleer strut snowball speckle peep peck downy and blot were their names
922,4830-25898-0001,and no sooner were they out of the shell than they began to chirp and scratch as gaily as if the big world in which they suddenly found themselves was made for their especial benefit it was a fine brood
923,4830-25898-0002,but poor madam cluck had bad luck with her chicks for they were her first and she didn't know how to manage them old aunt cockletop told her that she didn't and predicted that those poor dears would come to bad ends
924,4830-25898-0003,aunt cockletop was right as you will see when i have told the sad history of this unfortunate family the tragedy began with chanty who was the boldest little cockadoodle who ever tried to crow
925,4830-25898-0004,before he had a feather to his bit of a tail chanty began to fight and soon was known as the most quarrelsome chick in the farm yard having pecked his brothers and sisters he tried to do the same to his playmates
926,4830-25898-0005,the ducklings goslings and young turkeys and was so disagreeable that all the fowls hated him one day a pair of bantams arrived pretty little white birds with red crests and nice yellow feet
927,4830-25898-0006,chanty thought he could beat mister bantam easily he was so small and invited him to fight mister b declined then chanty called him a coward and gave missus b a peck
928,4830-25898-0007,which ended in chanty's utter defeat for he died from his wounds downy and snowball soon followed for the two sweet little things would swing on the burdock leaves that grew over the brook
929,4830-25898-0008,sitting side by side the plump sisters were placidly swaying up and down over the clear brown water rippling below when ah sad to relate the stem broke and down went leaf
930,4830-25898-0009,chickens and all to a watery death i'm the most unlucky hen ever hatched groaned
931,4830-25898-0010,and it did seem so for the very next week speckle the best and prettiest of the brood went to walk with aunt cockletop grasshoppering they called it in the great field across the road
932,4830-25898-0011,what a nice time speckle did have to be sure for the grasshoppers were lively and fat and aunt was in an unusually amiable mood never run away from anything but face danger and conquer it
933,4830-25898-0012,like a brave chick said the old biddy as she went clucking through the grass with her gray turban wagging in the wind speckle had hopped away from a toad with a startled chirp which caused aunt to utter that remark
934,4830-25898-0013,the words had hardly left her beak when a shadow above made her look up give one loud croak of alarm and then scuttle away as fast as legs and wings could carry her little speckle remembering the advice
935,4830-25898-0014,and unconscious of the danger stood her ground as a great hawk came circling nearer and nearer till with a sudden dart he pounced on the poor chicken and bore it away chirping dismally
936,4830-25898-0015,what shall i do it was a dreadful blow to missus cluck and aunt cockletop didn't show herself for a whole day after that story was known
937,4830-25898-0016,for every fowl in the yard twitted her with the difference between her preaching and her practice
938,4830-25898-0017,he was at it from morning till night and everyone was tired to death of hearing his shrill small voice making funny attempts to produce hoarse little crows as he sat on the wall and stretched his yellow neck
939,4830-25898-0018,till his throat quite ached with the effort ah if i could only fly to the highest beam in the barn and give a splendid crow that everyone could hear i should be perfectly happy said this silly little fowl
940,4830-25898-0019,so he tried every day to fly and crow and at last managed to get up then how he did strut and rustle his feathers while his playmates sat below and watched him
941,4830-25898-0020,you'll fall and get hurt said his sister blot hold your tongue you ugly little thing and don't talk to me i'm going to crow and can't be interrupted by any silly bit of a hen be quiet down there
942,4830-25898-0021,and hear if i can't do it as well as daddy the chicks stopped scratching and peeping and sat in a row to hear strut crow perching himself on the beam he tried his best
943,4830-25898-0022,came of it and all the chicks laughed that made strut mad and he resolved to crow even if he killed himself doing it he gave an angry cluck flapped his wings and tried again alas alas
944,4830-25898-0023,for poor strut he leaned so far forward in his frantic effort to get a big crow out that he toppled over and fell bump on the hard barn floor killing himself instantly
945,4830-25898-0024,for some time after this missus cluck kept her three remaining little ones close to her side watching over them with maternal care till they were heartily tired of her anxious cluckings peep and peck were always together
946,4830-25898-0025,being very fond of one another peep was a most inquisitive chicken poking her head into every nook and corner and never satisfied till she had seen all there was to see peck was a glutton
947,4830-25898-0026,eating everything she could find and often making herself ill by gobbling too fast and forgetting to eat a little gravel to help digest her food don't go out of the barn children i'm going to lay an egg
948,4830-25898-0027,and can't look after you just now said their mother one day yes ma'am chirped the chickens and then as she went rustling into the hay mow they began to run about and enjoy themselves with all their might
949,4830-25898-0028,peep found a little hole into the meal room and slipped in full of joy at the sight of the bags boxes and bins i'll eat all i want and then i'll call peck she said
950,4830-25898-0029,and having taken a taste of every thing she was about to leave when she heard the stableman coming and in her fright couldn't find the hole so flew into the meal bin and hid herself
951,4830-25898-0030,sam never saw her but shut down the cover of the bin as he passed and left poor peep to die no one knew what had become of her till some days later when she was found dead in the meal
952,4830-25898-0031,with her poor little claws sticking straight up as if imploring help peck meanwhile got into mischief also
953,4830-25898-0032,she strayed into the sheep shed and finding some salt ate as much as she liked not knowing that salt is bad for hens having taken all she wanted she ran back to the barn
954,4830-25898-0033,and was innocently catching gnats when her mamma came out of the hay mow with a loud cut cut cut
955,4830-25898-0034,where is peep asked missus cluck
956,4830-25898-0035,there peck stopped suddenly rolled up her eyes and began to stagger about as if she was tipsy mercy on us what's the matter with the chick cried missus cluck in great alarm fits ma'am answered doctor drake
957,4830-25898-0036,who just then waddled by oh what can i do screamed the distracted hen nothing ma'am it's fatal and the doctor waddled on to visit dame partlet's son who was ill of the pip my child my child
958,4830-25898-0037,don't flap and stagger so let me hold you taste this mint leaf have a drop of water what shall i do as poor missus cluck sighed and sobbed her unhappy child went scuffling about on her back
959,4830-25898-0038,gasping and rolling up her eyes in great anguish for she had eaten too much of the fatal salt and there was no help for her when all was over they buried the dead chicken under a currant bush covered the little grave with chickweed
960,4830-25898-0039,and the bereaved parent wore a black string round her leg for a month blot the last of that bright band needed no mourning for she was as black as a crow this was the reason why her mother never
961,4830-25898-0040,had loved her as much as she did the others who were all white gray or yellow poor little blot had been much neglected by every one but now her lonely mamma discovered how good and affectionate a chicken she was
962,4830-25898-0041,for blot was a great comfort to her never running away or disobeying in any way but always close to her side ready to creep under her wing or bring her a plump bug when the poor biddy's appetite failed her
963,4830-25898-0042,they were very happy together till thanksgiving drew near when a dreadful pestilence seemed to sweep through the farm yard for turkeys hens ducks and geese fell a prey to it
964,4830-25898-0043,and were seen by their surviving relatives featherless pale and stiff borne away to some unknown place whence no fowl returned blot was waked one night by a great cackling and fluttering in the hen house
965,4830-25898-0044,and peeping down from her perch saw a great hand glide along the roost clutch her beloved mother by the leg and pull her off screaming dolefully
966,4830-25898-0045,aunt cockletop pecked and croaked fiercely but tough as she was the old biddy did not escape and many another amiable hen and gallant cockadoodle fell a victim to that mysterious hand
967,4830-25898-0046,in the morning few remained and blot felt that she was a forlorn orphan a thought which caused her to sit with her head under her wing for several hours brooding over her sad lot
968,4830-25898-0047,and longing to join her family in some safe and happy land where fowls live in peace she had her wish very soon for one day when the first snowflakes began to flutter
969,4830-25898-0048,blot saw a little kitten mewing pitifully as it sat under the fence what is the matter dear asked kind blot
970,4830-25898-0049,i live at the red farm house over the hill only i don't know which road to take i'll show you come at once for night is coming on and the snow will soon be too deep for us said blot so away they went
971,4830-25898-0050,but it was a long way and dusk came on before the red farm house appeared now i'm safe thank you very much won't you come in and stay all night my mother will be glad to see you
972,4830-25898-0051,said the kit rubbing her soft white face against blot's little black breast
973,4830-25898-0052,so good by dear and off trotted blot along the snowy road hoping to get home before the hen house door was shut faster and faster fell the snow darker and darker grew the night
974,4830-25898-0053,and colder and colder became poor blot's little feet as she waded through the drifts the firelight was shining out into the gloom
975,4830-25898-0054,to find all doors shut and no shelter left for her but the bough of a leafless tree too stiff and weak to fly up she crept as close as possible to the bright glow which shone across the door step
976,4830-25898-0055,and with a shiver put her little head under her wing trying to forget hunger weariness and the bitter cold and wait patiently for morning but when morning came little blot lay frozen stiff under a coverlet of snow
977,2893-139322-0000,chapter twenty one the under side from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufactures was done
978,2893-139322-0001,on their way the platforms crossed the thames twice and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid
979,2893-139322-0002,the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights a string of black barges passed seaward manned by blue clad men
980,2893-139322-0003,the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labour department was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks
981,2893-139322-0004,struck graham most vividly one lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut
982,2893-139322-0005,and blotted out the picture presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared
983,2893-139322-0006,the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuit making place of the potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers
984,2893-139322-0007,the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation
985,2893-139322-0008,but wherever there was work it was being done by slow moving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work places and the orange clad labour police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls
986,2893-139322-0009,the voluntary vigours of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter day workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen
987,2893-139322-0010,who were directing their labours the burly labourers of the old victorian times had followed that dray horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine
988,2893-139322-0011,the latter day labourer male as well as female was essentially a machine minder and feeder a servant and attendant or an artist under direction the women in comparison with those graham remembered
989,2893-139322-0012,were as a class distinctly plain and flat chested two hundred years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion two hundred years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigour from the blue canvas myriads
990,2893-139322-0013,to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendours and delights and at last
991,2893-139322-0014,to the euthanasy and peace to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities of graham's former life the newly aggregated labouring mass
992,2893-139322-0015,had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a high morality now it was differentiating into an instinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own even with a dialect of its own
993,2893-139322-0016,they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits
994,2893-139322-0017,the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways
995,2893-139322-0018,he came to the warren of the jewellers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree
996,2893-139322-0019,each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow
997,2893-139322-0020,had the oddest effect the work was beautifully executed
998,2893-139322-0021,for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this on coming to work but at night
999,2893-139322-0022,in spite of every precaution the labour policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby
1000,2893-139322-0023,many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion asano apologised to graham for this offensive sight but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route
1001,2893-139322-0024,this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement she might have done better with herself than that said asano
1002,2893-139322-0025,graham made some indignant comments but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years
1003,2893-139322-0026,and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen three barges smothered in floury dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar
1004,2893-139322-0027,by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white washed wall
1005,2893-139322-0028,every now and then one would stop to cough a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to graham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky
1006,2893-139322-0029,their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing stop that shouted one of the policemen but the order was disobeyed
1007,2893-139322-0030,and first one and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp
1008,2893-139322-0031,the policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things
1009,2893-139322-0032,that walk left on graham's mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery
1010,2893-139322-0033,the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pin point lights here was the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery
1011,2893-139322-0034,and here unprecedented reeks everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world
1012,2893-139322-0035,even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation once and again and again a third time
1013,2893-139322-0036,graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again
1014,2893-139322-0037,when he saw a number of blue clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labour police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder
1015,2893-139322-0038,but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms
1016,2893-139322-0039,they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices
1017,2893-139322-0040,then a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran what has happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting
1018,2893-139322-0041,that men yelled to one another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police
1019,2893-139322-0042,he hesitated looked at graham's face and told him the thing he already knew but how can they know asked asano graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work
1020,2893-139322-0043,and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms toward him bawling again and again in good english this is ostrog's doing ostrog the knave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse
1021,2893-139322-0044,he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream
1022,2893-139322-0045,he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past
1023,2893-139322-0046,the master is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent
1024,2893-139322-0047,he said i might have known the hour has come he thought swiftly what am i to do go back to the council house said asano why should i not appeal the people are here
1025,2893-139322-0048,you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them suppose this is only a rumour
1026,2893-139322-0049,it sounds true said asano let us have the facts said graham
1027,2893-139322-0050,even now the ruins may be impassable graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one and there asano accosted a labourer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech what did he say asked graham
1028,2893-139322-0051,had not someone in the wind vane offices learnt he said a girl a girl not he said a girl he did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins
1029,2893-139322-0052,and then another thing was shouted something that turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements it came like a wind along the street
1030,2893-139310-0000,the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was glowing
1031,2893-139310-0001,a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre
1032,2893-139310-0002,behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
1033,2893-139310-0003,a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch
1034,2893-139310-0004,and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly
1035,2893-139310-0005,he grasped the arm of this shouting person tell me he cried who am i who am i the others came nearer to hear his words
1036,2893-139310-0006,his eyes searched their faces they have told him nothing cried the girl tell me tell me cried graham you are the master of the earth you are owner of the world
1037,2893-139310-0007,he did not believe he heard aright he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i have been awake three days a prisoner three days
1038,2893-139310-0008,it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me
1039,2893-139310-0009,councillors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference
1040,2893-139310-0010,because you are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name the sounds from the hall had died into a silence
1041,2893-139310-0011,threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult a roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted
1042,2893-139310-0012,the people in the little room could not hear each other shout graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him
1043,2893-139310-0013,but who is ostrog he said
1044,2893-139310-0014,our leader in your name in my name
1045,2893-139310-0015,why is he not here he has deputed us i am his brother his half brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent
1046,2893-139310-0016,he is at the wind vane offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannised at last even in my name my name master
1047,2893-139310-0017,the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder
1048,2893-139310-0018,no one expected you to wake they were cunning damned tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotise you kill you again the hall dominated everything ostrog is at the wind vane offices ready
1049,2893-139310-0019,even now there is a rumour of fighting beginning the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him ostrog has it planned trust him we have our organisations ready we shall seize the flying stages
1050,2893-139310-0020,even now he may be doing that then this public theatre bawled the man in yellow is only a contingent we have five myriads of drilled men we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a leader
1051,2893-139310-0021,massed in the inaudible it is now or never the council is rocking they cannot trust even their drilled men hear the people calling to you graham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds
1052,2893-139310-0022,now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism
1053,2893-139310-0023,on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
1054,2893-139310-0024,monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him
1055,2893-139310-0025,but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him
1056,2893-139310-0026,and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were bawling for order silence
1057,2893-139310-0027,a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth
1058,2893-139310-0028,he met the wonder and expectation of the girl's eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed
1059,2893-139310-0029,but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of
1060,2893-139310-0030,lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song
1061,2893-139310-0031,the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music music like the music of an organ
1062,2893-139310-0032,full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating time tramp tramp he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically
1063,2893-139310-0033,the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred him emboldened him the hall opened to him
1064,2893-139310-0034,wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtly folding mantle hung from his shoulders
1065,2893-139310-0035,he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant she became to him flushed and eager as she was an embodiment of the song
1066,2893-139310-0036,he emerged in the alcove again incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting guided by lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people
1067,2893-139310-0037,the hall was a vast and intricate space galleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity
1068,2893-139310-0038,the whole multitude was swaying in congested masses individual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him momentarily and lost definition again close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by three men
1069,2893-139310-0039,her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff next this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind shouted a hairless face a great cavity of toothless mouth a voice called
1070,2893-139310-0040,ostrog all his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song the multitude were beating time with their feet marking time tramp tramp tramp tramp the green weapons waved
1071,2893-139310-0041,flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him passing towards a great archway shouting to the council tramp tramp tramp tramp he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled
1072,2893-139310-0042,march his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward they were no longer marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp tramp in that host
1073,2893-139310-0043,were bearded men old men youths fluttering robed bare armed women girls men and women of the new age rich robes grey rags fluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant blue
1074,2893-139310-0044,a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right he perceived a blue clad negro a shrivelled woman in yellow then a group of tall fair haired white faced blue clad men pushed theatrically past him he noted two chinamen
1075,2893-139310-0045,a tall sallow dark haired shining eyed youth white clad from top to toe clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down again and receded looking backward heads shoulders
1076,2893-139310-0046,hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there eyes met his and passed and vanished men gesticulated to him shouted inaudible personal things
1077,2893-139310-0047,most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly white and disease was there and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean men and women of the new age strange and incredible meeting as the broad stream passed before him to the right
1078,2893-139310-0048,tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people tramp tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages men and women
1079,2893-139310-0049,mingled in the ranks tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was tramping the garments waved onward the faces poured by more abundantly tramp tramp tramp tramp
1080,2893-139310-0050,at lincoln's pressure he turned towards the archway walking unconsciously in that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it the multitude the gesture and song all moved in that direction
1081,2893-139310-0051,the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet he was aware of a path before him of a suite about him of guards and dignities and lincoln on his right hand
1082,2893-139310-0052,attendants intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left before him went the backs of the guards in black three and three and three he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway
1083,2893-139310-0053,with the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up to him he did not know whither he went he did not want to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall
1084,78-369-0000,chapter twenty four my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury
1085,78-369-0001,my first resolution was to quit geneva forever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful
1086,78-369-0002,i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life
1087,78-369-0003,all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know
1088,78-369-0004,and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dared not die and leave my adversary in being when i quitted geneva my first labour
1089,78-369-0005,uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it
1090,78-369-0006,and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn
1091,78-369-0007,and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around
1092,78-369-0008,their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth
1093,78-369-0009,on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the daemon
1094,78-369-0010,which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work
1095,78-369-0011,deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends
1096,78-369-0012,heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance
1097,78-369-0013,it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains re echoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter
1098,78-369-0014,and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a well known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear
1099,78-369-0015,i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp
1100,78-369-0016,suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task
1101,78-369-0017,scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me
1102,78-369-0018,the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown
1103,78-369-0019,would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert
1104,78-369-0020,that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate
1105,78-369-0021,and vanish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the daemon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected
1106,78-369-0022,i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep
1107,78-369-0023,often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage
1108,78-369-0024,during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father
1109,78-369-0025,heard the silver tones of my elizabeth's voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come
1110,78-369-0026,and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonizing fondness did i feel for them
1111,78-369-0027,and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven
1112,78-369-0028,as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know
1113,78-369-0029,these words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north
1114,78-369-0030,where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare
1115,78-369-0031,again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy
1116,78-369-0032,the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice
1117,78-369-0033,and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours
1118,78-369-0034,one inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings
1119,78-369-0035,will satisfy my everlasting hatred my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words
1120,78-369-0036,and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon
1121,78-369-0037,oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness
1122,78-369-0038,the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down
1123,78-369-0039,and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversary's gibe to meet and grapple with him
1124,78-369-0040,some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed
1125,78-369-0041,and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants
1126,78-369-0042,concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage
1127,78-369-0043,through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs
1128,78-369-0044,he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured
1129,78-369-0045,amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant
1130,78-369-0046,my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge
1131,78-369-0047,i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment
1132,78-369-0048,which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
1133,78-369-0049,i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes
1134,78-369-0050,despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil
1135,78-369-0051,gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain
1136,78-369-0052,what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within
1137,78-369-0053,warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the daemon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until
1138,78-369-0054,when for a short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey
1139,78-369-0055,my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before
1140,78-369-0056,as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy
1141,78-369-0057,and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death
1142,78-369-0058,several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor
1143,78-369-0059,i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship
1144,78-369-0060,but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled
1145,78-369-0061,oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the daemon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do
1146,78-369-0062,swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no
1147,78-369-0063,sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish
1148,78-368-0000,chapter twenty three it was eight o'clock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn
1149,78-368-0001,the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend
1150,78-368-0002,the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves
1151,78-368-0003,that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects
1152,78-368-0004,and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence
1153,78-368-0005,when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended
1154,78-368-0006,i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant
1155,78-368-0007,great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope
1156,78-368-0008,she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form
1157,78-368-0009,flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated
1158,78-368-0010,but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them
1159,78-368-0011,to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her
1160,78-368-0012,but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck
1161,78-368-0013,and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described
1162,78-368-0014,i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife
1163,78-368-0015,but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room
1164,78-368-0016,nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless
1165,78-368-0017,after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house
1166,78-368-0018,a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room
1167,78-368-0019,as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it
1168,78-368-0020,and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind
1169,78-368-0021,subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine
1170,78-368-0022,the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend
1171,78-368-0023,my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action
1172,78-368-0024,there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents
1173,78-368-0025,however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night
1174,78-368-0026,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man
1175,78-368-0027,but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate
1176,78-368-0028,know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted
1177,78-368-0029,and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore
1178,78-368-0030,misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way
1179,78-368-0031,sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered
1180,78-368-0032,melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation
1181,78-368-0033,the monster whom i had created the miserable daemon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him
1182,78-368-0034,and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great
1183,78-368-0035,revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose
1184,78-368-0036,and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer
1185,78-368-0037,however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood
1186,78-368-0038,my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive
1187,78-368-0039,and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy
1188,78-368-0040,and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested
1189,78-368-0041,when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power
1190,78-368-0042,from the execution of those functions on this occasion
1191,78-368-0043,i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance
1192,78-368-0044,who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude
1193,78-368-0045,since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit
1194,78-368-0046,and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative
1195,78-368-0047,and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he
1196,78-368-0048,i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you
1197,78-368-0049,have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be
1198,78-368-0050,but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice
1199,78-368-0051,my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction
1200,78-368-0052,i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed
1201,78-368-0053,how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease
1202,4853-29413-0000,gloody settles the account a night of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreams this was what i might have expected and this is what really happened
1203,4853-29413-0001,the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon i rang my bell
1204,4853-29413-0002,the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom
1205,4853-29413-0003,the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me gloody showed himself at the door
1206,4853-29413-0004,with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel if you bring me bad news i said don't keep me waiting for it it's nothing that need trouble you sir
1207,4853-29413-0005,i'm dismissed from my master's service that's all it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside do you believe that i mean well by you i asked
1208,4853-29413-0006,what did he do flew into a furious rage i don't complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i can't look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window
1209,4853-29413-0007,even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mister roylake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if i hadn't had something else to tell you only i don't know how
1210,4853-29413-0008,in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say is that kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us two is settled now on both sides
1211,4853-29413-0009,what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause
1212,4853-29413-0010,we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness he considered a little
1213,4853-29413-0011,the magistrate would put questions to me wouldn't he sir very good you put questions to me and i'll answer them to the best of my ability
1214,4853-29413-0012,the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alone sometimes when he was asleep and dreaming
1215,4853-29413-0013,the cur had betrayed himself it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasure as i did now in thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested
1216,4853-29413-0014,to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouse and he had failed
1217,4853-29413-0015,but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned
1218,4853-29413-0016,gloody was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the tea party
1219,4853-29413-0017,a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time
1220,4853-29413-0018,that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain
1221,4853-29413-0019,it was borne in on my mind sir and that's all i can tell you he said i didn't dare speak to you about it you wouldn't have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police
1222,4853-29413-0020,the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of you i don't mean any offence sir i pretty well guessed
1223,4853-29413-0021,that she was true as steel and not easily frightened i didn't need to guess i knew it gloody had done his best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded
1224,4853-29413-0022,she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen
1225,4853-29413-0023,whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea yes well that was one of the signals agreed on between us
1226,4853-29413-0024,how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them
1227,4853-29413-0025,i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said
1228,4853-29413-0026,i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was honest honestly frightened i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor
1229,4853-29413-0027,a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we hav'n't heard of yet mister roylake i had been dressing for some time past longing to see cristel it is needless to say
1230,4853-29413-0028,is there anything more i asked that i ought to know only one thing mister roylake that i can think of gloody replied i'm afraid it's miss cristel's turn next what do you mean
1231,4853-29413-0029,while the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on miss cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boat house somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars
1232,4853-29413-0030,i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars
1233,4853-29413-0031,had we any proof to justify us gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boat house no oars no oars
1234,4853-29413-0032,and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me nothing sir
1235,4853-27670-0000,i lay for a long while insensible and that i should have recovered my mind instead of dying in that swoon i must ever account as the greatest wonder of a life that has not been wanting in the marvellous
1236,4853-27670-0001,i had no sooner sat up than all that had happened and my present situation instantly came to me my hair was stiff with ice there was no more feeling in my hands than had they been of stone
1237,4853-27670-0002,my clothes weighed upon me like a suit of armour so inflexibly hard were they frozen yet i got upon my legs and found that i could stand and walk and that life flowed warm in my veins
1238,4853-27670-0003,it was intensely dark the binnacle lamp was extinguished and the light in the cabin burned too dimly to throw the faintest colour upon the hatchway one thing i quickly noticed that the gale had broken and blew no more than a fresh breeze
1239,4853-27670-0004,there was less spite in its wash less fury in its blow the multitudinous roaring of the heaving blackness had sobered into a hard and sullen growling a sound as of thunder among mountains heard in a valley
1240,4853-27670-0005,the brig pitched and rolled heavily much of the buoyancy of her earlier dance was gone out of her nevertheless i could not persuade myself that this sluggishness was altogether due to the water she had taken in
1241,4853-27670-0006,it was wonderful however that she should still be afloat no man could have heard the rending and grating of her side against the ice without supposing that every plank in it was being torn out
1242,4853-27670-0007,finding that i had the use of my voice i holloaed as loudly as i could but no human note responded three or four times i shouted giving some of the people their names but in vain father of mercy i thought
1243,4853-27670-0008,what has come to pass is it possible that all my companions have been washed overboard certainly five men at least were living before we fouled the ice and again i cried out is there any one alive
1244,4853-27670-0009,my loneliness was more terrible to me than any other condition of my situation it was dreadful to be standing nearly dead with cold in utter darkness
1245,4853-27670-0010,it was dreadful i say to be thus placed and to feel that i was in the heart of the rudest most desolate space of sea in the world into which the commerce of the earth dispatched but few ships all the year round
1246,4853-27670-0011,but no feature of my lamentable situation so affrighted me so worked upon the passions of my mind as my loneliness oh for one companion
1247,4853-27670-0012,even one only to make me an echo for mine own speech nay god himself the merciful father of all even he seemed not the blackness lay like a pall upon the deep and upon my soul
1248,4853-27670-0013,misery and horror were within that shadow and beyond it nothing that my spirit could look up to i stood for some moments as one stunned and then my manhood trained to some purpose by the usage of the sea
1249,4853-27670-0014,reasserted itself and maybe i also got some slender comfort from observing that dull and heavy as was the motion of the brig there was yet the buoyancy of vitality in her manner of mounting the seas and that after all
1250,4853-27670-0015,her case might not be so desperate as was threatened by the way in which she had been torn and precipitated past the iceberg at moments when she plunged the whiteness of the water creaming upon the surges on either hand
1251,4853-27670-0016,by preventing the seas which washed on to the forecastle from cascading with their former violence aft also that the whole length of the main and top masts lay upon the larboard rail and over the side
1252,4853-27670-0017,my eyes directly sought it and found the time twenty minutes after ten this signified that i had ten or eleven hours of darkness before me
1253,4853-27670-0018,i took down the lamp trimmed it and went to the lazarette hatch at the after end of the cabin here were kept the stores for the crew
1254,4853-27670-0019,i swallowed half a pannikin of the hollands for the sake of the warmth and life of the draught and entering my cabin put on thick dry stockings first chafing my feet till i felt the blood in them
1255,4853-27670-0020,and i then with a seaman's dispatch shifted the rest of my apparel and cannot express how greatly i was comforted by the change though the jacket and trousers i put on were still damp with the soaking of previous days
1256,4853-27670-0021,i took from the captain's cabin a stout cloak and threw it over me enveloping my head which i had cased in a warm fur cap with the hood of it and thus equipped i lighted a small hand lantern that was used on dark nights for heaving the log
1257,4853-27670-0022,nevertheless its rays suffered me to guess at the picture of ruin the decks offered the main mast was snapped three or four feet above the deck and the stump of it showed as jagged and barbed as a wild beast's teeth
1258,4853-27670-0023,but i now noticed that the weight of the hamper being on the larboard side balanced the list the vessel took from her shifted ballast and that she floated on a level keel with her bows fair at the sea
1259,4853-27670-0024,i moved with extreme caution casting the lantern light before me sometimes starting at a sound that resembled a groan then stopping to steady myself during some particular wild leap of the hull
1260,4853-27670-0025,until coming abreast of the main hatch the rays of the lantern struck upon a man's body which on my bringing the flame to his face proved to be captain rosy there was a wound over his right brow
1261,4853-27670-0026,and as if that had not sufficed to slay him the fall of the masts had in some wonderful manner whipped a rope several times round his body binding his arms and encircling his throat so tightly
1262,4853-27670-0027,that no executioner could have gone more artistically to work to pinion and choke a man under a mass of rigging in the larboard scuppers lay two bodies as i could just faintly discern
1263,4853-27670-0028,for they lay under a whole body of shrouds complicated by a mass of other gear against which leaned a portion of the caboose i viewed them long enough to satisfy my mind that they were dead and then with a heart of lead turned away
1264,4853-27670-0029,i crossed to the starboard side where the deck was comparatively clear and found the body of a seaman named abraham wise near the fore hatch
1265,4853-27670-0030,no language that i have command of could put before you the horror that possessed me as i sat meditating upon my situation and recalling the faces of the dead the wind was rapidly falling and with it the sea
1266,4853-27670-0031,but the motion of the brig continued very heavy a large swell having been set running by the long fierce gale that was gone and there being no uproar of tempest in the sky to confound the senses
1267,4853-27670-0032,i could hear a hundred harsh and melancholy groaning and straining sounds rising from the hull with now and again a mighty blow as from some spar or lump of ice alongside weighty enough you would have supposed to stave the ship
1268,4853-27670-0033,nevertheless her continuing to float in her miserably torn and mangled condition was so great a miracle that spite of my poor shipmates having perished and my own state being as hopeless as the sky was starless
1269,4853-27670-0034,to judge by the sound of the quantity of water in the vessel that she was filling i knew well yet not leaking so rapidly but that had our crew been preserved we might easily have kept her free
1270,4853-27670-0035,i had noticed the jolly boat bottom up near the starboard gangway and so far as i could make out by throwing the dull lantern light upon her she was sound but i could not have launched her without seeing what i was doing
1271,4853-27670-0036,and even had i managed this she stood to be swamped and i to be drowned
1272,4853-27671-0000,there were a few stars dying out in the dark west the atmosphere was clear and when the sun rose i knew he would turn the sable pall overhead into blueness the hull lay very deep
1273,4853-27671-0001,i had at one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise
1274,4853-27671-0002,and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail
1275,4853-27671-0003,yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow
1276,4853-27671-0004,one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks
1277,4853-27671-0005,had floated the jolly boat out of the long boat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell
1278,4853-27671-0006,and there lay the long boat crushed into staves this signal and surprising intervention filled my heart with thankfulness though my spirits sank again at the sight of my poor drowned shipmates
1279,4853-27671-0007,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prised her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers
1280,4853-27671-0008,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water
1281,4853-27671-0009,but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her
1282,4853-27671-0010,i ran to the cabin but the lazarette was full of water and none of the provisions in it to be come at i thereupon ransacked the cabin and found a whole dutch cheese a piece of raw pork half a ham
1283,4853-27671-0011,eight or ten biscuits some candles a tinder box several lemons a little bag of flower and thirteen bottles of beer these things i rolled up in a cloth and placed them in the boat
1284,4853-27671-0012,the heavy sluggish sodden movement of the hull advised me to make haste she was now barely lifting to the swell that came brimming in broad liquid blue brows to her stem
1285,4853-27671-0013,it seemed as though another ton of water would sink her and if the swell fell over her bows and filled the decks down she would go i had a small parcel of guineas in my chest and was about to fetch this money
1286,4853-27671-0014,when a sort of staggering sensation in the upward slide of the hull gave me a fright and watching my chance i jumped into the boat and cast the line that held her adrift the sun was an hour above the horizon
1287,4853-27671-0015,heaving very slowly though you felt the weight of the mighty ocean in every fold and eastwards the shoulders of the swell catching the glorious reflection of the sun hurled the splendour along
1288,4853-27671-0016,till all that quarter of the sea looked to be a mass of leaping dazzle upon the eastern sea line lay a range of white clouds compact as the chalk cliffs of dover
1289,4853-27671-0017,shot with pearly lustre floated overhead very high it was in truth a fair and pleasant morning of an icy coldness indeed but the air being dry its shrewdness was endurable
1290,4853-27671-0018,with us had it dawned yesterday instead of to day my companions would have been alive and yonder sinking ruined fabric a trim ship capable of bearing us stoutly into warm seas and to our homes at last
1291,4853-27671-0019,i threw the oar over the stern of the boat to keep her near to the brig not so much because i desired to see the last of her
1292,4853-27671-0020,into those prodigious leagues of ocean which lay stretched under the sky whilst the hull floated she was something to hold on to so to say something for the eye amid the vastness of water to rest upon
1293,4853-27671-0021,and her main deck blew up with a loud clap or blast of noise i could follow the line of her bulwarks fluctuating and waving in the clear dark blue when she was some feet under
1294,4853-27671-0022,and which she dragged down with her on a sudden when the last fragment of mast had disappeared and when the hollows of the whirlpools were flattening to the level surface of the sea up rose a body with a sort of leap
1295,4853-27671-0023,it was the sailor that had lain drowned on the starboard side of the forward deck being frozen stiff he rose in the posture in which he had expired that is with his arms extended
1296,4853-27671-0024,so that when he jumped to the surface he came with his hands lifted up to heaven and thus he stayed a minute sustained by the eddies which also revolved him the shock occasioned by this melancholy object was so great
1297,4853-27671-0025,and such was the state of my mind that imagination might quickly have worked the apparition had it lingered into an instrument for the unsettling of my reason i rose from the seat on to which i had sunk and loosed the sail
1298,4853-27671-0026,and hauling the sheet aft put the oar over the stern and brought the little craft's head to an easterly course the draught of air was extremely weak and scarce furnished impulse enough to the sail to raise a bubble alongside
1299,4853-27671-0027,the boat was about fifteen feet long
1300,4853-27671-0028,ere i could heave a civilized coast or a habitable island into view at the start i had a mind to steer north west and blow as the wind would suffer into the south sea
1301,4853-27671-0029,where perchance i might meet a whaler or a southseaman from new holland but my heart sank at the prospect of the leagues of water which rolled between me and the islands and the western american seaboard indeed
1302,4853-27671-0030,i understood that my only hope of deliverance lay in being picked up and that though by heading east i should be clinging to the stormy parts i was more likely to meet with a ship hereabouts
1303,4853-27671-0031,than by sailing into the great desolation of the north west the burden of my loneliness weighed down upon me so crushingly that i cannot but consider my senses must have been somewhat dulled by suffering
1304,4853-27671-0032,i am persuaded my heart must have broken and that i should have died of grief faintly as the wind blew it speedily wafted me out of sight of the floating relics of the wreck
1305,4853-27671-0033,and then all was bare bald swelling sea and empearled sky darkening in lagoons of azure down to the soft mountainous masses of white vapour lying like the coast of a continent on the larboard horizon
1306,4853-27671-0034,but one living thing there was besides myself a grey breasted albatross of a princely width of pinion i had not observed it till the hull went down and then
1307,4853-27671-0035,lifting my eyes with involuntary sympathy in the direction pointed to by the upraised arms of the sailor i observed the great royal bird hanging like a shape of marble directly over the frothing eddies
1308,4853-27671-0036,it was as though the spirit of the deep had taken form in the substance of the noblest of all the fowls of its dominions and poised on tremorless wings
1309,4853-27671-0037,was surveying with the cold curiosity of an intelligence empty of human emotion the destruction of one of those fabrics whose unequal contests and repeated triumphs had provoked its haughty surprise
1310,4853-27671-0038,the bird quitted the spot of the wreck after a while and followed me its eyes had the sparkling blood red gleam of rubies
1311,4853-27671-0039,it was as silent as a phantom and with arched neck and motionless plumes seemed to watch me with an earnestness that presently grew insufferable so far from finding any comfort of companionship in the creature
1312,4853-27671-0040,it uttered a strange salt cry the very note of a gust of wind splitting upon a rope flapped its wings and after a turn or two
1313,4018-107338-0000,morley paused as he recognised egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
1314,4018-107338-0001,perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things
1315,4018-107338-0002,and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
1316,4018-107338-0003,and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears
1317,4018-107338-0004,and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies
1318,4018-107338-0005,that appearance was prepossessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
1319,4018-107338-0006,detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced
1320,4018-107338-0007,is the privilege of the people of whom i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour their labour said sybil
1321,4018-107338-0008,is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
1322,4018-107338-0009,then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing
1323,4018-107338-0010,he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
1324,4018-107338-0011,this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
1325,4018-107338-0012,he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me
1326,4018-107338-0013,he would propose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here
1327,4018-107338-0014,you did well good stephen as you always do said sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
1328,4018-107338-0015,hers were kind and calm and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
1329,4018-107338-0016,the mystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sybil there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here today he met and addressed me and i only recognised an acquaintance
1330,4018-107338-0017,had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
1331,4018-107338-0018,you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil
1332,4018-107338-0019,he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
1333,4018-107338-0020,and yet if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
1334,4018-107338-0021,the factions become united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
1335,4018-107338-0022,you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well
1336,4018-107338-0023,but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet
1337,4018-107338-0024,morley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
1338,4018-107338-0025,lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to degrade them
1339,4018-107338-0026,there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephen's itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
1340,4018-107338-0027,my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believed that we had on our side god and truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley
1341,4018-107338-0028,the factions and the failures of our oppressors at this moment gerard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of sybil and morley
1342,4018-107338-0029,saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of justice that mowbray castle is as much yours
1343,4018-107338-0030,as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord's land but can we prove it we never had the legal evidence you are in error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda
1344,4018-107338-0031,very useful no doubt i hope i shall find them but of no validity if money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter
1345,4018-107338-0032,i'll not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely fit for business
1346,4018-103416-0000,the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one it was marked by an almost feverish gayety as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self interest
1347,4018-103416-0001,mills and factories took on new life labor was scarce and high it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure people played that they might not think washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved
1348,4018-103416-0002,kept its secret well and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce war was to most of the nation a great dramatic spectacle presented to them at breakfast and in the afternoon editions
1349,4018-103416-0003,for the red cross and kindred activities but although the war was in the nation's mind it was not yet in its soul life went on much as before an abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency
1350,4018-103416-0004,the great six months battle of the somme with its million casualties was resulting favorably on the east the russians had made some gains there were wagers that the germans would be done in the spring
1351,4018-103416-0005,but again washington knew that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful that the amount of lost territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the british islands was acute
1352,4018-103416-0006,that the submarine sinkings were colossal our peace was at a fearful cost and on the edge of this volcano america played when graham spencer left the mill that tuesday afternoon it was to visit marion hayden
1353,4018-103416-0007,he was rather bored now at the prospect he would have preferred going to the club to play billiards which was his custom of a late afternoon he drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed marion's invitation to get there before the crowd
1354,4018-103416-0008,three cars before the house showed that she already had callers and indeed when the parlor maid opened the door a burst of laughter greeted him the hayden house was a general rendezvous there were usually by seven o'clock whiskey and soda glasses
1355,4018-103416-0009,and tea cups on most of the furniture and half smoked cigarets on everything that would hold them including the piano marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing room door
1356,4018-103416-0010,i kept the library as long as i could we can sit on the stairs if you like which they proceeded to do quite amiably from various open doors came subdued voices the air was pungent with tobacco smoke
1357,4018-103416-0011,permeated with a faint scent of late afternoon highballs tommy marion called when she had settled herself yes from a distance did you leave your cigaret on the piano
1358,4018-103416-0012,no toots dear but i can easily mother marion explained
1359,4018-103416-0013,well do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night not exactly but i meant them he looked up at her admiringly he was only a year from college and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debutantes
1360,4018-103416-0014,since the night before he had been rankling under a sense of youth was i pretty awful last night he asked you were very interesting and i imagine rather indiscreet
1361,4018-103416-0015,about the new war contracts oh business
1362,4018-103416-0016,and i like big figures poor people always do has it really gone through i mean those things do slip up sometimes don't they it's gone through all right signed sealed and delivered
1363,4018-103416-0017,encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder
1364,4018-103416-0018,her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marion hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had
1365,4018-103416-0019,was the beauty of youth only and that that was going late hours golf perhaps a little more champagne than was necessary at dinners and the mornings found her almost plain and too
1366,4018-103416-0020,she had the far vision of the calculating mind she knew that if the country entered the war every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer at twenty five she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers
1367,4018-103416-0021,were now sending flowers to the debutantes and cutting in on the younger men at balls her house was still a rendezvous but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room the library and the music room that afternoon
1368,4018-103416-0022,they met there smoked her cigarets made love in a corner occasionally became engaged but she was of the game no longer in it men still came to see her a growing percentage of them married
1369,4018-103416-0023,they brought or sent her tribute flowers candy and cigarets
1370,4018-103416-0024,but more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd like natalie spencer's stupid party the night before so she watched graham and listened he was a nice boy and a handsome one
1371,4018-103416-0025,also he promised to be sole heir to a great business if the war only lasted long enough imagine your knowing all those things she said admiringly you're a partner aren't you he flushed slightly
1372,4018-103416-0026,not yet but of course i shall be when you really get going i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made i'm the most ignorant person you ever knew i'll be awfully glad to
1373,4018-103416-0027,we'll go in and stir up some of the lovers she suggested and if tommy hale hasn't burned up the piano we can dance a bit you dance divinely you know it was after seven when he reached home he felt every inch a man
1374,4018-103416-0028,he held himself very straight as he entered the house and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler had given place to a dignified nod natalie was in her dressing room at his knock she told the maid to admit him
1375,4018-103416-0029,his new found maturity seemed to be slipping from him somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy honestly mother i'd rather go to father and tell him about it
1376,4018-103416-0030,she ignored his protest as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters i'm accustomed to it was her sole reply but her resigned voice brought her as it always had
1377,4018-103416-0031,the ready tribute of the boy's sympathy sit down graham i want to talk to you he sat down still uneasily fingering the roll of bills
1378,4018-103416-0032,when at a sound in clayton's room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket have you noticed a change in your father since he came back her tone was so ominous that he started he's not sick is he
1379,4018-103416-0033,she was holding out both hands to him piteously you wouldn't go would you i might have to go he evaded you wouldn't graham you're all i have all i have left to live for you wouldn't need to go it's ridiculous you're needed here
1380,4018-103416-0034,your father needs you he needs me the hell of a lot the boy muttered but he went over and stooping down kissed her trembling face don't worry about me he said lightly i don't think we've got spine enough to get into the mix up anyhow
1381,4018-103416-0035,and if we have you won't go promise me you won't go when he hesitated she resorted to her old methods with both clayton and the boy she was doing all she could to make them happy she made no demands none
1382,4018-103416-0036,but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received graham listened
1383,4018-103416-0037,she was a really pathetic figure crouched in her low chair and shaken with terror she must have rather a bad time there were so many things she dared not take to his father she brought them to him instead her small grievances
1384,4018-103416-0038,and she had helped him out of a hole just now all right i promise he said at last but you're worrying yourself for nothing mother she was quite content then cheered at once consulted the jewelled watch on her dressing table
1385,4018-107312-0000,the chief street of mowbray called castle street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its neighbourhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence
1386,4018-107312-0001,the dimensions of castle street were not unworthy of the metropolis it traversed a great portion of the town and was proportionately wide its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity
1387,4018-107312-0002,while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses not as beautiful as the palaces of venice but in their way not less remarkable magnificent shops and here and there though rarely some ancient factory built among the fields
1388,4018-107312-0003,in the infancy of mowbray by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labours
1389,4018-107312-0004,would be the future eye sore of a flourishing posterity pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile gerard and stephen turned down a street which intersected it
1390,4018-107312-0005,and so on through a variety of ways and winding lanes till they arrived at an open portion of the town a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack looking buildings
1391,4018-107312-0006,that rose in all directions clustering yet isolated announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of mowbray crossing this open ground they gained a suburb but one of a very different description
1392,4018-107312-0007,to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with sybil this one was populous noisy and lighted it was saturday night the streets were thronged an infinite population kept swarming to and fro
1393,4018-107312-0008,by narrow archways like the entrance of hives so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission while ascending to these same streets from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps
1394,4018-107312-0009,the subterraneous nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest the bright and lively shops were crowded and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls
1395,4018-107312-0010,still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase and so it is widow said a little pale man wistfully come come it's getting late and your wife's ill you're a good soul
1396,4018-107312-0011,or the mayor of mowbray at least wages said the man i wish you may get em those villains shuffle and screw have sarved me with another bate ticket and a pretty figure too
1397,4018-107312-0012,oh the carnal monsters exclaimed the widow if their day don't come the bloody minded knaves and for small cops too small cops be hanged am i the man to send up a bad bottomed cop widow carey
1398,4018-107312-0013,you sent up for snicks i have known you man and boy john hill these twenty summers and never heard a word against you till you got into shuffle and screw's mill oh they are a bad yarn john
1399,4018-107312-0014,they do us all widow they pretends to give the same wages as the rest and works it out in fines you can't come and you can't go but there's a fine you're never paid wages but there's a bate ticket
1400,4018-107312-0015,i've heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines soul alive but those shuffle and screw are rotten snickey bad yarns said mistress carey
1401,4018-107312-0016,weal indeed you look very like a soul as feeds on weal continued missus carey in an under tone as her declining customer moved away well it gets late said the widow
1402,4018-107312-0017,and if you like to take this scrag end home to your wife neighbour hill we can talk of the rest next saturday and what's your will sir said the widow with a stern expression to a youth who now stopped at her stall
1403,4018-107312-0018,he was about sixteen with a lithe figure and a handsome faded impudent face his long loose white trousers gave him height he had no waistcoat but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck
1404,4018-107312-0019,a high crowned dark brown hat which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye well you need not be so fierce mother carey said the youth with an affected air of deprecation
1405,4018-107312-0020,don't mother me said the jolly widow with a kindling eye go to your own mother who is dying in a back cellar without a winder while you've got lodgings in a two pair dying she's only drunk said the youth
1406,4018-107312-0021,what makes her drink but toil working from five o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night and for the like of such as you that's a good one said the youth i should like to know what my mother ever did for me but give me treacle and laudanum when i was a babby
1407,4018-107312-0022,to stop my tongue and fill my stomach by the token of which as my gal says she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all mowbray and here the youth drew himself up and thrust his hands in the side pockets of his pea jacket well
1408,4018-107312-0023,i never said missus carey no i never heard a thing like that what not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for veal cutlets mother hold your tongue mister imperence said the widow it's very well known you're no christian and who'll believe what you say
1409,4018-107312-0024,it's very well known that i'm a man what pays his way said the boy and don't keep a huckster's stall to sell carrion by star light but live in a two pair if you please and has a wife and family or as good
1410,4018-107312-0025,said a good humoured voice it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped they were gaily dressed a light handkerchief tied under the chin their hair scrupulously arranged they wore coral neck laces and earrings of gold
1411,4018-107312-0026,she added in a lower tone well i have left mister trafford's mill said the girl that's a bad job said missus carey for those traffords are kind to their people
1412,4018-107312-0027,so it is said the girl but then it was so dull i can't stand a country life missus carey i must have company well i do love a bit of gossip myself said missus carey with great frankness
1413,4018-107312-0028,and then i'm no scholar said the girl and never could take to learning and those traffords had so many schools learning is better than house and land said missus carey though i'm no scholar myself but then in my time things was different
1414,4018-107312-0029,but young persons yes said mick i don't think i could get through the day if it wurno for our institute and what's that asked missus carey with a sneer the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure said mick
1415,4018-107312-0030,we have got fifty members and take in three london papers one northern star and two moral worlds and where are you now child continued the widow to the girl
1416,4018-107312-0031,if you will take a dish of tea with us to morrow we expect some friends i take it kindly said missus carey and so you keep house together all the children keep house in these days times is changed indeed
1417,4018-107312-0032,and we shall be happy to see you mick and julia if you are not engaged continued the girl and she looked at her friend a pretty demure girl who immediately said but in a somewhat faultering tone oh that we shall
1418,4018-107312-0033,well we had no thoughts but i said to harriet as it is a fine night let us walk about as long as we can and then to morrow we will lie in bed till afternoon
1419,4018-107312-0034,but at this season of the year i must have life the moment i came out i bathed in the river and then went home and dressed he added in a satisfied tone and now i am going to the temple i'll tell you what julia has been pricked to day with a shuttle
1420,4018-107312-0035,i'll stand treat and take you and your friend to the temple well that's delight said caroline there's no one does the handsome thing like you dandy mick and i always say so oh i love the temple tis so genteel
1421,4018-107312-0036,i was speaking of it to harriet last night
1422,4018-107312-0037,i proposed to go with her but two girls alone you understand me one does not like to be seen in these places as if one kept no company very true said mick and now we'll be off good night widow
1423,7067-76047-0000,after twenty four eventful hours our two students of human motives found themselves together again by the fireplace in the old george smoking room they had resumed their overnight conversation in a state of considerable tension
1424,7067-76047-0001,a broad and original thinker as you are thought is one matter rash inconsiderate action quite another and above all if i spend another day in or near the company of miss
1425,7067-76047-0002,and bit his lower lip and considered we might drop belinda he suggested turning to his friend and speaking in low confidential tones she is quite a manageable person quite
1426,7067-76047-0003,she could for example be left behind with the luggage and sent on by train i do not know if you realize how the land lies in that quarter it needs only a word to miss grammont there was no immediate reply
1427,7067-76047-0004,for a moment he had a wild hope that his companion would agree and then he perceived that the doctor's silence meant only the preparation of an ultimatum i object to miss grammont and that side of the thing more than i do to miss seyffert
1428,7067-76047-0005,sir richmond said nothing it may help you to see this affair from a slightly different angle if i tell you that twice today miss seyffert has asked me if you were a married man and of course you told her i was
1429,7067-76047-0006,on the second occasion sir richmond smiled again frankly said the doctor this adventure is altogether uncongenial to me it is the sort of thing that has never happened in my life this highway coupling
1430,7067-76047-0007,don't you think said sir richmond that you are attaching rather too much what shall i say romantic flirtatious meaning to this affair
1431,7067-76047-0008,but isn't your attitude rather unfair unjust indeed and almost insulting to this miss grammont after all she's a young lady of very good social position indeed
1432,7067-76047-0009,she doesn't strike you does she as an undignified or helpless human being her manners suggest a person of considerable self control and knowing less of me than you do she probably regards me as almost as safe as a maiden aunt say
1433,7067-76047-0010,i'm twice her age we are a party of four there are conventions there are considerations aren't you really my dear martineau overdoing all this side of this very pleasant little enlargement of our interests
1434,7067-76047-0011,am i said doctor martineau and brought a scrutinizing eye to bear on sir richmond's face i want to go on talking to miss grammont for a day or so sir richmond admitted then i shall prefer to leave your party
1435,7067-76047-0012,there were some moments of silence i am really very sorry to find myself in this dilemma said sir richmond with a note of genuine regret in his voice it is not a dilemma said doctor martineau with a corresponding loss of asperity
1436,7067-76047-0013,i grant you we discover we differ upon a question of taste and convenience but before i suggested this trip i had intended to spend a little time with my old friend sir kenelm latter at bournemouth nothing simpler than to go to him now
1437,7067-76047-0014,i shall be sorry all the same i could have wished said the doctor that these ladies had happened a little later the matter was settled nothing more of a practical nature remained to be said
1438,7067-76047-0015,but neither gentleman wished to break off with a harsh and bare decision when the new age is here said sir richmond then surely a friendship between a man and a woman will not be subjected to the the inconveniences your present code would set about it
1439,7067-76047-0016,and honour than they have ever been before in matters of property economics and public conduct it will probably be just the reverse then there will be much more collective control and much more insistence legal insistence upon individual responsibility
1440,7067-76047-0017,but we are not living in a new age yet we are living in the patched up ruins of a very old one and you if you will forgive me are living in the patched up remains of a life that had already had its complications
1441,7067-76047-0018,this young lady whose charm and cleverness i admit behaves as if the new age were already here well that may be a very dangerous mistake both for her and for you this affair if it goes on for a few days more
1442,7067-76047-0019,may involve very serious consequences indeed with which i for one do not wish to be involved sir richmond upon the hearthrug had a curious feeling that he was back in the head master's study at caxton
1443,7067-76047-0020,and in many ways interesting i have been watching her i have not been favoured with very much of her attention but that fact has enabled me to see her in profile
1444,7067-76047-0021,miss seyffert is a fairly crude mixture of frankness insincerity and self explanatory egotism and i have been able to disregard a considerable amount of the conversation she has addressed to me
1445,7067-76047-0022,now i guess this miss grammont has had no mother since she was quite little your guesses doctor are apt to be pretty good said sir richmond you know that she has told me as much
1446,7067-76047-0023,well she impressed me as having the air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions that is how i inferred that there was no mother i don't think there has been any stepmother
1447,7067-76047-0024,her manner with miss seyffert an excellent manner for miss seyffert by the bye isn't the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day or for one person only she is a very sure and commanding young woman sir richmond nodded
1448,7067-76047-0025,i suppose her father adores and neglects her and whenever she has wanted a companion or governess butchered the thing has been done these business americans i am told neglect their womenkind give them money and power let them loose on the world
1449,7067-76047-0026,it is a sort of moral laziness masquerading as affection still i suppose custom and tradition kept this girl in her place and she was petted honoured amused
1450,7067-76047-0027,talked about but not in a harmful way and rather bored right up to the time when america came into the war theoretically she had a tremendously good time i think this must be near the truth of her biography said sir richmond
1451,7067-76047-0028,i mean that she was surrounded by a retinue of men who wanted to marry her or who behaved as though they wanted to marry her or who made her happiness and her gratifications and her condescensions seem a matter of very great importance to them
1452,7067-76047-0029,she had the flattery of an extremely uncritical and unexacting admiration that is the sort of thing that gratifies a silly woman extremely miss grammont is not silly
1453,7067-76047-0030,probably bored her more than she realized to anyone too intelligent to be steadily excited by buying things and wearing things and dancing and playing games and going to places of entertainment and being given flowers sweets jewellery
1454,7067-76047-0031,and that she had already read and thought rather more than most young women in her position before she was twenty i guess she was already looking for something more interesting in the way of men than a rich admirer with an automobile full of presents those who seek find
1455,7067-76047-0032,what do you think she found what would a rich girl find out there in america i don't know i haven't the material to guess with in london a girl might find a considerable variety of active interesting men rising politicians university men of distinction
1456,7067-76047-0033,she would find that life was worth while to such people in a way that made the ordinary entertainments and amusements of her life a monstrous silly waste of time with the facility of her sex she would pick up from one of them the idea that made life worth while for him
1457,7067-76047-0034,harsh educational experience and very profound mental disturbance there have been love experiences experiences that were something more than the treats and attentions and proposals that made up her life when she was sheltered over there
1458,7067-76047-0035,and something more than that what it is i don't know the war has turned an ugly face to her she has seen death and suffering and ruin perhaps she has seen people she knew killed perhaps the man has been killed
1459,7067-76047-0036,or she has met with cowardice or cruelty or treachery where she didn't expect it she has been shocked out of the first confidence of youth she has ceased to take the world for granted it hasn't broken her but it has matured her
1460,7067-76047-0037,that i think is why history has become real to her which so attracts you in her history for her has ceased to be a fabric of picturesque incidents it is the study of a tragic struggle that still goes on
1461,7067-76047-0038,she sees history as you see it and i see it she is a very grown up young woman it's just that said sir richmond it's just that if you see as much in miss grammont as all that why don't you want to come on with us you see the interest of her
1462,7067-76047-0039,i see a lot more than that you don't know what an advantage it is to be as i am rather cold and unresponsive to women and unattractive and negligible negligible that is the exact word to them you can't look at a woman for five minutes
1463,7067-76047-0040,seems to imply necessarily a certain imaginative fixity miss grammont has an impulsive and adventurous character and as i have been saying she was a spoilt child with no discipline
1464,7067-76047-0041,you also are a person of high intelligence and defective controls she is very much at loose ends you on account of the illness of that rather forgotten lady miss martin leeds
1465,7067-76047-0042,you i say are also at loose ends can you deny it my dear sir don't we both know that ever since we left london you have been ready to fall in love with any pretty thing in petticoats that seemed to promise you three ha'porth of kindness
1466,7067-76047-0043,grotesquely happen he said she knows nothing of martin leeds you must remember that and then he added if she and you fall in love
1467,7067-76047-0044,as the phrase goes what is to follow there was a pause sir richmond looked at his toes for a moment or so as if he took counsel with them and then decided to take offence
1468,7067-76047-0045,really he said this is preposterous you talk of falling in love as though it was impossible for a man and woman to be deeply interested in each other without that and the gulf in our ages in our quality
1469,7067-76047-0046,from the psychologist of a new age i find this amazing are men and women to go on for ever separated by this possibility into two hardly communicating and yet interpenetrating worlds
1470,7067-76047-0047,is there never to be friendship and companionship between men and women without passion you ought to know even better than i do that there is not for such people as you two anyhow
1471,7067-76047-0048,and at present the world is not prepared to tolerate friendship and companionship with that accompaniment that is the core of this situation a pause fell between the two gentlemen
1472,7067-76047-0049,they had smoothed over the extreme harshness of their separation and there was very little more to be said well said sir richmond in conclusion i am very sorry indeed martineau
1473,7067-76048-0000,i leave you to it his round face betrayed little or no vestiges of his overnight irritation ought you to leave me to it smiled sir richmond i shall be interested to learn what happens but if you won't stay to see
1474,7067-76048-0001,now sir please said the guard respectfully but firmly and doctor martineau got in sir richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit what else could i do he asked aloud to nobody in particular
1475,7067-76048-0002,section two for the better part of forty hours sir richmond had either been talking to miss grammont or carrying on imaginary conversations with her in her absence
1476,7067-76048-0003,and she repeated no remembered comments and prophets of her contemporaries about herself she either concealed or she had lost any great interest in her own personality
1477,7067-76048-0004,but she was interested in and curious about the people she had met in life and her talk of them reflected a considerable amount of light upon her own upbringing and experiences and her liking for sir richmond was pleasingly manifest
1478,7067-76048-0005,she liked his turn of thought she watched him with a faint smile on her lips as he spoke and she spread her opinions before him carefully in that soft voice of hers like a shy child showing its treasures to some suddenly trusted and favoured visitor
1479,7067-76048-0006,as a crisis in which they were called upon to do something they did not yet clearly know what into this topic they peered as into some deep pool side by side and in it they saw each other reflected
1480,7067-76048-0007,its delight was particularly manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch both miss grammont and miss seyffert displayed an intelligent interest in their food after lunch they had all gone out to the stones and the wall
1481,7067-76048-0008,to a happy use by clambering to the top of it and sliding on their little behinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing
1482,7067-76048-0009,sir richmond and miss grammont had walked round the old circumvallation together but belinda seyffert had strayed away from them professing an interest in flowers
1483,7067-76048-0010,that it would be possible to take this confused old world and reshape it set it marching towards that new world of yours of two hundred and fifty million fully developed beautiful and happy people why not
1484,7067-76048-0011,nobody is doing anything with the world except muddle about why not give it a direction you'd take it in your hands like clay obdurate clay with a sort of recalcitrant unintelligent life of its own
1485,7067-76048-0012,her imagination glowed in her eyes and warmed her voice i believe what you say is possible if people dare i am tired of following little motives that are like flames that go out when you get to them
1486,7067-76048-0013,i am tired of seeing all the world doing the same i am tired of a world in which there is nothing great but great disasters here is something mankind can attempt that we can attempt and will i believe that as mankind grows up
1487,7067-76048-0014,and pride ourselves upon our freedom from the sin of presumption not quite that well how do you put it we are afraid she said it's too vast we want bright little lives of our own
1488,7067-76048-0015,sensible little piggy wiggys we have a right to life and happiness first said sir richmond as much right as a pig has to food but whether we get life and happiness or fail to get them we human beings
1489,7067-76048-0016,who have imaginations want something more nowadays of course we want bright lives of course we want happiness just as we want food just as we want sleep but when we have eaten when we have slept when we have jolly things about us it is nothing
1490,7067-76048-0017,we have been made an exception of and got our rations the big thing confronts us still
1491,7067-76048-0018,i do not know why it should be so but i am compelled by something in my nature to want to serve this idea of a new age for mankind i want it as my culminating want i want a world in order
1492,7067-76048-0019,a disciplined mankind going on to greater things don't you now you tell me of it she said with a smile i do but before no you've made it clear it wasn't clear before
1493,7067-76048-0020,i've been talking of this sort of thing with my friend doctor martineau and i've been thinking as well as talking that perhaps is why i'm so clear and positive i don't complain that you are clear and positive i've been coming along the same way
1494,7067-76048-0021,it's refreshing to meet you i found it refreshing to meet martineau a twinge of conscience about doctor martineau turned sir richmond into a new channel he's a most interesting man he said rather shy in some respects
1495,7067-76048-0022,devoted to his work and he's writing a book which has saturated him in these ideas only two nights ago we stood here and talked about it the psychology of a new age the world he believes is entering upon a new phase in its history
1496,7067-76048-0023,the adolescence so to speak of mankind it is an idea that seizes the imagination there is a flow of new ideas abroad he thinks widening realizations unprecedented hopes and fears
1497,7067-76048-0024,there is a consciousness of new powers and new responsibilities we are sharing the adolescence of our race it is giving history a new and more intimate meaning for us
1498,7067-76048-0025,making them matter as formerly they didn't seem to matter that idea of the bright little private life has to go by the board i suppose it has she said meditatively as though she had been thinking over some such question before
1499,7067-76048-0026,incidentally he smiled i want to get a lasso over the neck of that very forcible and barbaric person your father i am doing my best to help lay the foundation of a scientific world control of fuel production and distribution
1500,7067-76048-0027,but controlling father as distinguished from managing him she reviewed some private and amusing memories he is a most intractable man section three
1501,7067-76048-0028,they had gone on to talk of her father and of the types of men who controlled international business she had had plentiful opportunities for observation in their homes and her own
1502,7067-76048-0029,gunter lake the big banker she knew particularly well because it seemed she had been engaged or was engaged to marry him all these people she said are pushing things about affecting millions of lives
1503,7067-76048-0030,you will find my father extremely difficult but some of our younger men would love it and she went on there are american women who'd love it too we're petted we're kept out of things we aren't placed
1504,7067-76048-0031,we don't get enough to do we're spenders and wasters not always from choice while these fathers and brothers and husbands of ours play about with the fuel and power and life and hope of the world as though it was a game of poker
1505,7067-76048-0032,with all the empty unspeakable solemnity of the male and treat us as though we ought to be satisfied if they bring home part of the winnings that can't go on she said her eyes went back to the long low undulating skyline of the downs
1506,7067-76048-0033,she spoke as though she took up the thread of some controversy that had played a large part in her life that isn't going on she said with an effect of conclusive decision
1507,7067-76048-0034,sir richmond recalled that little speech now as he returned from salisbury station to the old george after his farewell to martineau he recalled too the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of her lifted chin
1508,7067-76048-0035,he felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being this young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments
1509,7067-76048-0036,in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality martineau was very fine minded in many respects but he was an old maid and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter
1510,7067-76048-0037,but passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common when they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest then it wasn't so necessary it might happen
1511,7067-76048-0038,her views about america and about her own place in the world seemed equally fresh and original to sir richmond i realize i've got to be a responsible american citizen she had said
1512,7067-76048-0039,that didn't mean that she attached very much importance to her recently acquired vote she evidently classified voters into the irresponsible who just had votes and the responsible who also had a considerable amount of property as well
1513,7067-76048-0040,she had no illusions about the power of the former class it didn't exist they were steered to their decisions by people employed directed or stimulated by father and his friends and associates the owners of america the real responsible citizens
1514,7067-76048-0041,or they fell a prey to the merely adventurous leading of revolutionaries but anyhow they were steered she herself it was clear was bound to become a very responsible citizen indeed
1515,7067-76048-0042,she would some day she laughed be swimming in oil and such like property her interest in sir richmond's schemes for a scientific world management of fuel was therefore she realized a very direct one but it was remarkable to find a young woman seeing it like that
1516,7067-76048-0043,father it seemed varied very much in his attitude towards her he despised and distrusted women generally and it was evident he had made it quite clear to her how grave an error it was on her part to persist in being a daughter and not a son
1517,7067-76048-0044,at moments it seemed to sir richmond that she was disposed to agree with father upon that when mister grammont's sense of her regrettable femininity was uppermost
1518,7067-76048-0045,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all
1519,7067-76048-0046,he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicability of his life's ideal there was hetty green this latter idea had reft her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe
1520,7067-76048-0047,after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and an office down town she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mister grammont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard
1521,7067-76048-0048,she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two menservants
1522,7067-76048-0049,this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into mexico there apparently she had really done responsible work but upon the question of labour mister grammont was fierce
1523,7067-76048-0050,he discovered his daughter displaying what he considered an improper familiarity with socialist ideas
1524,7067-76048-0051,and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way
1525,7067-76048-0052,mister lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment there was some story however connected with her war services in europe upon which miss grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell
1526,7067-76048-0053,still quite vaguely guessing so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as allusions or by way of illustration
1527,7067-76048-0054,the sustaining topic was this new age sir richmond fore shadowed this world under scientific control the utopia of fully developed people fully developing the resources of the earth
1528,7067-76048-0055,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to doctor martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that doctor martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him
1529,7067-76048-0056,but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with doctor martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings
1530,7067-76048-0057,and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise to morrow the new age will be here no doubt but today it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings so that it was natural for miss grammont and sir richmond to ask
1531,7067-76048-0058,what are we to do with such types as father and to fall into an idiom that assumed a joint enterprise they had agreed by a tacit consent to a common conception of the world they desired as a world scientifically ordered
1532,7067-76048-0059,an immense organization of mature commonsense healthy and secure gathering knowledge and power for creative adventures as yet beyond dreaming
1533,7067-76048-0060,and replaceable structures indeed both these two people found themselves thinking in this fashion with an unwonted courage and freedom because the other one had been disposed to think in this fashion before
1534,87-121553-0000,and in its gyre had not turned wholly round before another in a ring enclosed it and motion joined to motion song to song song that as greatly doth transcend our muses our sirens in those dulcet clarions as primal splendour that which is reflected
1535,87-121553-0001,when juno to her handmaid gives command the one without born of the one within like to the speaking of that vagrant one whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours
1536,87-121553-0002,after the dance and other grand rejoicings both of the singing and the flaming forth effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender together at once with one accord had stopped even as the eyes that as volition moves them must needs together shut and lift themselves
1537,87-121553-0003,out of the heart of one of the new lights there came a voice that needle to the star made me appear in turning thitherward and it began the love that makes me fair draws me to speak about the other leader by whom so well is spoken here of mine
1538,87-121553-0004,tis right where one is to bring in the other that as they were united in their warfare together likewise may their glory shine the soldiery of christ which it had cost so dear to arm again behind the standard moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few
1539,87-121553-0005,when the emperor who reigneth evermore provided for the host that was in peril through grace alone and not that it was worthy and as was said he to his bride brought succour with champions twain at whose deed at whose word the straggling people were together drawn
1540,87-121553-0006,within that region where the sweet west wind rises to open the new leaves wherewith europe is seen to clothe herself afresh not far off from the beating of the waves behind which in his long career the sun sometimes conceals himself from every man
1541,87-121553-0007,is situate the fortunate calahorra under protection of the mighty shield in which the lion subject is and sovereign therein was born the amorous paramour of christian faith the athlete consecrate kind to his own and cruel to his foes
1542,87-121553-0008,and when it was created was his mind replete with such a living energy that in his mother her it made prophetic as soon as the espousals were complete between him and the faith at holy font where they with mutual safety dowered each other
1543,87-121553-0009,the woman who for him had given assent saw in a dream the admirable fruit that issue would from him and from his heirs and that he might be construed as he was a spirit from this place went forth to name him with his possessive whose he wholly was
1544,87-121553-0010,dominic was he called and him i speak of even as of the husbandman whom christ elected to his garden to assist him envoy and servant sooth he seemed of christ for the first love made manifest in him was the first counsel that was given by christ
1545,87-121553-0011,silent and wakeful many a time was he discovered by his nurse upon the ground as if he would have said for this i came o thou his father felix verily o thou his mother verily joanna if this interpreted means as is said
1546,87-121553-0012,not for the world which people toil for now in following ostiense and taddeo but through his longing after the true manna he in short time became so great a teacher that he began to go about the vineyard which fadeth soon if faithless be the dresser
1547,87-121553-0013,not through itself but him who sits there and degenerates not to dispense or two or three for six not any fortune of first vacancy non decimas quae sunt pauperum dei
1548,87-121553-0014,he asked for but against the errant world permission to do battle for the seed of which these four and twenty plants surround thee then with the doctrine and the will together with office apostolical he moved like torrent which some lofty vein out presses
1549,87-121553-0015,and in among the shoots heretical his impetus with greater fury smote wherever the resistance was the greatest of him were made thereafter divers runnels whereby the garden catholic is watered so that more living its plantations stand
1550,87-121553-0016,in which the holy church itself defended and in the field its civic battle won truly full manifest should be to thee the excellence of the other unto whom thomas so courteous was before my coming
1551,87-121553-0017,but still the orbit which the highest part of its circumference made is derelict so that the mould is where was once the crust his family that had straight forward moved with feet upon his footprints are turned round so that they set the point upon the heel
1552,87-121553-0018,i am as i am wont twill not be from casal nor acquasparta from whence come such unto the written word that one avoids it and the other narrows
1553,87-121553-0019,who always in great offices postponed considerations sinister here are illuminato and agostino who of the first barefooted beggars were that with the cord the friends of god became hugh of saint victor is among them here
1554,87-121553-0020,and peter mangiador and peter of spain who down below in volumes twelve is shining nathan the seer and metropolitan chrysostom
1555,87-121553-0021,here is rabanus and beside me here shines the calabrian abbot joachim he with the spirit of prophecy endowed to celebrate so great a paladin have moved me the impassioned courtesy and the discreet discourses of friar thomas
1556,87-121553-0022,let him imagine who would well conceive what now i saw and let him while i speak retain the image as a steadfast rock the fifteen stars that in their divers regions the sky enliven with a light so great
1557,87-121553-0023,that in the point beginneth of the axis round about which the primal wheel revolves to have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven
1558,87-121553-0024,the moment when she felt the frost of death and one to have its rays within the other and both to whirl themselves in such a manner that one should forward go the other backward
1559,87-121553-0025,and he will have some shadowing forth of that true constellation and the double dance that circled round the point at which i was because it is as much beyond our wont as swifter than the motion of the chiana moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds
1560,87-121553-0026,then broke the silence of those saints concordant the light in which the admirable life of god's own mendicant was told to me and said
1561,87-121553-0027,that it weighs down the balance of all sin whate'er of light it has to human nature been lawful to possess was all infused by the same power that both of them created and hence at what i said above dost wonder
1562,87-121553-0028,when i narrated that no second had the good which in the fifth light is enclosed now ope thine eyes to what i answer thee and thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse fit in the truth as centre in a circle that which can die
1563,87-121553-0029,and that which dieth not are nothing but the splendour of the idea which by his love our lord brings into being because that living light which from its fount effulgent flows so that it disunites not from him nor from the love in them intrined
1564,87-121553-0030,itself eternally remaining one thence it descends to the last potencies downward from act to act becoming such that only brief contingencies it makes and these contingencies i hold to be things generated
1565,87-121553-0031,which the heaven produces by its own motion with seed and without neither their wax nor that which tempers it remains immutable and hence beneath the ideal signet more and less shines through therefore it happens that the selfsame tree
1566,87-121553-0032,after its kind bears worse and better fruit and ye are born with characters diverse if in perfection tempered were the wax and were the heaven in its supremest virtue the brilliance of the seal would all appear but nature gives it evermore deficient
1567,87-121553-0033,in the like manner working as the artist who has the skill of art and hand that trembles if then the fervent love the vision clear of primal virtue do dispose and seal perfection absolute is there acquired
1568,87-121553-0034,now if no farther forth i should proceed then in what way was he without a peer
1569,87-121553-0035,think who he was and what occasion moved him to make request when it was told him ask i've not so spoken that thou canst not see clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom that he might be sufficiently a king twas not to know the number in which are the motors here above
1570,87-121553-0036,or if in semicircle can be made triangle so that it have no right angle whence if thou notest this and what i said a regal prudence is that peerless seeing in which the shaft of my intention strikes and if on rose thou turnest thy clear eyes
1571,87-121553-0037,and the good are rare with this distinction take thou what i said and thus it can consist with thy belief of the first father and of our delight and lead shall this be always to thy feet to make thee like a weary man move slowly
1572,87-121553-0038,both to the yes and no thou seest not for very low among the fools is he who affirms without distinction or denies as well in one as in the other case because it happens that full often bends current opinion in the false direction
1573,87-121553-0039,and then the feelings bind the intellect far more than uselessly he leaves the shore since he returneth not the same he went who fishes for the truth and has no skill
1574,87-121553-0040,thus did sabellius arius and those fools who have been even as swords unto the scriptures in rendering distorted their straight faces nor yet shall people be too confident in judging even as he is who doth count the corn in field or ever it be ripe
1575,87-121553-0041,for i have seen all winter long the thorn first show itself intractable and fierce and after bear the rose upon its top and i have seen a ship direct and swift run o'er the sea throughout its course entire to perish at the harbour's mouth at last
1576,87-121553-0042,as from without tis struck or from within into my mind upon a sudden dropped what i am saying at the moment when silent became the glorious life of thomas because of the resemblance that was born of his discourse and that of beatrice whom after him it pleased thus to begin
1577,87-121553-0043,this man has need and does not tell you so nor with the voice nor even in his thought of going to the root of one truth more declare unto him if the light wherewith blossoms your substance shall remain with you eternally the same that it is now
1578,87-121553-0044,and if it do remain say in what manner after ye are again made visible it can be that it injure not your sight as by a greater gladness urged and drawn they who are dancing in a ring sometimes uplift their voices and their motions quicken
1579,87-121553-0045,so at that orison devout and prompt the holy circles a new joy displayed in their revolving and their wondrous song whoso lamenteth him that here we die that we may live above has never there seen the refreshment of the eternal rain
1580,87-121553-0046,the one and two and three who ever liveth and reigneth ever in three and two and one not circumscribed and all things circumscribing three several times was chanted by each one among those spirits with such melody that for all merit it were just reward
1581,87-121553-0047,its brightness is proportioned to the ardour the ardour to the vision and the vision equals what grace it has above its worth when glorious and sanctified our flesh is reassumed then shall our persons be more pleasing by their being all complete
1582,87-121553-0048,for will increase whate'er bestows on us of light gratuitous the good supreme light which enables us to look on him therefore the vision must perforce increase increase the ardour which from that is kindled increase the radiance which from this proceeds
1583,87-121553-0049,nor can so great a splendour weary us for strong will be the organs of the body to everything which hath the power to please us so sudden and alert appeared to me both one and the other choir to say amen that well they showed desire for their dead bodies
1584,87-121553-0050,nor sole for them perhaps but for the mothers the fathers and the rest who had been dear or ever they became eternal flames and lo all round about of equal brightness arose a lustre over what was there like an horizon that is clearing up
1585,87-121553-0051,so that the sight seems real and unreal it seemed to me that new subsistences began there to be seen and make a circle outside the other two circumferences o very sparkling of the holy spirit how sudden and incandescent it became unto mine eyes that vanquished bore it not
1586,87-121553-0052,but beatrice so beautiful and smiling appeared to me that with the other sights that followed not my memory i must leave her then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed the power and i beheld myself translated to higher salvation with my lady only
1587,87-121553-0053,well was i ware that i was more uplifted by the enkindled smiling of the star that seemed to me more ruddy than its wont with all my heart and in that dialect which is the same in all such holocaust to god i made as the new grace beseemed
1588,87-121553-0054,and not yet from my bosom was exhausted the ardour of sacrifice before i knew this offering was accepted and auspicious for with so great a lustre and so red splendours appeared to me in twofold rays i said o helios who dost so adorn them
1589,87-121553-0055,even as distinct with less and greater lights glimmers between the two poles of the world the galaxy that maketh wise men doubt thus constellated in the depths of mars those rays described the venerable sign that quadrants joining in a circle make
1590,87-121553-0056,here doth my memory overcome my genius for on that cross as levin gleamed forth christ so that i cannot find ensample worthy but he who takes his cross and follows christ again will pardon me what i omit seeing in that aurora lighten christ
1591,87-121553-0057,so from the lights that there to me appeared upgathered through the cross a melody which rapt me not distinguishing the hymn well was i ware it was of lofty laud because there came to me arise and conquer as unto him who hears and comprehends not
1592,87-121553-0058,so much enamoured i became therewith that until then there was not anything that e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold postponing the delight of those fair eyes into which gazing my desire has rest
1593,87-121553-0059,but who bethinks him that the living seals of every beauty grow in power ascending and that i there had not turned round to those can me excuse if i myself accuse to excuse myself and see that i speak truly for here the holy joy is not disclosed
1594,87-121553-0060,a will benign in which reveals itself ever the love that righteously inspires as in the iniquitous cupidity silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre and quieted the consecrated chords

1641,87-121553-0107,with all these families and others with them florence beheld i in so great repose that no occasion had she whence to weep
1642,5393-19219-0000,to realize one's dream to whom is this accorded there must be elections for this in heaven we are all candidates unknown to ourselves the angels vote cosette and marius had been elected cosette
1643,5393-19219-0001,a necklace of fine pearls a wreath of orange flowers all this was white and from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth it was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light
1644,5393-19219-0002,haughty with head held high amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of barras escorted cosette
1645,5393-19219-0003,could not give his hand to the bride
1646,5393-19219-0004,evil has no right to exist that there should be any unhappy men is in sooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky evil does not come from man who is good at bottom all human miseries have for their capital and central government hell
1647,5393-19219-0005,good here i am uttering demagogical words as far as i am concerned i have no longer any political opinions let all me be rich that is to say mirthful and i confine myself to that when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies
1648,5393-19219-0006,after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses
1649,5393-19219-0007,and all being finished cosette still could not believe that it was real she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream
1650,5393-19219-0008,marius beside cosette
1651,5393-19219-0009,and jean valjean sat opposite them aunt gillenormand had withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle my children said the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron
1652,5393-19219-0010,and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic whisper so it is true my name is marius i am madame thou these two creatures were resplendent
1653,5393-19219-0011,and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy they realized the verses of jean prouvaire they were forty years old taken together it was marriage sublimated
1654,5393-19219-0012,these two children were two lilies they did not see each other they did not contemplate each other cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory marius perceived cosette on an altar and on that altar
1655,5393-19219-0013,and in that glory the two apotheoses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the real thing the meeting of the kiss and the dream
1656,5393-19219-0014,the nuptial pillow all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless nights their tears their anguish their terrors
1657,5393-19219-0015,their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension it was the same enchantment in two souls
1658,5393-19219-0016,and with modesty in cosette they said to each other in low tones we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plumet the folds of cosette's gown lay across marius
1659,5393-19219-0017,one possesses and one supposes one still has time before one to divine the emotion on that day of being at mid day and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd
1660,5393-19219-0018,and inspired the passers by with cheerfulness
1661,5393-19219-0019,in front of saint paul to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange flowers quivering on cosette's head then they returned home
1662,5393-19219-0020,they beheld the light of a rising sun all at once the clock struck marius glanced at cosette's charming bare arm and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice and cosette
1663,5393-19219-0021,blushed to her very hair
1664,5393-19219-0022,they pressed about cosette each one vied with the rest in saluting her
1665,5393-19219-0023,to be present at the wedding of his cousin pontmercy cosette did not recognize him he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman

1667,5393-19219-0025,was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the candles around the chandelier
1668,5393-19219-0026,on the walls sconces with triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate porcelain faience pottery gold and silversmith's work all was sparkling and gay
1669,5393-19219-0027,jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing room behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him a few moments before they sat down to table cosette came
1670,5393-19219-0028,and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table two large arm chairs figured on the right and left of the bride the first for m gillenormand the other for jean valjean
1671,5393-19219-0029,the other arm chair remained empty they looked about for m fauchelevent he was no longer there m gillenormand questioned basque do you know where m fauchelevent is sir replied basque i do precisely
1672,5393-19219-0030,m fauchelevent told me to say to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was paining him somewhat and that he could not dine with monsieur le baron
1673,5393-19219-0031,that he would come to morrow he has just taken his departure that empty arm chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment but if m fauchelevent was absent
1674,5393-19219-0032,and the grandfather beamed for two he affirmed that m fauchelevent had done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a slight ailment this declaration sufficed moreover
1675,5393-19219-0033,what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy cosette and marius were passing through
1676,5393-19219-0034,from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself she set her sweet little foot
1677,5393-19219-0035,the arm chair being occupied m fauchelevent was obliterated and nothing was lacking and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness at dessert

1699,5393-19219-0057,there was a tumult then silence the married pair disappeared a little after midnight
1700,5393-19219-0058,here we pause on the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel with his finger on his lips the soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the celebration of love takes place there should be flashes of light athwart such houses
1701,5393-19219-0059,ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy and vaguely illuminate the gloom it is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to the infinite love is the sublime crucible
1702,5393-19219-0060,dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone were to listen they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling
1703,5393-19219-0061,when two mouths rendered sacred by love approach to create it is impossible that there should not be above that ineffable kiss a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars these felicities are the true ones
1704,5393-19219-0062,there is no joy outside of these joys love is the only ecstasy all the rest weeps to love or to have loved this suffices demand nothing more there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life
1705,5393-19218-0000,the night of the sixteenth to the seventeenth of february eighteen thirty three was a blessed night above its shadows heaven stood open it was the wedding night of marius and cosette the day had been adorable
1706,5393-19218-0001,it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pair a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling
1707,5393-19218-0002,the manner of marriage in eighteen thirty three was not the same as it is to day france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off one's wife of fleeing
1708,5393-19218-0003,on coming out of church of hiding oneself with shame from one's happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisiteness
1709,5393-19218-0004,the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell mell with the tete a tete of the conductor of the diligence and the maid servant of the inn in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living the mayor and his scarf the priest
1710,5393-19218-0005,oaths to the norman horses with their tails knotted up false galloons varnished hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility
1711,5393-19218-0006,and raining down on the post chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn out shoes in memory of churchill

1713,5393-19218-0008,marriage was not conducted at a full trot strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess
1714,5393-19218-0009,provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the household should thenceforth
1715,5393-19218-0010,natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church produce some complication they could not get ready before the sixteenth of february
1716,5393-19218-0011,now we note this detail for the pure satisfaction of being exact it chanced
1717,5393-19218-0012,as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property the papers had been simple
1718,5393-19218-0013,an accident happened to jean valjean he crushed the thumb of his right hand
1719,5393-19218-0014,nor even to see his hurt not even cosette nevertheless this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage and to carry his arm in a sling and had prevented his signing m gillenormand
1720,5393-19218-0015,in his capacity of cosette's supervising guardian had supplied his place we will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to the church one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent
1721,5393-19218-0016,to the church of saint paul at that epoch

1726,5393-19218-0021,any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle police sergeants maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current
1727,5393-19218-0022,those two brooks of carriages flowing the one down stream the other up stream
1728,5393-19218-0023,emblazoned with coats of arms held the middle of the way going and coming freely certain joyous and magnificent trains notably
1729,5393-19218-0024,had the same privilege in this gayety of paris england cracked her whip lord seymour's post chaise harassed by a nickname from the populace passed with great noise in the double file along which the municipal guards galloped like sheep dogs
1730,5393-19218-0025,honest family coaches loaded down with great aunts and grandmothers displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in disguise clowns of seven years of age columbines of six ravishing little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of the public mirth
1731,5393-19218-0026,one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line then they set out again on the march the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the bastille and skirting the right side of the boulevard
1732,5393-19218-0027,nearly at the same moment the other file which was proceeding towards the madeleine halted also at that point of the file there was a carriage load of maskers these carriages or to speak more correctly these wagon loads of maskers
1733,5393-19218-0028,are very familiar to parisians if they were missing on a shrove tuesday or at the mid lent it would be taken in bad part and people would say there's something behind that probably the ministry is about to undergo a change
1734,5393-19218-0029,tow wigs pink tights dandified hats spectacles of a grimacer
1735,5393-19218-0030,tormented with a butterfly shouts directed at pedestrians fists on hips bold attitudes bare shoulders immodesty unchained a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers

1742,5393-19218-0037,there is government therein there one lays one's finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and public women it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of gayety
1743,5393-19218-0038,that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be enticed that the system of spying and serving as caryatids to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them
1744,5393-19218-0039,that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags half dung half light roll by on four wheels howling and laughing that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames
1745,5393-19218-0040,the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace and populaces like tyrants require buffoons the king has roquelaure

1748,5393-19218-0043,that one of these shapeless clusters of masked men and women dragged about on a vast calash should halt on the left of the boulevard while the wedding train halted on the right the carriage load of masks
1749,5393-19218-0044,caught sight of the wedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the boulevard hullo said a masker here's a wedding a sham wedding retorted another we are the genuine article and being too far off to accost the wedding party
1750,5393-19218-0045,and fearing also the rebuke of the police the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere at the end of another minute the carriage load of maskers had their hands full the multitude set to yelling which is the crowd's caress to masquerades
1751,5393-19218-0046,and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace a frightful exchange of metaphors took place
1752,5393-19218-0047,in the meanwhile two other maskers in the same carriage a spaniard with an enormous nose an elderly air and huge black moustache and a gaunt fishwife who was quite a young girl
1753,5393-19218-0048,and while their companions and the passers by were exchanging insults they had held a dialogue in a low voice their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle which was wide open
1754,5393-19218-0049,the breezes of february are not warm as the fishwife clad in a low necked gown replied to the spaniard she shivered laughed and coughed here is their dialogue say now what daddy

1766,5393-19218-0061,who that old cove belongs to and where that wedding pair lives i like that that would be queer it's so easy to find out a wedding party that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday a week afterwards a pin in a hay mow
1767,1334-135589-0000,chapter twenty seven but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army
1768,1334-135589-0001,you have to choose between two generals both great in the art of war
1769,1334-135589-0002,and turenne i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon that will be the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players which would your majesty recommend me to follow inquired edward
1770,1334-135589-0003,and he will soon be opposed to this truculent and dishonest court who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes but who have never intended to keep their promises and place me on the english throne
1771,1334-135589-0004,i will give you letters to conde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong that is not your affair
1772,1334-135589-0005,conde is just now released from vincennes but depend upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of conde
1773,1334-135589-0006,you are here highly spoken of said the prince for so young a man so you were at the affair of worcester we will retain you for your services will be wanted by and by
1774,1334-135589-0007,can you procure any of your countrymen i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for any more
1775,1334-135589-0008,bring me the officers to morrow at this hour monsieur beverley au revoir
1776,1334-135589-0009,edward went to chaloner and grenville who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them the next day they were at the prince's levee and introduced by edward i am fortunate gentlemen
1777,1334-135589-0010,said the prince in securing the services of such fine young men you will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service and then follow me to guienne to which province i am now about to depart
1778,1334-135589-0011,and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required a month after this interview conde who had been joined by a great number of nobles
1779,1334-135589-0012,and had been re enforced by troops from spain set up the standard of revolt edward and his friends joined them with about three hundred english and scotchmen which they had enlisted and very soon afterward
1780,1334-135589-0013,conde obtained the victory at blenan and in april sixteen fifty two advanced to paris turenne who had taken the command of the french army followed him
1781,1334-135589-0014,and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of saint antoine in which neither party had the advantage
1782,1334-135589-0015,and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his departure from paris edward had received humphrey's letter explaining away the intendant's conduct
1783,1334-135589-0016,and the contents removed a heavy load from edward's mind but he now thought of nothing but war and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
1784,1334-135589-0017,he wrote a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
1785,1334-135589-0018,except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects it may be years before i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
1786,1334-135589-0019,and edward with his friends followed his fortunes and gained his good will they were rapidly promoted time flew on and in the year sixteen fifty four the court of france concluded an alliance with cromwell
1787,1334-135589-0020,and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands turenne bore down conde who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
1788,1334-135589-0021,made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
1789,1334-135589-0022,edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
1790,1334-135589-0023,after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
1791,1334-135589-0024,and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and every thing was ready for the restoration
1792,1334-135589-0025,on the fifteenth of may sixteen sixty the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king sailed from scheveling
1793,1334-135589-0026,was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london which he entered amid the acclamations of the people on the twenty ninth of the same month we may leave the reader to suppose that edward
1794,1334-135589-0027,were among the most favored of those in his train as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude the windows of all the houses were filled with well dressed ladies who waved their white kerchiefs to the king
1795,1334-135589-0028,and his attendant suit chaloner edward and grenville who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting were certainly the most distinguished among the king's retinue look edward
1796,1334-135589-0029,at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize them indeed i do not are they any of our paris beauties
1797,1334-135589-0030,they are thy sisters alice and edith
1798,1334-135589-0031,it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles i'm sure it is them yes replied grenville
1799,1334-135589-0032,will they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
1800,1334-135589-0033,for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
1801,1334-135589-0034,well chaloner to all appearance your good aunts have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
1802,1334-135589-0035,although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice that's edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
1803,1334-135589-0036,alice and edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
1804,1334-135589-0037,the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
1805,1334-135589-0038,and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conynghame and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
1806,1334-135589-0039,which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
1807,1334-135589-0040,now edward who do you think was here to day the reigning belle and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
1808,1334-135589-0041,no less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted edward patience heatherstone patience heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
1809,1334-135589-0042,i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
1810,1334-135589-0043,with her to day when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
1811,1334-135589-0044,and i understand is a very princely mansion humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mister heatherstone does it not replied edward
1812,1334-135589-0045,how can you say so edward you received humphrey's letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity
1813,1334-135589-0046,what is your perplexity well replied edward since it is to be so let us sit down and talk over the matter i acknowledge the kindness of mister heatherstone
1814,1334-135589-0047,and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
1815,1334-135589-0048,but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
1816,1334-135589-0049,although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot
1817,1334-135589-0050,you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you in two said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you can not blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone
1818,1334-135589-0051,is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property
1819,1334-135589-0052,he can not refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his council will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
1820,1334-135589-0053,which has been so long held by others
1821,1334-135589-0054,recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
1822,1334-135589-0055,and the king's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty
1823,1334-135589-0056,at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
1824,1334-135589-0057,why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
1825,1334-135589-0058,you were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey who has all along been acting as his factotum in the business and recollect at the time that mister heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion
1826,1334-135589-0059,what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstone's intentions than he has made known to us
1827,1334-135589-0060,and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstone's intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward
1828,1334-135589-0061,and now let me give you some advice for your friends masters chaloner and grenville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
1829,1334-135589-0062,those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
1830,1334-135589-0063,but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the king's intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
1831,1334-135589-0064,even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward
1832,1334-135589-0065,and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader
1833,1334-135589-0066,that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had dispatched a messenger with the letter
1834,1334-135589-0067,but the messenger had not yet returned
1835,1334-135589-0068,on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edward's sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
1836,1334-135589-0069,and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
1837,1334-135589-0070,mister heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
1838,1334-135589-0071,edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve
1839,1334-135589-0072,but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
1840,1334-135589-0073,there was the same pensive sweet expression in her face which had altered little but the beautiful rounded arms
1841,1334-135589-0074,and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance
1842,1334-135589-0075,and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
1843,1334-135589-0076,i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patience made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
1844,1334-135589-0077,and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was enabled to go to his sisters
1845,1334-135589-0078,when he entered the room he found himself in the arms of humphrey who had arrived with the messenger after the greetings were over edward said alice and i have seen patience and i fear i must surrender at discretion
1846,1334-135589-0079,mister heatherstone may make his own terms i must wave all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i have seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife
1847,1334-135589-0080,let her father but give me her and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are
1848,1334-135589-0081,they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone
1849,1334-135589-0082,has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property he has indeed replied edward as for his daughter edward you have yet to win her and wear her
1850,1334-135589-0083,as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you
1851,1334-135589-0084,but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away
1852,1334-135589-0085,it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
1853,1334-135589-0086,and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
1854,1334-135589-0087,and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
1855,1334-135589-0088,you know humphrey how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
1856,1334-135589-0089,to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argued upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
1857,1334-135589-0090,replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
1858,1334-135589-0091,after that speech sir the sooner you get back again the better retorted edith but edward made a sign to humphrey and they beat a retreat have you seen the intendant humphrey no
1859,1334-135589-0092,i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially
1860,1334-135589-0093,that will be explanation sufficient i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere
1861,1334-135589-0094,what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him your coming with me will make it appear so
1862,1334-135589-0095,tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and edith wrong as regards his daughter
1863,1334-135589-0096,nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed passed my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mister heatherstone edward
1864,1334-135589-0097,on mister heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentleman's conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
1865,1334-135589-0098,patience colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her
1866,1334-135589-0099,then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fete at hampton court given in honor of three marriages taking place edward beverley to patience heatherstone chaloner
1867,1334-135589-0100,to alice and grenville to edith and as his majesty himself said as he gave away the brides could loyalty be better rewarded but our young readers will not be content if they do not hear
1868,1334-135589-0101,some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history humphrey must take the first place his love of farming continued edward gave him a large farm rent free
1869,1334-135589-0102,and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself he then married clara ratcliffe who has not appeared lately on the scene owing to her having been about two years before the restoration
1870,1334-135589-0103,claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey
1871,1334-135589-0104,the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a houseful of young gipsies
1872,1334-135589-0105,oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age
1873,1334-135589-0106,in the capacity of housekeeper her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties
1874,5678-43303-0000,mabel remembered her husband's advice to watch and for a few days did her best but there was nothing that alarmed her the old lady was a little quiet perhaps but went about her minute affairs as usual she asked the girl to read to her sometimes
1875,5678-43303-0001,she packed his bag with her own hands set out his furs for the swift flight to paris and waved to him from the window as he went down the little path towards the junction he would be gone three days he said it was on the evening of the second day that she fell ill
1876,5678-43303-0002,and mabel running upstairs in alarm at the message of the servant found her rather flushed and agitated in her chair it is nothing my dear said the old lady tremulously and she added the description of a symptom or two
1877,5678-43303-0003,she was sincerely fond of the old lady and had always found her presence in the house a quiet sort of delight the effect of her upon the mind was as that of an easy chair upon the body the old lady was so tranquil and human
1878,5678-43303-0004,so absorbed in small external matters so reminiscent now and then of the days of her youth so utterly without resentment or peevishness
1879,5678-43303-0005,she found less difficulty in contemplating the end of a vigorous soul for in that case she imagined a kind of energetic rush of force back into the origin of things
1880,5678-43303-0006,her whole point so to speak lay in the delicate little fabric of personality built out of fragile things into an entity far more significant than the sum of its component parts the death of a flower reflected mabel is sadder than the death of a lion
1881,5678-43303-0007,the breaking of a piece of china more irreparable than the ruin of a palace it is syncope said the doctor when he came in she may die at any time she may live ten years there is no need to telegraph for mister brand
1882,5678-43303-0008,he made a little deprecating movement with his hands it is not certain that she will die it
1883,5678-43303-0009,she asked no no she may live ten years i said he added a word or two of advice as to the use of the oxygen injector and went away the old lady was lying quietly in bed when the girl went up and put out a wrinkled hand
1884,5678-43303-0010,well my dear she asked it is just a little weakness mother you must lie quiet and do nothing shall i read to you no my dear i will think a little it was no part of mabel's idea to duty to tell her that she was in danger
1885,5678-43303-0011,for there was no past to set straight no judge to be confronted death was an ending not a beginning it was a peaceful gospel at least it became peaceful as soon as the end had come
1886,5678-43303-0012,so the girl went downstairs once more with a quiet little ache at her heart that refused to be still what a strange and beautiful thing death was she told herself this resolution of a chord that had hung suspended for thirty fifty or seventy years
1887,5678-43303-0013,back again into the stillness of the huge instrument that was all in all to itself those same notes would be struck again were being struck again even now all over the world though with an infinite delicacy of difference in the touch
1888,5678-43303-0014,but that particular emotion was gone it was foolish to think that it was sounding eternally elsewhere for there was no elsewhere she too herself would cease one day let her see to it that the tone was pure and lovely
1889,5678-43303-0015,mister phillips arrived the next morning as usual just as mabel had left the old lady's room and asked news of her she is a little better i think said mabel she must be very quiet all day the secretary bowed and turned aside into oliver's room
1890,5678-43303-0016,where a heap of letters lay to be answered a couple of hours later as mabel went upstairs once more she met mister phillips coming down he looked a little flushed under his sallow skin missus brand sent for me he said she wished to know whether mister oliver would be back to night
1891,5678-43303-0017,he will will he not you have not heard mister brand said he would be here for a late dinner he will reach london at nineteen and is there any other news he compressed his lips there are rumours he said mister brand wired to me an hour ago
1892,5678-43303-0018,he seemed moved at something and mabel looked at him in astonishment it is not eastern news she asked his eyebrows wrinkled a little
1893,5678-43303-0019,she was not offended for she trusted her husband too well but she went on into the sick room with her heart beating the old lady too seemed excited she lay in bed with a clear flush in her white cheeks and hardly smiled at all to the girl's greeting
1894,5678-43303-0020,said mabel old missus brand looked at her sharply an instant but said nothing don't excite yourself mother oliver will be back to night the old lady drew a long breath don't trouble about me my dear she said i shall do very well now
1895,5678-43303-0021,he will be back to dinner will he not if the volor is not late now mother are you ready for breakfast mabel passed an afternoon of considerable agitation it was certain that something had happened
1896,5678-43303-0022,the secretary who breakfasted with her in the parlour looking on to the garden had appeared strangely excited he had told her that he would be away the rest of the day mister oliver had given him his instructions he had refrained from all discussion of the eastern question
1897,5678-43303-0023,and he had given her no news of the paris convention he only repeated that mister oliver would be back that night then he had gone of in a hurry half an hour later the old lady seemed asleep when the girl went up afterwards and mabel did not like to disturb her
1898,5678-43303-0024,neither did she like to leave the house so she walked by herself in the garden thinking and hoping and fearing till the long shadow lay across the path and the tumbled platform of roofs was bathed in a dusty green haze from the west
1899,5678-43303-0025,as she came in she took up the evening paper but there was no news there except to the effect that the convention would close that afternoon twenty o'clock came but there was no sign of oliver the paris volor should have arrived an hour before
1900,5678-43303-0026,but mabel staring out into the darkening heavens had seen the stars come out like jewels one by one
1901,5678-43303-0027,of course she might have missed it there was no depending on its exact course but she had seen it a hundred times before and wondered unreasonably why she had not seen it now but she would not sit down to dinner and paced up and down in her white dress
1902,5678-43303-0028,turning again and again to the window listening to the soft rush of the trains the faint hoots from the track and the musical chords from the junction a mile away the lights were up by now and the vast sweep of the towns looked like fairyland between the earthly light
1903,5678-43303-0029,and the heavenly darkness why did not oliver come or at least let her know why he did not once she went upstairs miserably anxious herself to reassure the old lady and found her again very drowsy he is not come she said
1904,5678-43303-0030,i dare say he may be kept in paris the old face on the pillow nodded and murmured and mabel went down again it was now an hour after dinner time oh there were a hundred things that might have kept him
1905,5678-43303-0031,he had often been later than this he might have missed the volor he meant to catch the convention might have been prolonged he might be exhausted and think it better to sleep in paris after all and have forgotten to wire
1906,5678-43303-0032,he might even have wired to mister phillips and the secretary have forgotten to pass on the message she went at last hopelessly to the telephone and looked at it there it was that round silent month that little row of labelled buttons
1907,5678-43303-0033,she half decided to touch them one by one and inquire whether anything had been heard of her husband there was his club his office in whitehall mister phillips's house parliament house and the rest but she hesitated telling herself to be patient
1908,5678-43303-0034,oliver hated interference and he would surely soon remember and relieve her anxiety then even as she turned away the bell rang sharply and a white label flashed into sight whitehall she pressed the corresponding button and her hand shaking so much
1909,5678-43303-0035,that she could scarcely hold the receiver to her ear she listened who is there her heart leaped at the sound of her husband's voice tiny and minute across the miles of wire i mabel she said alone here
1910,5678-43303-0036,i am back all is well now listen can you hear yes yes the best has happened it is all over in the east felsenburgh has done it now listen i cannot come home to night it will be announced in paul's house in two hours from now
1911,5678-43303-0037,we are communicating with the press come up here to me at once you must be present can you hear oh yes come then at once it will be the greatest thing in history tell no one come before the rush begins in half an hour the way will be stopped oliver
1912,5678-43303-0038,yes quick mother is ill shall i leave her how ill oh no immediate danger the doctor has seen her there was silence for a moment yes come then we will go back to night anyhow then
1913,5678-43301-0000,in his masonic insignia it was he who had given immense impetus to that secret movement by his declaration in the house that the key of future progress and brotherhood of nations was in the hands of the order
1914,5678-43301-0001,it was through this alone that the false unity of the church with its fantastic spiritual fraternity could be counteracted saint paul had been right he declared in his desire to break down the partition walls between nations
1915,5678-43301-0002,and wrong only in his exaltation of jesus christ thus he had preluded his speech on the poor law question pointing to the true charity that existed among masons apart from religious motive
1916,5678-43301-0003,and looked out with considerable excitement at the huge throng gathered to hear her son speak a platform was erected round the bronze statue at such a height that the statesman appeared to be one of the speakers though at a slightly higher elevation
1917,5678-43301-0004,and this platform was hung with roses surmounted by a sounding board and set with a chair and table the whole square round about was paved with heads and resonant with sound the murmurs of thousands of voices
1918,5678-43301-0005,overpowered now and again by the crash of brass and thunder of drums as the benefit societies and democratic guilds each headed by a banner
1919,5678-43301-0006,and converged towards the wide railed space about the platform where room was reserved for them the windows on every side were packed with faces tall stands were erected along the front of the national gallery and saint martin's church
1920,5678-43301-0007,garden beds of colour behind the mute white statues that faced outwards round the square from braithwaite in front past the victorians john davidson john burns and the rest round to hampden and de montfort towards the north
1921,5678-43301-0008,the old column was gone with its lions
1922,5678-43301-0009,nor the lions to the new art and in their place stretched a wide pavement broken by slopes of steps that led up to the national gallery overhead the roofs showed crowded friezes of heads against the blue summer sky
1923,5678-43301-0010,not less than one hundred thousand persons it was estimated in the evening papers were collected within sight and sound of the platform by noon as the clocks began to tell the hour two figures appeared from behind the statue and came forward and in an instant
1924,5678-43301-0011,the murmurs of talk rose into cheering old lord pemberton came first a grey haired upright man whose father had been active in denouncing the house of which he was a member on the occasion of its fall over seventy years ago and his son had succeeded him worthily
1925,5678-43301-0012,and it was he who was to be chairman on this auspicious occasion behind him came oliver bareheaded and spruce and even at that distance his mother and wife could see his brisk movement
1926,5678-43301-0013,there was no doubt that these londoners could sing it was as if a giant voice hummed the sonorous melody rising to enthusiasm till the music of massed bands followed it as a flag follows a flag stick the hymn was one composed ten years before
1927,5678-43301-0014,and all england was familiar with it old missus bland lifted the printed paper mechanically to her eyes and saw the words that she knew so well the lord that dwells in earth and sea
1928,5678-43301-0015,had been composed with both skill and ardour they had a religious ring the unintelligent christian could sing them without a qualm yet their sense was plain enough the old human creed that man was all even christ's words themselves were quoted
1929,5678-43301-0016,the kingdom of god it was said lay within the human heart and the greatest of all graces was charity she glanced at mabel and saw that the girl was singing with all her might with her eyes fixed on her husband's dark figure a hundred yards away
1930,5678-43301-0017,and his thin metallic voice piped a sentence or two across the tinkling splash of the fountains behind him then he stepped back and oliver came forward it was too far for the two to hear what was said but mabel slipped a paper smiling tremulously
1931,5678-43301-0018,into the old lady's hand and herself bent forward to listen old missus brand looked at that too knowing that it was an analysis of her son's speech and aware that she would not be able to hear his words
1932,5678-43301-0019,of this great anniversary then there came a retrospect comparing the old state of england with the present fifty years ago the speaker said poverty was still a disgrace now it was so no longer
1933,5678-43301-0020,it was in the causes that led to poverty that the disgrace or the merit lay who would not honour a man worn out in the service of his country or overcome at last by circumstances against which his efforts could not prevail
1934,5678-43301-0021,he enumerated the reforms passed fifty years before on this very day by which the nation once and for all declared the glory of poverty and man's sympathy with the unfortunate so he had told them he was to sing the praise of patient poverty
1935,5678-43301-0022,and its reward and that he supposed together with a few periods on the reform of the prison laws would form the first half of his speech the second part was to be a panegyric of braithwaite treating him as the precursor of a movement that even now had begun
1936,5678-43301-0023,old missus brand leaned back in her seat and looked about her the window where they sat had been reserved for them two arm chairs filled the space but immediately behind there were others standing very silent now craning forward watching too with parted lips
1937,5678-43301-0024,a couple of women with an old man directly behind and other faces visible again behind them their obvious absorption made the old lady a little ashamed of her distraction and she turned resolutely once more to the square ah he was working up now to his panegyric
1938,5678-43301-0025,the tiny dark figure was back a yard nearer the statue and as she looked his hand went up and he wheeled pointing as a murmur of applause drowned for an instant the minute resonant voice then again he was forward half crouching for he was a born actor
1939,5678-43301-0026,and a storm of laughter rippled round the throng of heads she heard an indrawn hiss behind her chair and the next instant an exclamation from mabel what was that there was a sharp crack and the tiny gesticulating figure staggered back a step
1940,5678-43301-0027,the old man at the table was up in a moment and simultaneously a violent commotion bubbled and heaved like water about a rock at a point in the crowd immediately outside the railed space where the bands were massed and directly opposite the front of the platform
1941,5678-43302-0000,oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at home leaning back in his chair with one arm bandaged and in a sling they had not been able to get near him at the time the excitement in the square had been too fierce
1942,5678-43302-0001,but a messenger had come to his wife with the news that her husband was only slightly wounded and was in the hands of the doctors he was a catholic explained the drawn faced oliver he must have come ready for his repeater was found loaded
1943,5678-43302-0002,well there was no chance for a priest this time mabel nodded slowly she had read of the man's fate on the placards he was killed trampled and strangled instantly said oliver i did what i could you saw me
1944,5678-43302-0003,but well i dare say it was more merciful but you did what you could my dear said the old lady anxiously from her corner i called out to them mother but they wouldn't hear me
1945,5678-43302-0004,mabel leaned forward oliver i know this sounds stupid of me but but i wish they had not killed him oliver smiled at her he knew this tender trait in her it would have been more perfect if they had not
1946,5678-43302-0005,she said then she broke off and sat back why did he shoot just then she asked oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother but she was knitting tranquilly then he answered with a curious deliberateness
1947,5678-43302-0006,i said that braithwaite had done more for the world by one speech than jesus and all his saints put together he was aware that the knitting needles stopped for a second then they went on again as before
1948,5678-43302-0007,but he must have meant to do it anyhow continued oliver how do they know he was a catholic asked the girl again there was a rosary on him and then he just had time to call on his god and nothing more is known
1949,5678-43302-0008,nothing more he was well dressed though oliver leaned back a little wearily and closed his eyes his arm still throbbed intolerably but he was very happy at heart it was true that he had been wounded by a fanatic
1950,5678-43302-0009,but he was not sorry to bear pain in such a cause and it was obvious that the sympathy of england was with him mister phillips even now was busy in the next room answering the telegrams that poured in every moment
1951,5678-43302-0010,caldecott the prime minister maxwell snowford and a dozen others had wired instantly their congratulations and from every part of england streamed in message after message it was an immense stroke for the communists
1952,5678-43302-0011,speaking in defence of his principles it was an incalculable gain for them and loss for the individualists that confessors were not all on one side after all
1953,5678-43302-0012,the huge electric placards over london had winked out the facts in esperanto as oliver stepped into the train at twilight oliver brand wounded catholic assailant indignation of the country
1954,5678-43302-0013,well deserved fate of assassin he was pleased too that he honestly had done his best to save the man even in that moment of sudden and acute pain he had cried out for a fair trial but he had been too late
1955,5678-43302-0014,he had seen the starting eyes roll up in the crimson face and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had clutched and torn at his throat then the face had vanished and a heavy trampling began where it had disappeared oh
1956,5678-43302-0015,there was some passion and loyalty left in england his mother got up presently and went out still without a word and mabel turned to him laying a hand on his knee are you too tired to talk my dear he opened his eyes
1957,5678-43302-0016,of course not my darling what is it what do you think will be the effect he raised himself a little looking out as usual through the darkening windows on to that astonishing view
1958,5678-43302-0017,everywhere now lights were glowing a sea of mellow moons just above the houses and above the mysterious heavy blue of a summer evening the effect he said it can be nothing but good it was time that something happened
1959,5678-43302-0018,my dear i feel very downcast sometimes as you know well i do not think i shall be again i have been afraid sometimes that we were losing all our spirit and that the old tories were partly right when they prophesied what communism would do
1960,5678-43302-0019,but after this well well we have shown that we can shed our blood too it is in the nick of time too just at the crisis i don't want to exaggerate it is only a scratch but it was so deliberate and
1961,5678-43302-0020,and so dramatic the poor devil could not have chosen a worse moment people won't forget it mabel's eyes shone with pleasure you poor dear she said are you in pain not much besides christ
1962,5678-43302-0021,if only this infernal eastern affair would end he knew he was feverish and irritable and made a great effort to drive it down oh my dear he went on flushed a little
1963,5678-43302-0022,if they would not be such heavy fools they don't understand they don't understand yes oliver they don't understand what a glorious thing it all is humanity life truth at last and the death of folly but haven't i told them a hundred times
1964,5678-43302-0023,she loved to see him like this his confident flushed face the enthusiasm in his blue eyes and the knowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with passion she bent forward and kissed him suddenly my dear i am so proud of you oh oliver he said nothing
1965,5678-43302-0024,but she could see what she loved to see that response to her own heart and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet more and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the world was alive and that they had a share in its affairs
1966,5678-43302-0025,oliver stirred presently did you notice anything just now sweetheart when i said that about jesus christ she stopped knitting for a moment said the girl he nodded you saw that too then
1967,5678-43302-0026,mabel do you think she is falling back oh she is getting old said the girl lightly of course she looks back a little but you don't think it would be too awful she shook her head no
1968,5678-43302-0027,no my dear you're excited and tired it's just a little sentiment oliver i don't think i would say that kind of thing before her but she hears it everywhere now no she doesn't remember
1969,5678-43302-0028,she can't get it out of her head even after fifty years well watch her won't you by the way yes there's a little more news from the east they say felsenburgh's running the whole thing now the empire is sending him everywhere
1970,5678-43302-0029,tobolsk benares yakutsk everywhere and he's been to australia mabel sat up briskly isn't that very hopeful i suppose so there's no doubt that the sufis are winning but for how long is another question
1971,5678-43302-0030,besides the troops don't disperse and europe europe is arming as fast as possible i hear we are to meet the powers next week at paris i must go your arm my dear my arm must get well it will have to go with me anyhow
1972,5678-43302-0031,tell me some more there is no more but it is just as certain as it can be that this is the crisis if the east can be persuaded to hold its hand now it will never be likely to raise it again it will mean free trade all over the world i suppose
1973,5678-43302-0032,and all that kind of thing but if not well if not there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even imagined
1974,5678-43302-0033,these new benninschein explosives will make certain of that but is it absolutely certain that the east has got them absolutely benninschein sold them simultaneously to east and west then he died luckily for him mabel had heard this kind of talk before
1975,5678-43302-0034,but her imagination simply refused to grasp it a duel of east and west under these new conditions was an unthinkable thing there had been no european war within living memory and the eastern wars of the last century had been under the old conditions
1976,5678-43302-0035,now if tales were true entire towns would be destroyed with a single shell the new conditions were unimaginable military experts prophesied extravagantly contradicting one another on vital points
1977,5678-43302-0036,the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory there were no precedents with which to compare it it was as if archers disputed as to the results of cordite only one thing was certain that the east had every modern engine and as regards male population
1978,5678-43302-0037,half as much again as the rest of the world put together and the conclusion to be drawn from these premisses was not reassuring to england but imagination simply refused to speak the daily papers had a short careful leading article every day
1979,5678-43302-0038,founded upon the scraps of news that stole out from the conferences on the other side of the world felsenburgh's name appeared more frequently than ever otherwise there seemed to be a kind of hush nothing suffered very much trade went on
1980,5678-43302-0039,european stocks were not appreciably lower than usual men still built houses married wives begat sons and daughters did their business and went to the theatre for the mere reason that there was no good in anything else they could neither save nor precipitate the situation
1981,5678-43302-0040,it was on too large a scale occasionally people went mad people who had succeeded in goading their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of reality could be obtained and there was a diffused atmosphere of tenseness but that was all
1982,8975-270782-0000,thirteenth lecture the dream archaic remnants and infantilism in the dream let us revert to our conclusion that the dream work under the influence of the dream censorship
1983,8975-270782-0001,transforms the latent dream thoughts into some other form of expression the latent thoughts are no other than the conscious thoughts known to us in our waking hours the new mode of expression is incomprehensible to us because of its many sided features
1984,8975-270782-0002,so we called the mode of expression of the dream work the archaic or regressive you may conclude that as a result of the deeper study of the dream work we gain valuable information about the rather unknown beginnings of our intellectual development i trust this will be true
1985,8975-270782-0003,but this work has not up to the present time been undertaken the antiquity into which the dream work carries us back is of a double aspect firstly the individual antiquity childhood and secondly in so far as every individual in his childhood
1986,8975-270782-0004,that we shall be able to differentiate which part of the latent psychic proceeding has its source in the individual
1987,8975-270782-0005,in this connection it appears to me for example that the symbolic relations which the individual has never learned
1988,8975-270782-0006,however this is not the only archaic characteristic of the dream you probably all know from your own experiences the peculiar amnesia that is loss of memory concerning childhood i mean the fact that the first years to the fifth
1989,8975-270782-0007,that of a gap in the memory is far more frequent i believe we have not laid enough stress on this fact the child is able to speak well at the age of two it soon shows that it can become adjusted to the most complicated psychic situations
1990,8975-270782-0008,and makes remarks which years later are retold to it but which it has itself entirely forgotten besides the memory in the early years is more facile because it is less burdened than in later years
1991,8975-270782-0009,nor is there any reason for considering the memory function as a particularly high or difficult psychic performance in fact the contrary is true and you can find a good memory in persons who stand very low intellectually
1992,8975-270782-0010,i must point out that certain well preserved memories for the most part formatively experienced stand forth in this memory void which surrounds the first years of childhood and do not justify this hypothesis
1993,8975-270782-0011,our memory deals selectively with its later materials with impressions which come to us in later life it retains the important and discards the unimportant this is not true of the retained childhood memories
1994,8975-270782-0012,they do not bespeak necessarily important experiences of childhood not even such as from the viewpoint of the child need appear of importance they are often so banal and intrinsically so meaningless that we ask ourselves in wonder why just these details
1995,8975-270782-0013,have escaped being forgotten i once endeavored to approach the riddle of childhood amnesia and the interrupted memory remnants with the help of analysis and i arrived at the conclusion that in the case of the child too
1996,8975-270782-0014,by means of careful analysis one is able to develop out of them everything that is forgotten
1997,8975-270782-0015,and in so far as the cure is to any degree successful we are able again to bring to light the content of the childhood years thus clouded in forgetfulness these impressions have never really been forgotten they have only been inaccessible latent
1998,8975-270782-0016,have belonged to the unconscious but sometimes they bob up out of the unconscious spontaneously and as a matter of fact this is what happens in dreams it is apparent that the dream life knows how to find the entrance to these latent
1999,8975-270782-0017,beautiful examples of this occur in literature and i myself can present such an example i once dreamed in a certain connection of a person who must have performed some service for me and whom i clearly saw he was a one eyed man short in stature stout
2000,8975-270782-0018,his head deeply sunk into his neck i concluded from the content that he was a physician luckily i was able to ask my mother who was still living how the physician in my birth place which i left when i was three years old looked
2001,8975-270782-0019,and i learned from her that he had one eye was short and stout with his head sunk into his neck and also learned at what forgotten mishap he had been of service to me this control over the forgotten material of childhood years
2002,8975-270782-0020,is then a further archaic tendency of the dream the same information may be made use of in another of the puzzles that have presented themselves to us you will recall how astonished people were
2003,8975-270782-0021,when we came to the conclusion that the stimuli which gave rise to dreams were extremely bad and licentious sexual desires which have made dream censorship and dream distortion necessary after we have interpreted such a dream for the dreamer and he
2004,8975-270782-0022,in the most favorable circumstances does not attack the interpretation itself he almost always asks the question whence such a wish comes
2005,8975-270782-0023,we need not hesitate to point out this origin these evil wish impulses have their origin in the past often in a past which is not too far away
2006,8975-270782-0024,the woman whose dream is interpreted to mean that she would like to see her seventeen year old daughter dead discovers under our guidance that she in fact at one time entertained this wish
2007,8975-270782-0025,which early ended in a separation
2008,8975-270782-0026,she beat her body with her fists in a fit of anger in order to kill the child how many mothers who to day love their children tenderly perhaps too tenderly received them unwillingly and at the time wished that the life within them would not develop further
2009,8975-270782-0027,indeed translated this wish into various actions happily harmless the later death wish against some loved one which seems so strange also has its origin in early phases of the relationship to that person
2010,8975-270782-0028,this wish was no stranger to him while the child was still a suckling this man who was unhappy in his choice of a wife often thought that if the little being that meant nothing to him would die he would again be free and would make better use of his freedom
2011,8975-270782-0029,that such wishes and such dreams cannot occur
2012,8975-270782-0030,only wish to warn you that you are to take into consideration not the exact terms of the dream but the meaning thereof according to its interpretation it may happen that the manifest dream of the death of some loved person has only made use of some frightful mask
2013,8975-270782-0031,that it really means something entirely different or that the loved person serves as a concealing substitute for some other but the same circumstances will call forth another more difficult question you say granted this death wish was present at some time or other
2014,8975-270782-0032,and is substantiated by memory yet this is no explanation it is long outlived to day it can be present only in the unconscious and as an empty emotionless memory but not as a strong impulse why should it be recalled by the dream at all this question is justified
2015,8975-270782-0033,in one of the most important points of dream study but i must remain within the bounds of our discussion and practice restraint prepare yourselves for the temporary abstention let us be satisfied with the circumstantial proof
2016,8975-270782-0034,that this outlived wish can be shown to act as a dream stimulator and let us continue the investigation to see whether or not other evil wishes admit of the same derivation out of the past let us continue with the removal or death wish
2017,8975-270782-0035,which most frequently can be traced back to the unbounded egoism of the dreamer
2018,8975-270782-0036,as often as someone has been in our way in life and how often must this happen in the complicated relationships of life the dream is ready to do away with him be he father mother brother sister spouse et cetera
2019,8975-270782-0037,we have wondered sufficiently over this evil tendency of human nature and certainly were not predisposed to accept the authenticity of this result of dream interpretation without question after it has once been suggested to us to seek the origin of such wishes in the past
2020,8975-270782-0038,or real remnants thereof show themselves for the child loves itself first and later learns to love others to sacrifice something of its ego for another
2021,8975-270782-0039,even those persons whom the child seems to love from the very beginning it loves at the outset because it has need of them cannot do without them in others words out of egoistical motives
2022,8975-270782-0040,not until later does the love impulse become independent of egoism in brief egoism has taught the child to love in this connection it is instructive to compare the child's regard
2023,8975-270782-0041,for his brothers and sisters with that which he has for his parents
2024,8975-270782-0042,often enough this attitude is superseded by a more tender feeling or rather let us say glossed over but the hostile feeling appears regularly to have been the earlier it is most noticeable in children of from two and one half
2025,8975-270782-0043,to four or five years of age when a new little brother or sister arrives the latter is usually received in a far from friendly manner expressions such as i don't want him let the stork take him away again are very usual
2026,8975-270782-0044,subsequently every opportunity is made use of to disparage the new arrival and even attempts to do him bodily harm direct attacks are not unheard of
2027,8975-270782-0045,if the difference in age is less the child learns of the existence of the rival with intense psychic activity and accommodates himself to the new situation if the difference in age is greater the new child may awaken certain sympathies as an
2028,8975-270782-0046,interesting object as a sort of living doll and if the difference is eight years or more motherly impulses especially in the case of girls may come into play but to be truthful when we disclose in a dream the wish for the death of a mother or sister
2029,8975-270782-0047,we need seldom find it puzzling and may trace its origin easily to early childhood often enough also to the propinquity of later years probably no nurseries are free from mighty conflicts among the inhabitants
2030,8975-270782-0048,the motives are rivalry for the love of the parents articles owned in common the room itself the hostile impulses are called forth by older as well as younger brothers and sisters
2031,8975-270782-0049,if there is anyone who hates a young english lady more than does her mother it is her elder sister there is something about this saying however that arouses our antipathy we can at a pinch understand hatred of brothers and sisters
2032,8975-270782-0050,and rivalry among them but how may feelings of hatred force their way into the relationship between daughter and mother parents and children this relationship is without doubt the more favorable even when looked at from the viewpoint of the child
2033,8975-270782-0051,this is in accord with our expectation we find it much more offensive for love between parents and children to be lacking than for love between brothers and sisters we have so to speak made something holy in the first instance
2034,8975-270782-0052,which in the other case we permitted to remain profane
2035,8975-270782-0053,the feelings between parents and their grown children fail to come up to the ideal established by society how much enmity exists and would find expression did not accumulations of piety and of tender impulse hold them back the motives for this are everywhere known
2036,8975-270782-0054,and disclose a tendency to separate those of the same sex daughter from mother father from son the daughter finds in her mother the authority that hems in her will and that is entrusted with the task of causing her to carry out
2037,8975-270782-0055,the abstention from sexual liberty which society demands in certain cases also she is the rival who objects to being displaced the same type of thing occurs in a more glaring manner between father and son
2038,8975-270782-0056,to the son the father is the embodiment of every social restriction borne with such great opposition the father bars the way to freedom of will to early sexual satisfaction
2039,8975-270782-0057,to the enjoyment thereof impatient waiting for the death of the father grows to heights approximating tragedy in the case of a successor to the throne less strained is the relationship between father and daughter mother and son
2040,8975-270782-0058,the latter affords the purest examples of an unalterable tenderness in no way disturbed by egoistical considerations why do i speak of these things so banal and so well known
2041,8975-270782-0059,because there is an unmistakable disposition to deny their significance in life and to set forth the ideal demanded by society as a fulfilled thing much oftener than it really is fulfilled but it is preferable for psychology to speak the truth
2042,8975-270782-0060,rather than that this task should be left to the cynic in any event this denial refers only to actual life the arts of narrative and dramatic poetry are still free to make use of the motives that result from a disturbance of this ideal
2043,8975-270782-0061,it is not to be wondered at that in the case of a large number of people the dream discloses the wish for the removal of the parents especially the parent of the same sex we may conclude that it is also present during waking hours
2044,8975-270782-0062,as in the case of the dreamer's sympathy for his father's unnecessary sufferings in example three it is seldom that the enmity alone controls the relationship much more often it recedes behind more tender impulses
2045,8975-270782-0063,by which it is suppressed and must wait until a dream isolates it that which the dream shows us in enlarged form as a result of such isolation shrinks together again after it has been properly docketed in its relation to life as a result of our interpretation
2046,8975-270782-0064,h sachs but we also find this dream wish in places where it has no connection with life and where the adult in his waking hours would never recognize it the reason for this is that the deepest and most uniform motive for becoming unfriendly
2047,8975-270782-0065,especially between persons of the same sex has already made its influence felt in earliest childhood i mean the love rivalry with the especial emphasis of the sex character the son even as a small child
2048,8975-270782-0066,who is a disturbing element in her tender relationship with her father and who occupies a position that she could very well fill herself one learns from these observations to what early years these ideas extend back
2049,8975-270782-0067,ideas which we designate as the oedipus complex because this myth realizes with a very slightly weakened effect the two extreme wishes which grow out of the situation of the son to kill his father and take his mother to wife
2050,8975-270782-0068,i do not wish to maintain that the oedipus complex covers entirely the relation of the child to its parents this relation can be much more complicated furthermore the oedipus complex is more or less well developed it may even experience a reversal
2051,8975-270782-0069,but it is a customary and very important factor in the psychic life of the child and one tends rather to underestimate than to overestimate its influence and the developments which may follow from it in addition
2052,8975-270782-0070,children frequently react to the oedipus idea through stimulation by the parents who in the placing of their affection are often led by sex differences so that the father prefers the daughter the mother the son
2053,8975-270782-0071,and this love is substituted for the outworn love one cannot maintain that the world was very grateful to psychoanalytic research for its discovery of the oedipus complex on the contrary it called forth the strongest resistance on the part of adults
2054,8975-270782-0072,and persons who had neglected to take part in denying this proscribed or tabooed feeling relationship later made good the omission by taking all value from the complex through false interpretations according to my unchanged conviction
2055,8975-270782-0073,cast out of life was yielded up to poetry and given the freest play o rank has shown in a careful study how this very oedipus complex has supplied dramatic literature
2056,8975-270782-0074,with a large number of motives in unending variations derivations and disguises also in distorted forms such as we recognize to be the work of a censor we may also ascribe this oedipus complex to those dreamers
2057,8975-270782-0075,who were so fortunate as to escape in later life these conflicts with their parents and intimately associated therewith we find what we call the castration complex the reaction to sexual intimidation or restriction ascribed to the father
2058,8975-270782-0076,by applying our former researches to the study of the psychic life of the child we may expect to find that the origin of other forbidden dream wishes of excessive sexual impulses may be explained in the same manner
2059,8975-270782-0077,thus we are moved to study the development of sex life in the child also and we discover the following from a number of sources in the first place it is a mistake to deny that the child has a sexual life and to take it for granted
2060,8975-270782-0078,that sexuality commences with the ripening of the genitals at the time of puberty on the contrary the child has from the very beginning a sexual life rich in content and differing in numerous respects
2061,8975-270782-0079,what we call perverse in the life of the adult differs from the normal in the following respects first in disregard for the dividing line of species the gulf between man and animal second
2062,8975-270782-0080,being insensible to the conventional feeling of disgust third the incest limitation being prohibited from seeking sexual satisfaction with near blood relations fourth homosexuality and fifth
2063,8975-270782-0081,he knows no unbridgable chasm between man and animal the arrogance with which man distinguishes himself from the animal is a later acquisition in the beginning he is not disgusted at the sight of excrement but slowly learns to be so disgusted
2064,8975-270782-0082,under the pressure of education he lays no special stress on the difference between the sexes rather accredits to both the same genital formation
2065,8975-270782-0083,toward those persons closest to him and who are dear to him for various reasons his parents brothers and sisters nurses and finally you may observe in him that which later breaks through again raised now to a love attraction
2066,8975-270782-0084,polymorphus perverse and if he makes but slight use of all these impulses it is on the one hand because of their lesser intensity as compared to later life and on the other hand
2067,8975-270782-0085,and to disguise another part by misrepresenting its sexual nature until they can deny the whole business these are often the same persons who discourse violently against all the sexual faults of the child
2068,8975-270782-0086,and then at the writing table defend the sexual purity of the same children where children are left to themselves or are under the influence of corruption
2069,8975-270782-0087,of perverse sexual activity to be sure the grown ups are right in looking upon these things as childish performances as play for the child is not to be judged as mature and answerable either before the bar of custom or before the law
2070,8975-270782-0088,but these things do exist they have their significance as indications of innate characteristics as well as causes and furtherances of later developments they give us an insight into childhood sex life and thereby into the sex life of man
2071,8975-270782-0089,when we rediscover in the background of our distorted dreams all these perverse wish impulses it means only that the dream has in this field
2072,8975-270782-0090,those directed towards sexual intercourse with parents and brothers and sisters you know what antipathy society feels toward such intercourse or at least pretends to feel and what weight is laid on the prohibitions directed against it
2073,8975-270782-0091,the most monstrous efforts have been made to explain this fear of incest some have believed that it is due to evolutionary foresight on the part of nature which is psychically represented by this prohibition because inbreeding would deteriorate the race character
2074,8975-270782-0092,others maintained that because of having lived together since early childhood the sexual desire is diverted from the persons under consideration in both cases furthermore the incest avoidance would be automatically assured
2075,8975-270782-0093,and most customary choice and that not until later is there any resistance the source of which probably is to be found in the individual psychology
2076,8975-270782-0094,toward the understanding of the dream we found not only that the materials of forgotten childhood experiences are accessible to the dream
2077,8975-270782-0095,with all its peculiarities its egoism its incestuous love choice et cetera continues for the purposes of the dream in the unconscious
2078,8975-270782-0096,infantile side of psychic life which we may find in action in children which we overlook partly because of the slightness of its dimensions partly because it is lightly considered since we demand no ethical heights of the child
2079,8975-270782-0097,since the dream regresses to this stage it seems to have made apparent the evil that lies in us but it is only a deceptive appearance by which we have allowed ourselves to be frightened we are not so evil as we might suspect from the interpretation of dreams
2080,8975-270782-0098,if the evil impulses of the dream are merely infantilism a return to the beginnings of our ethical development since the dream simply makes children of us again in thinking and in feeling we need not be ashamed of these evil dreams if we are reasonable
2081,8975-270782-0099,but being reasonable is only a part of psychic life many things are taking place there that are not reasonable and so it happens that we are ashamed of such dreams and unreasonably we turn them over to the dream censorship
2082,8975-270782-0100,are ashamed and angry if one of these dreams has in some unusual manner succeeded in penetrating into consciousness in an undistorted form
2083,8975-270782-0101,as we would be if we understood it just think of the scandalized opinion of the fine old lady about her uninterpreted dream of services of love the problem is not yet solved
2084,8975-270782-0102,and it is still possible that upon further study of the evil in the dream we shall come to some other decision and arrive at another valuation of human nature as a result of the whole investigation we grasp two facts
2085,8975-270782-0103,which however disclose only the beginnings of new riddles new doubts first the regression of dream work is not only formal it is also of greater import it not only translates our thoughts into a primitive form of expression
2086,8975-270782-0104,but it reawakens the peculiarities of our primitive psychic life the ancient predominance of the ego the earliest impulses of our sexual life even our old intellectual property
2087,8975-270782-0105,unconscious is no longer a name for what is at that time latent the unconscious is an especial psychic realm with wish impulses of its own with its own method of expression and with a psychic mechanism peculiar to itself
2088,8975-270782-0106,but the latent dream thoughts which we have solved by means of the dream interpretation are not of this realm they are much more nearly the same as any we may have thought in our waking hours still they are unconscious
2089,8975-270782-0107,how does one solve this contradiction we begin to see that a distinction must be made something that originates in our conscious life and that shares its characteristics
2090,8975-270782-0108,the day remnants combines in the dream fabrication
2091,8975-270782-0109,between these two parts the dream work completes itself the influencing of the day remnants by the unconscious necessitates regression this is the deepest insight into the nature of the dream
2092,8975-270782-0110,that we are able to attain without having searched through further psychic realms the time will soon come however when we shall clothe the unconscious character of the latent dream thought with another name
2093,8975-270782-0111,which shall differentiate it from the unconscious out of the realm of the infantile we may to be sure propound the question what forces the psychological activity during sleep to such regression
2094,8975-270782-0112,why do not the sleep disturbing psychic stimuli do the job without it and if they must because of the dream censorship disguise themselves through old forms of expression which are no longer comprehensible
2095,8975-270782-0113,what is the use of giving new life to old long outgrown psychic stimuli wishes and character types that is why the material regression in addition to the formal the only satisfactory answer would be this
2096,8975-270782-0114,that only in this manner can a dream be built up
2097,1502-122619-0000,brief i pray for you for you see tis a busy time with me much ado about nothing the tribe or rather half tribe of delawares
2098,1502-122619-0001,could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks
2099,1502-122619-0002,though they had seen fit with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of their ally
2100,1502-122619-0003,in various ways it was the prevalent opinion however
2101,1502-122619-0004,that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity
2102,1502-122619-0005,that their hatchets were dull and time was necessary to sharpen them the politic captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy
2103,1502-122619-0006,on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people
2104,1502-122619-0007,the women ran from lodge to lodge
2105,1502-122619-0008,a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends the warriors were lounging in groups
2106,1502-122619-0009,the instruments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges but none departed here and there a warrior was examining his arms with an attention that is rarely bestowed on the implements
2107,1502-122619-0010,when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously
2108,1502-122619-0011,as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village
2109,1502-122619-0012,he was without arms and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance when in full view of the delawares he stopped and made a gesture of amity
2110,1502-122619-0013,by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall impressively on his breast
2111,1502-122619-0014,fortified by these assurances the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace
2112,1502-122619-0015,he made as he advanced many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice the women however like one who deemed their favor in the present enterprise of no importance
2113,1502-122619-0016,his reception was grave silent and wary the warriors in front stepped aside opening the way to their most approved orator by the action
2114,1502-122619-0017,one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines the wise huron is welcome said the delaware
2115,1502-122619-0018,composed of cracked corn and beans it is much used also by the whites by corn is meant maise
2116,1502-122619-0019,he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist they once more exchanged friendly salutations
2117,1502-122619-0020,then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge and share his morning meal the invitation was accepted and the two warriors attended by three or four of the old men walked calmly away
2118,1502-122619-0021,leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short and frugal repast that followed
2119,1502-122619-0022,and related entirely to the events of the hunt in which magua had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts
2120,1502-122619-0023,notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware
2121,1502-122619-0024,is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children
2122,1502-122619-0025,when was it ever otherwise returned magua he calls my people most beloved the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued
2123,1502-122619-0026,the tomahawks of your young men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yengeese are dead and the delawares are our neighbors
2124,1502-122619-0027,the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand and remained silent then magua as if recalled to such a recollection by the allusion to the massacre demanded
2125,1502-122619-0028,does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open let her be sent to my squaws if she gives trouble to my brother
2126,1502-122619-0029,she is welcome returned the chief of the latter nation still more emphatically the baffled magua continued silent several minutes apparently indifferent however to the repulse he had received
2127,1502-122619-0030,in this his opening effort to regain possession of cora do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their hunts he at length continued
2128,1502-122619-0031,it is well justice is the master of a red skin why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers
2129,1502-122619-0032,good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time
2130,1502-122619-0033,to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares before he added have there not been strange moccasins in the woods have not my brothers scented the feet of white men
2131,1502-122619-0034,let my canada father come returned the other evasively his children are ready to see him when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams the hurons say too he is welcome
2132,1502-122619-0035,but the yengeese have long arms and legs that never tire
2133,1502-122619-0036,it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said magua once more shifting his ground
2134,1502-122619-0037,and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry
2135,1502-122619-0038,in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors one of whom was his host he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors
2136,1502-122619-0039,compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity
2137,1502-122619-0040,so aptly mingled with praise in the eyes of those he addressed this well judged and politic stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results
2138,1502-122619-0041,my brother is a wise chief he is welcome the hurons love their friends the delawares returned magua why should they not they are colored by the same sun and their just men will hunt in the same grounds after death
2139,1502-122619-0042,the red skins should be friends and look with open eyes on the white men has not my brother scented spies in the woods the delaware whose name in english signified hard heart
2140,1502-122619-0043,an appellation that the french had translated into le coeur dur forgot that obduracy of purpose
2141,1502-122619-0044,would the yengeese send their women as spies did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle he told no lie the yengeese have sent out their scouts
2142,1502-122619-0045,then they fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends their minds are turned from their canada father this insinuation was a home thrust
2143,1502-122619-0046,would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist the recent defection of the tribe had as they well knew themselves subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies
2144,1502-122619-0047,and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee
2145,1502-122619-0048,that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements their distant villages their hunting grounds
2146,1502-122619-0049,together with a material part of their physical force were actually within the limits of the french territory accordingly this alarming annunciation was received as magua intended
2147,1502-122619-0050,with manifest disapprobation if not with alarm
2148,1502-122619-0051,he will see no change it is true my young men did not go out on the war path they had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white chief
2149,1502-122619-0052,will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the camp of his children
2150,1502-122619-0053,that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delawares go my great canada father is not a fool
2151,1502-122619-0054,la longue carabine the delaware warriors started at the well known name betraying by their amazement that they now learned for the first time one so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power
2152,1502-122619-0055,what does my brother mean demanded le coeur dur in a tone that by its wonder far exceeded the usual apathy of his race a huron never lies returned magua coldly
2153,1502-122619-0056,a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in
2154,1502-122619-0057,the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated the women suspended their labors to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors
2155,1502-122619-0058,the boys deserted their sports and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the temerity of their hated foe
2156,1502-122619-0059,in short every occupation was abandoned for the time and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge after their own peculiar manner in an open expression of feeling
2157,1502-122619-0060,the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment
2158,1502-122619-0061,magua had not only maintained his seat but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge
2159,1502-122619-0062,and apparently as unconcerned as if he had no interest in the result
2160,1502-122619-0063,escaped his vigilant eyes
2161,1502-122619-0064,he anticipated every measure on which they decided and it might almost be said
2162,1502-122619-0065,and formal assemblage of the nation as such meetings were rare and only called on occasions of the last importance the subtle huron who still sat apart
2163,1502-122619-0066,now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue
2164,1502-122619-0067,in front of the encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect it might have been half an hour before each individual including even the women and children was in his place
2165,1502-122619-0068,the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain
2166,1502-122619-0069,its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls
2167,1502-122619-0070,standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious discussion
2168,1502-122619-0071,until such a one chose to make some movement no deeds in arms no natural gifts nor any renown as an orator
2169,1502-122619-0072,on the present occasion the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak was silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause
2170,1502-122619-0073,that always preceded a conference but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally an eye was raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
2171,1502-122619-0074,and three men issuing from it slowly approached the place of consultation they were all aged even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached but one in the center who leaned on his companions for support
2172,1502-122619-0075,had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain his frame which had once been tall and erect like the cedar was now bending under the pressure of more than a century
2173,1502-122619-0076,the elastic light step of an indian was gone and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground
2174,1502-122619-0077,his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders
2175,1502-122619-0078,since they had last been shorn the dress of this patriarch for such considering his vast age in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people he might very properly be termed
2176,1502-122619-0079,was rich and imposing though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe his robe was of the finest skins which had been deprived of their fur
2177,1502-122619-0080,of various deeds in arms done in former ages his bosom was loaded with medals some in massive silver and one or two even in gold
2178,1502-122619-0081,he also wore armlets and cinctures above the ankles of the latter precious metal
2179,1502-122619-0082,in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks his tomahawk was nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure
2180,1502-122619-0083,which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided
2181,1502-122619-0084,was whispered from mouth to mouth magua had often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware
2182,1502-122619-0085,with the great spirit and which has since transmitted his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his ancient territory
2183,1502-122619-0086,the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out a little from the throng
2184,1502-122619-0087,whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes
2185,1502-122619-0088,the americans sometimes called their tutelar saint tamenay a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced
2186,1502-122619-0089,the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions
2187,1502-122619-0090,with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father
2188,1502-122619-0091,who belongs rather to another world than to this was received by his people after a suitable and decent pause
2189,1502-122619-0092,and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person
2190,1502-122619-0093,so just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness
2191,1502-122619-0094,the chiefs drew back again to their several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment
2192,1502-122619-0095,arose left the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning
2193,1502-122619-0096,escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment the crowd opened in a lane and when the party had re entered
2194,1502-122615-0000,pope's iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear the hurons are dogs
2195,1502-122615-0001,the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior tremble the gray head and the sagamore are safe
2196,1502-122615-0002,go uncas and the open hand are now strangers it is enough
2197,1502-122615-0003,but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh
2198,1502-122615-0004,the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the lodge and exhibited the figure of uncas
2199,1502-122615-0005,after this termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran
2200,1502-122615-0006,he retraced his steps to the council lodge resolved to seek and question david in order to put an end to his doubts on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution
2201,1502-122615-0007,though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far the terrible scene that had just occurred
2202,1502-122615-0008,proved favorable to his views and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage without seeming to hesitate
2203,1502-122615-0009,he walked into the lodge and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that though uncas still remained where he had left him
2204,1502-122615-0010,david had not reappeared no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway
2205,1502-122615-0011,in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition
2206,1502-122615-0012,he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent resolution his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed
2207,1502-122615-0013,he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him my canada father does not forget his children said the chief
2208,1502-122615-0014,i thank him an evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men can the cunning stranger frighten him away heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the indians
2209,1502-122615-0015,in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal
2210,1502-122615-0016,that would have given him more satisfaction aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character however he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery spirits differ
2211,1502-122615-0017,the huron was content with the assurance and resuming his pipe he awaited the proper moment to move the impatient heyward inwardly execrating the cold customs of the savages
2212,1502-122615-0018,equal to that maintained by the chief who was in truth a near relative of the afflicted woman the minutes lingered and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in empiricism when the huron laid aside his pipe
2213,1502-122615-0019,and drew his robe across his breast as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid just then a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door and stalking silently among the attentive group
2214,1502-122615-0020,he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua
2215,1502-122615-0021,several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again
2216,1502-122615-0022,drew his tomahawk from his girdle and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle
2217,1502-122615-0023,ten minutes which appeared so many ages to duncan might have passed in this manner and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke
2218,1502-122615-0024,has my friend found the moose the young men stagger under their burdens returned magua let reed that bends go on the hunting path he will meet them a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name
2219,1502-122615-0025,as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant the smoke wreathed above their heads in little eddies
2220,1502-122615-0026,leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes
2221,1502-122615-0027,the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth
2222,1502-122615-0028,suffered their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white headed savage
2223,1502-122615-0029,like most around him for more than a minute his look too was on the ground but trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention
2224,1502-122615-0030,then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence it was a lie he said i had no son he who was called by that name is forgotten
2225,1502-122615-0031,the wicked chippewas cheated my squaw
2226,1502-122615-0032,he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself i have done the speaker who was the father of the recreant young indian looked round and about him
2227,1502-122615-0033,the expression of his eye contradicted his figurative and boastful language
2228,1502-122615-0034,standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as if sickening at the gaze of men and veiling his face in his blanket he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking
2229,1502-122615-0035,in the privacy of his own abode the sympathy of one like himself aged forlorn and childless the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects in character
2230,1502-122615-0036,suffered him to depart in silence then with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men
2231,1502-122615-0037,but who has ever found a huron asleep the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed the delawares of the lakes
2232,1502-122615-0038,not so they who wear the petticoats of squaws on their own river one of them has been passing the tribe did my young men take his scalp
2233,103-1241-0000,chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
2234,103-1241-0001,or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
2235,103-1241-0002,matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
2236,103-1241-0003,he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
2237,103-1241-0004,and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
2238,103-1241-0005,he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
2239,103-1241-0006,matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
2240,103-1241-0007,and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
2241,103-1241-0008,the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl she's sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
2242,103-1241-0009,she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled
2243,103-1241-0010,guess there's some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently that's all i know about it and i haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
2244,103-1241-0011,i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain
2245,103-1241-0012,maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
2246,103-1241-0013,and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
2247,103-1241-0014,a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
2248,103-1241-0015,her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
2249,103-1241-0016,might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
2250,103-1241-0017,was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
2251,103-1241-0018,i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me
2252,103-1241-0019,i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night
2253,103-1241-0020,i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you
2254,103-1241-0021,matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldn't be left at bright river anyhow
2255,103-1241-0022,no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables i'm sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
2256,103-1241-0023,it isn't heavy i've got all my worldly goods in it but it isn't heavy and if it isn't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so i'd better keep it because i know the exact knack of it it's an extremely old carpet bag oh i'm very glad you've come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
2257,103-1241-0024,we've got to drive a long piece haven't we missus spencer said it was eight miles i'm glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that i'm going to live with you and belong to you i've never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst i've only been in it four months but that was enough
2258,103-1241-0025,it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
2259,103-1241-0026,they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
2260,103-1241-0027,who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones
2261,103-1241-0028,i do love to imagine i'm nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthew's companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
2262,103-1241-0029,the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
2263,103-1241-0030,isn't that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
2264,103-1241-0031,i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular
2265,103-1241-0032,but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then
2266,103-1241-0033,i can imagine that i'm dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldn't sell it
2267,103-1241-0034,but i'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldn't you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while
2268,103-1241-0035,and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
2269,103-1241-0036,she said she hadn't time to get sick watching to see that i didn't fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy i did prowl isn't it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didn't know whether i'd ever have another opportunity
2270,103-1241-0037,oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
2271,103-1241-0038,and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
2272,103-1241-0039,and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew
2273,103-1241-0040,there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew
2274,103-1241-0041,was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
2275,103-1241-0042,he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different
2276,103-1241-0043,and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
2277,103-1240-0000,chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
2278,103-1240-0001,that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lynde's hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
2279,103-1240-0002,for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
2280,103-1240-0003,and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own
2281,103-1240-0004,but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
2282,103-1240-0005,helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
2283,103-1240-0006,as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
2284,103-1240-0007,anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachel's all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
2285,103-1240-0008,the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lynde's husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
2286,103-1240-0009,missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
2287,103-1240-0010,peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill
2288,103-1240-0011,and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
2289,103-1240-0012,had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
2290,103-1240-0013,he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didn't happen often missus rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it
2291,103-1240-0014,and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
2292,103-1240-0015,if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more
2293,103-1240-0016,yet something must have happened since last night to start him off i'm clean puzzled that's what and i won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
2294,103-1240-0017,the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him
2295,103-1240-0018,had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
2296,103-1240-0019,barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all it's just staying that's what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
2297,103-1240-0020,bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure
2298,103-1240-0021,they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
2299,103-1240-0022,set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
2300,103-1240-0023,one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
2301,103-1240-0024,or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
2302,103-1240-0025,whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
2303,103-1240-0026,and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
2304,103-1240-0027,there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
2305,103-1240-0028,yet what of matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isn't it won't you sit down
2306,103-1240-0029,how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
2307,103-1240-0030,thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
2308,103-1240-0031,but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor we're all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you weren't though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctor's
2309,103-1240-0032,marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
2310,103-1240-0033,matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
2311,103-1240-0034,she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
2312,103-1240-0035,said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
2313,103-1240-0036,marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
2314,103-1240-0037,what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
2315,103-1240-0038,missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
2316,103-1240-0039,so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help
2317,103-1240-0040,there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
2318,103-1240-0041,they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
2319,103-1240-0042,so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencer's folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age
2320,103-1240-0043,old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
2321,103-1240-0044,so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
2322,103-1240-0045,well marilla i'll just tell you plain that i think you're doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing that's what you don't know what you're getting you're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
2323,103-1240-0046,nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
2324,103-1240-0047,and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what
2325,103-1240-0048,this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
2326,103-1240-0049,it's so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel it's my duty to give in and as for the risk there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world there's risks in people's having children of their own if it comes to that they don't always turn out well
2327,103-1240-0050,and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
2328,103-1240-0051,only don't say i didn't warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well we're not getting a girl said marilla
2329,103-1240-0052,as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
2330,103-1240-0053,missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
2331,103-1240-0054,and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marilla's relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachel's pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
2332,103-1240-0055,it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather
2333,103-1240-0056,it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything
2334,103-1240-0057,my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart
2335,311-124404-0000,i would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which i deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions
2336,311-124404-0001,i believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truths are that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage
2337,311-124404-0002,i have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which i have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of god and of the soul
2338,311-124404-0003,and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had formerly appeared and yet i venture to state that not only have i found means
2339,311-124404-0004,to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner
2340,311-124404-0005,and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering
2341,311-124404-0006,but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade
2342,311-124404-0007,fearing lest i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind i resolved to expound singly though at considerable length my opinions regarding light then
2343,311-124404-0008,to take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed stars since light almost wholly proceeds from them on the heavens since they transmit it on the planets comets and earth since they reflect it and particularly
2344,311-124404-0009,on all the bodies that are upon the earth since they are either colored or transparent or luminous and finally on man since he is the spectator of these objects
2345,311-124404-0010,further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned
2346,311-124404-0011,i resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces
2347,311-124404-0012,matter sufficient to compose one and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned
2348,311-124404-0013,and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established on this supposition i in the first place described this matter
2349,311-124404-0014,and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul
2350,311-124404-0015,for i even expressly supposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are so debated in the schools nor in general anything the knowledge of which is not so natural to our minds
2351,311-124404-0016,i endeavored to demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt
2352,311-124404-0017,that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way
2353,311-124404-0018,as to present the appearance of heavens how in the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets and others a sun and fixed stars and making a digression at this stage on the subject of light
2354,311-124404-0019,i expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be
2355,311-124404-0020,and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth to this i likewise added much respecting the substance the situation the motions
2356,311-124404-0021,and all the different qualities of these heavens and stars so that i thought i had said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in the heavens or stars of our system that must not or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which i described
2357,311-124404-0022,i came next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i had expressly supposed that god had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly
2358,311-124404-0023,to that observed in our seas as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such as is likewise observed between the tropics how the mountains seas fountains and rivers might naturally be formed in it
2359,311-124404-0024,and the metals produced in the mines and the plants grow in the fields and in general how all the bodies which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and among other things in the discoveries alluded to
2360,311-124404-0025,i knew nothing except fire which produces light i spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature the manner of its production and support and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light and light without heat
2361,311-124404-0026,to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others how it can consume almost all bodies or convert them into ashes and smoke
2362,311-124404-0027,and finally how from these ashes
2363,311-124404-0028,for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature i took a special pleasure in describing it i was not however disposed from these circumstances
2364,311-124404-0029,to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described
2365,311-124404-0030,but this is certain and an opinion commonly received among theologians that the action by which he now sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it
2366,311-124404-0031,so that even although he had from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos provided only he had established certain laws of nature and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do
2367,311-124404-0032,it may be believed without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone things purely material might in course of time
2368,311-124404-0033,from the description of inanimate bodies and plants i passed to animals and particularly to man
2369,311-124404-0034,but since i had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the rest that is to say by deducing effects from their causes and by showing
2370,311-124404-0035,nature must produce them i remained satisfied with the supposition that god formed the body of man wholly like to one of ours as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs
2371,311-124404-0036,of the same matter with that i had described and at first placed in it no rational soul nor any other principle in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light
2372,311-124404-0037,and which i thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit for when i examined the kind of functions which might
2373,311-124404-0038,as consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently
2374,311-124404-0039,consists in thinking functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us but among which i could not discover any of those that as dependent on thought alone belong to us as men
2375,311-124404-0040,while on the other hand i did afterwards discover these as soon as i supposed god to have created a rational soul and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which i described
2376,311-124404-0041,will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest
2377,311-124404-0042,to take the trouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large animal possessed of lungs
2378,311-124404-0043,and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tubes viz the hollow vein vena cava
2379,311-124404-0044,which is the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately so denominated
2380,311-124404-0045,presently disperse themselves all over the lungs in the second place the cavity in the left side
2381,311-124404-0046,two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs
2382,311-124404-0047,where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein and those of the tube called the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issuing from the heart sends its branches all over the body
2383,311-124404-0048,i should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the eleven pellicles which like so many small valves open and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities viz
2384,311-124404-0049,three at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out three at the entrance to the arterial vein
2385,311-124404-0050,which arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former readily permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity and in like manner
2386,311-124404-0051,two others at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but preclude its return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart
2387,311-124404-0052,but prevent its reflux nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation can be adequately closed with two
2388,311-124404-0053,whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture
2389,311-124404-0054,and there form as it were two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body
2390,311-124404-0055,and finally that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel
2391,311-124404-0056,for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood
2392,311-124404-0057,into these the blood of necessity flows from the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these two vessels are always full of blood and their orifices which are turned towards the heart cannot then be closed
2393,311-124404-0058,because the orifices through which they pass are wide
2394,311-124404-0059,are immediately rarefied and dilated by the heat they meet with in this way they cause the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances
2395,311-124404-0060,of the two vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels through which they pass out
2396,311-124404-0061,causing in this way all the branches of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract as do also the arteries
2397,311-124404-0062,and the six small valves close and the five of the hollow
2398,311-124404-0063,venous artery open anew and allow a passage
2399,311-124404-0064,which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before and because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes
2400,311-124404-0065,it thence happens that their motion is the contrary of that of the heart and that when it expands they contract but lest those who are ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish
2401,311-124404-0066,true reasons from mere verisimilitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily
2402,311-124404-0067,from the very arrangement of the parts which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience as does the motion of a clock from the power
2403,311-124404-0068,the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted
2404,311-124404-0069,and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins
2405,311-124404-0070,so that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation of this we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons who by binding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where they open the vein
2406,311-124404-0071,cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature whereas quite the contrary would happen were they to bind it below that is between the hand and the opening or were to make the ligature above
2407,311-124404-0072,the opening very tight for it is manifest that the tie moderately straightened while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins cannot on that account prevent new blood
2408,311-124404-0073,from coming forward through the arteries because these are situated below the veins and their coverings from their greater consistency are more difficult to compress and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them
2409,311-124404-0074,to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins there must of necessity
2410,311-124404-0075,which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut
2411,311-124404-0076,so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there are many other circumstances which evince that what i have alleged
2412,311-124404-0077,is the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins and that from the arteries can only arise from this
2413,311-124404-0078,and more vivid and warmer immediately after leaving the heart in other words when in the arteries than it was a short time before passing into either in other words when it was in the veins
2414,311-124404-0079,and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart
2415,311-124404-0080,in parts more remote from it in the next place
2416,311-124404-0081,sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins and why should the left cavity of the heart
2417,311-124404-0082,and the arterial vein were it not that the blood of the venous artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and rarefies more readily and in a higher degree
2418,311-124404-0083,whence it happens that if the blood be withdrawn from any part the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means and although the heart were as hot as glowing iron it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands
2419,311-124404-0084,and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb
2420,311-124404-0085,when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times in a day
2421,311-124404-0086,and the production of the different humors of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being rarefied passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive
2422,311-124404-0087,and there occupy the place of some others expelled by them and that according to the situation shape or smallness of the pores with which they meet some rather than others flow into certain parts
2423,311-124404-0088,which by being variously perforated serve to separate different species of grain and in the last place what above all is here worthy of observation
2424,311-124404-0089,is the generation of the animal spirits which are like a very subtle wind or rather a very pure and vivid flame which
2425,311-124404-0090,ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain thence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles and gives motion to all the members so that to account for other parts of the blood which as most agitated and penetrating
2426,311-124404-0091,proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart
2427,311-124404-0092,in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point
2428,311-124404-0093,which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it
2429,311-124404-0094,i had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treatise which i formerly thought of publishing and after these i had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscles of the human body
2430,311-124404-0095,to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth although no longer animated what changes must take place in the brain to produce
2431,311-124404-0096,waking sleep and dreams how light sounds odors tastes heat and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means of the senses how hunger
2432,311-124404-0097,thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it divers ideas what must be understood by the common sense sensus communis in which these ideas are received by the memory which retains them
2433,311-124404-0098,by the fantasy which can change them in various ways and out of them compose new ideas and which by the same means distributing the animal spirits through the muscles can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways
2434,311-124404-0099,to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata or moving machines fabricated by human industry and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones
2435,311-124404-0100,muscles nerves arteries veins and other parts that are found in the body of each animal such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of god which is incomparably better arranged
2436,311-124404-0101,and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine of human invention and here i specially stayed to show that were there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal
2437,311-124404-0102,we could have no means of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals but if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible
2438,311-124404-0103,our thoughts to others for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs
2439,311-124404-0104,for example if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it is hurt and such like
2440,311-124404-0105,appositely to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us
2441,311-124404-0106,these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient
2442,311-124404-0107,that there are no men so dull and stupid not even idiots as to be incapable of joining together different words and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood
2443,311-124404-0108,destitute of the organs which others use in speaking are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their thoughts to those who being usually in their company have leisure to learn their language
2444,311-124404-0109,and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak
2445,311-124404-0110,and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species as well as among men and since some are more capable of being instructed than others it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species
2446,311-124404-0111,should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack brained unless the soul of brutes
2447,311-124404-0112,and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brutes speak although we do not understand their language
2448,311-124404-0113,since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows
2449,311-124404-0114,that though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others so that the circumstance that they do better
2450,311-124404-0115,and could surpass us in all things on the contrary it rather proves that they are destitute of reason and that it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs thus it is seen that a clock composed only of wheels and weights
2451,311-124404-0116,can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter
2452,311-124404-0117,as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members
2453,311-124404-0118,but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man
2454,311-124404-0119,there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue
2455,311-124404-0120,and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for or fear more than flies and ants in place of which when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the reasons which establish
2456,311-124404-0121,because no other causes are observed capable of destroying it
2457,4788-94904-0000,we have recognized in representative government the ideal type of the most perfect polity for which in consequence any portion of mankind are better adapted in proportion to their degree of general improvement as they range lower and lower in development
2458,4788-94904-0001,that form of government will be generally speaking less suitable to them though this is not true universally for the adaptation of a people to representative government does not depend so much upon the place they occupy in the general scale of humanity
2459,4788-94904-0002,as upon the degree in which they possess certain special requisites requisites however so closely connected with their degree of general advancement that any variation between the two is rather the exception than the rule
2460,4788-94904-0003,that they should be willing and able to fulfill the duties and discharge the functions which it imposes on them the willingness of the people to accept representative government only becomes a practical question when an enlightened ruler or a foreign nation or nations
2461,4788-94904-0004,who have gained power over the country are disposed to offer it the boon to individual reformers the question is almost irrelevant since if no other objection can be made to their enterprise than that the opinion of the nation is not yet on their side
2462,4788-94904-0005,they have the ready and proper answer that to bring it over to their side is the very end they aim at when opinion is really adverse its hostility is usually to the fact of change rather than to representative government in itself
2463,4788-94904-0006,the contrary case is not indeed unexampled there has sometimes been a religious repugnance to any limitation of the power of a particular line of rulers but in general the doctrine of passive obedience meant only submission to the will of the powers that be
2464,4788-94904-0007,whether monarchical or popular in any case in which the attempt to introduce representative government is at all likely to be made indifference to it
2465,4788-94904-0008,rather than positive opposition are the obstacles to be expected these however are as fatal and may be as hard to be got rid of as actual aversion it being easier in most cases to change the direction of an active feeling than to create one
2466,4788-94904-0009,in a state previously passive when a people have no sufficient value for and attachment to a representative constitution they have next to no chance of retaining it
2467,4788-94904-0010,and is in direct contact with the public to it principally the hopes and fears of individuals are directed and by it both the benefits and the terrors and prestige of government are mainly represented to the public eye
2468,4788-94904-0011,unless therefore the authorities whose office it is to check the executive are backed by an effective opinion and feeling in the country the executive has always the means of setting them aside or compelling them to subservience
2469,4788-94904-0012,and is sure to be well supported in doing so representative institutions necessarily depend for permanence upon the readiness of the people to fight for them in case of their being endangered if too little valued for this
2470,4788-94904-0013,they seldom obtain a footing at all and if they do are almost sure to be overthrown as soon as the head of the government or any party leader who can muster force for a coup de main is willing to run some small risk for absolute power
2471,4788-94904-0014,these considerations relate to the first two causes of failure in a representative government the third is when the people want either the will or the capacity to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution
2472,4788-94904-0015,when nobody or only some small fraction feels the degree of interest in the general affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion the electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their private interest or the interest of their locality
2473,4788-94904-0016,or of some one with whom they are connected as adherents or dependents the small class who in this state of public feeling gain the command of the representative body for the most part use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune if the executive is weak
2474,4788-94904-0017,the country is distracted by mere struggles for place if strong it makes itself despotic at the cheap price of appeasing the representatives or such of them as are capable of giving trouble by a share of the spoil
2475,4788-94904-0018,and the only fruit produced by national representation is that in addition to those who really govern there is an assembly quartered on the public and no abuse in which a portion of the assembly are interested is at all likely to be removed
2476,4788-94904-0019,when however the evil stops here the price may be worth paying for the publicity and discussion which though not an invariable are a natural accompaniment of any even nominal representation
2477,4788-94904-0020,that the place hunters who chiefly compose the representative assembly though they contribute little or nothing directly to good government nor even much temper the arbitrary power of the executive
2478,4788-94904-0021,which exists in that country this benefit however is entirely dependent on the coexistence with the popular body of an hereditary king if instead of struggling for the favors of the chief ruler these selfish and sordid factions struggled for the chief place itself
2479,4788-94904-0022,they would certainly as in spanish america keep the country in a state of chronic revolution and civil war a despotism not even legal but of illegal violence would be alternately exercised by a succession of political adventurers
2480,4788-94904-0023,and the name and forms of representation would have no effect but to prevent despotism from attaining the stability and security by which alone its evils can be mitigated or its few advantages realized
2481,4788-94904-0024,there are others in which it possibly might exist but in which some other form of government would be preferable these are principally when the people in order to advance in civilization have some lesson to learn some habit not yet acquired
2482,4788-94904-0025,to the acquisition of which representative government is likely to be an impediment the most obvious of these cases is the one already considered in which the people have still to learn the first lesson of civilization that of obedience
2483,4788-94904-0026,a race who have been trained in energy and courage by struggles with nature and their neighbors but who have not yet settled down into permanent obedience to any common superior would be little likely to acquire this habit under the collective government of their own body
2484,4788-94904-0027,a representative assembly drawn from among themselves would simply reflect their own turbulent insubordination it would refuse its authority to all proceedings which would impose on their savage independence any improving restraint
2485,4788-94904-0028,a military leader is the only superior to whom they will submit except occasionally some prophet supposed to be inspired from above or conjurer regarded as possessing miraculous power these may exercise a temporary ascendancy
2486,4788-94904-0029,but as it is merely personal it rarely effects any change in the general habits of the people unless the prophet like mohammed is also a military chief and goes forth the armed apostle of a new religion
2487,4788-94904-0030,or unless the military chiefs ally themselves with his influence and turn it into a prop for their own government a people are no less unfitted for representative government by the contrary fault to that last specified by extreme passiveness
2488,4788-94904-0031,and ready submission to tyranny if a people thus prostrated by character and circumstances could obtain representative institutions they would inevitably choose their tyrants as their representatives and the yoke would be made heavier on them by the contrivance which
2489,4788-94904-0032,might be expected to lighten it on the contrary many a people has gradually emerged from this condition by the aid of a central authority whose position has made it the rival and has ended by making it the master of the local despots
2490,4788-94904-0033,even when the king was scarcely so powerful as many of his chief feudatories the great advantage which he derived from being but one has been recognized by french historians to him the eyes of all the locally oppressed were turned
2491,4788-94904-0034,he was the object of hope and reliance throughout the kingdom while each local potentate was only powerful within a more or less confined space at his hands refuge and protection were sought from every part of the country against first one
2492,4788-94904-0035,then another of the immediate oppressors his progress to ascendancy was slow but it resulted from successively taking advantage of opportunities which offered themselves only to him it was therefore sure and in proportion as it was accomplished
2493,4788-94904-0036,it abated in the oppressed portion of the community the habit of submitting to oppression the king's interest lay in encouraging all partial attempts on the part of the serfs to emancipate themselves from their masters and place themselves in immediate subordination to himself
2494,4788-94904-0037,under his protection numerous communities were formed which knew no one above them but the king
2495,4788-94904-0038,and the monarch was long compelled by necessities of position to exert his authority as the ally rather than the master of the classes whom he had aided in affecting their liberation in this manner a central power despotic in principle
2496,4788-94904-0039,though generally much restricted in practice was mainly instrumental in carrying the people through a necessary stage of improvement which representative government if real would most likely have prevented them from entering upon
2497,4788-294466-0000,mary's nettlesome brown pony was hard to quiet until jerry reached out a strong brown hand and patted its head mary lifted startled blue eyes jerry what do you make of that she asked
2498,4788-294466-0001,we couldn't have imagined that gun shot and surely the horses heard it also jerry's smile was reassuring twas the story that frightened you girls i reckon he said glancing about and up and down the road as he spoke
2499,4788-294466-0002,he must have been dead for years if he was old when jerry's father was a boy of course dora less inclined to be imaginative replied then to the cowboy she said in her practical matter of fact way
2500,4788-294466-0003,hurry along home to your milking jerry and dick don't you bother to come with us now that you're working on the newcomb ranch you ought to be there it's only a few miles up over this sunshiny road to gleeson we aren't the least bit afraid to ride home alone are we
2501,4788-294466-0004,she smiled at her friend mary not wishing to appear foolishly timid said in as courageous a voice as she could muster of course we're not afraid goodbye boys we'll see you tomorrow
2502,4788-294466-0005,feeling assured that the girls were all right the boys went at a gallop down the road and across the desert valley to the newcomb ranch
2503,4788-294466-0006,they're nice boys aren't they mary said i've always wished i had a brother and i do believe jerry is going to be just like one aloud dora replied i have noticed that sometimes he calls you little sister to herself she thought
2504,4788-294466-0007,oh mary how blind you are dreamily the younger girl was saying that's because we were playmates when we were little so very long ago oh my how ancient we are dora said teasingly
2505,4788-294466-0008,please remember that you are only one year younger than i am and i refuse to be called elderly mary smiled faintly but it was evident that she was still thinking of the past when she had been a little girl with golden curls that hung to her waist a wonderfully pretty wistful little girl
2506,4788-294466-0009,when she spoke she said it's only natural that jerry should call me little sister our mothers were like sisters when they were girl brides i've told you how they both came from the east just as we have my mother met dad in bisbee where he was a mining engineer
2507,4788-294466-0010,and jerry's mother taught a little desert school over near the newcomb ranch she didn't teach long though for that very first vacation she married jerry's cowboy father after that mother and missus newcomb were good friends naturally being brides and neighbors
2508,4788-294466-0011,when jerry and i were little we were playmates i spent days at the ranch sometimes her sweet face was very sad as she ended with until mother died when i was eight then you came east to boarding school and became like a sister to me
2509,4788-294466-0012,far below them the desert valley stretched many miles southward to the mexican border the girls could see a distant blue haze that was the smoke from the douglas copper smelters the late afternoon sun lay in floods of silver light on the sandy road ahead of them
2510,4788-294466-0013,it was very still not a sound was to be heard now and then a rabbit darted past silently how peaceful this hour is on the desert mary began glancing at her friend who was riding so close at her side
2511,4788-294466-0014,noticing that dora was deep in thought she asked lightly won't you say it out loud why of course i was just wondering why jerry hurried us away so fast from lucky loon's rock house because he had to do the milking mary replied simply
2512,4788-294466-0015,dora nodded so he said then she hastened to add oh don't think i'm inferring that jerry told an untruth but you know that some evenings he has stayed with us for supper and mary glanced up startled dora bellman she said
2513,4788-294466-0016,i don't believe he will tell us about that i acted so like a scare cat all the time we were there he won't ever take us there again and he probably won't tell us the story either then i'll find it out some other way dora declared
2514,4788-294466-0017,i'm crazy about mysteries as you know and if there really is one about that rock house i want to try to solve it she said no more about it just then as they had reached the old ghost town of gleeson
2515,4788-294466-0018,in the long ago days when the town had been teeming with life picturesque looking miners and ranchers had sat there tilted back smoking pipes and swapping yarns today the chairs were empty an old man shriveled
2516,4788-294466-0019,gray bearded unkempt but with kind gray eyes deep sunken under shaggy brows stood in the open door he smiled out at them in a friendly way then beckoned with a bony finger
2517,4788-294466-0020,i do believe mister harvey has a letter for us dora said the old man had shuffled into the dark well of his store a moment later he reappeared with several letters and a newspaper good
2518,4788-294466-0021,dora exclaimed as she rode close to the porch thanks a lot she called brightly up to the old man who was handing the packet down over the sagging wooden rail his friendly toothless smile was directed at the smaller girl
2519,4788-294466-0022,he said mis farley yer nurse woman came down ter mail some letters a spell back then before mary could reply he continued in his shrill wavering voice
2520,4788-294466-0023,pale fellar wi specs on is her son ain't he yes mister harvey dick is missus farley's son mary took time in a friendly way to satisfy the old man's curiosity
2521,4788-294466-0024,dick has been going to the arizona state university this winter to be near his mother she's a widow and he's her only son her husband was a doctor and they lived back in boston before he died dew tell the old man wagged his head sympathetically
2522,4788-294466-0025,bustin broncs mary smiled in appreciation of the old man's joke no jerry won't expect dick to do that right at first he's official fence mender just at present dora defended the absent boy mister harvey
2523,4788-294466-0026,you wait until dick has been on the desert long enough to get a coat of tan he may surprise you
2524,4788-294466-0027,some with broken windows and doors others with sagging roofs and crumbling walls the only sign of life was in three small adobes where poor mexican families lived broken windows in two of the houses were stuffed with rags
2525,4788-294466-0028,a bright black eyed mexican boy of about ten ran out to the road as the girls approached come on emanuel mary sang down to him you may put up our horses and earn a dime the small boy's white teeth flashed in a delighted grin
2526,4788-294466-0029,his brown feet raced so fast that by the time the girls were dismounting before the big square two storied adobe near the mountains emanuel was there to lead their horses around back mary glanced affectionately at the old place with its flower edged walk
2527,4788-294466-0030,its broad porch and adobe pillars here her mother had come as a bride here mary had been born eight happy years they had spent together before her mother died after mary had been taken east to school her father had returned
2528,4788-294466-0031,then glancing up at the nurse who had appeared from her father's bedroom she asked eagerly may i tell dad an adventure we've had missus farley middle aged kind faced shook her head smiling down at the girl not tonight please won't tomorrow do
2529,4788-91208-0000,it looks big and important and it makes a great noise even people a long way up in the scale of civilization are in the habit of taking these attributes perhaps not as the essential ones of leadership but at all events as those by which a leader may be recognized
2530,4788-91208-0001,the pointsman moves a handle and the foaming giant that would it may be have sped on to his destruction and that of the passive crew who follow in his rear is shunted to another line running in a different direction and to a more desirable goal
2531,4788-91208-0002,the great intellectual pointsman of our age the man who has done more than any other of this generation to give direction to the thought of his contemporaries has passed away and we are left to measure the loss to humanity by the result of his labors
2532,4788-91208-0003,mister mill's achievements in both branches of philosophy are such as to give him the foremost place in either whether we regard him as an expounder of the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of society he is
2533,4788-91208-0004,the structure raised by adam smith malthus and ricardo but raised it at least one story higher his inestimable system of logic was a revolution it hardly needs of course to be said that he owed much to his predecessors
2534,4788-91208-0005,that he borrowed from whewell much of his classification from brown the chief lines of his theory of causation from sir john herschel the main principles of the inductive methods those who think this a disparagement of his work must have very little conception
2535,4788-91208-0006,of the mass of original thought that still remains to mister mill's credit the great critical power that could gather valuable truths from so many discordant sources and the wonderful synthetic ability required to weld these and his own contributions
2536,4788-91208-0007,into one organic whole when mister mill commenced his labors the only logic recognized was the syllogistic
2537,4788-91208-0008,in deducing from general propositions other propositions less general it was even asserted confidently that nothing more was to be expected that an inductive logic was impossible this conception of logical science necessitated
2538,4788-91208-0009,some general propositions to start with and these general propositions being ex
2539,4788-91208-0010,incapable of being proved from other propositions it followed that if they were known to us at all they must be original data of consciousness here was a perfect paradise of question begging the ultimate major premise in every argument being assumed
2540,4788-91208-0011,it could of course be fashioned according to the particular conclusion it was called in to prove thus an artificial ignorance as locke calls it was produced which had the effect of sanctifying prejudice by recognizing so called necessities of thought
2541,4788-91208-0012,as the only bases of reasoning it is true that outside of the logic of the schools great advances had been made in the rules of scientific investigation but these rules were not only imperfect in themselves but their connection with the law of causation
2542,4788-91208-0013,was but imperfectly realized and their true relation to syllogism hardly dreamt of mister mill altered all this he demonstrated that the general type of reasoning is neither from generals to particulars nor from particulars to generals but from particulars to particulars
2543,4788-91208-0014,but are now dead we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal we might surely without any logical inconsequence have concluded at once from those instances that the duke of wellington is mortal
2544,4788-91208-0015,the mortality of john thomas and others is after all the whole evidence we have for the mortality of the duke of wellington not one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a general proposition
2545,4788-91208-0016,we not only may according to mister mill reason from some particular instances to others but we frequently do so as however the instances which are sufficient to prove one fresh instance
2546,4788-91208-0017,the work of deduction is the interpretation of these formulas and therefore strictly speaking is not inferential at all the real inference was accomplished when the universal proposition was arrived at
2547,4788-91208-0018,all reasoning is shown to be at bottom inductive inductions and their interpretation make up the whole of logic and to induction accordingly mister mill devoted his chief attention for the first time induction was treated as the opus magnum of logic
2548,4788-91208-0019,and the fundamental principles of science traced to their inductive origin it was this taken with his theory of the syllogism which worked the great change both his system of logic and his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy
2549,4788-91208-0020,are for the most part devoted to fortifying this position and demolishing beliefs inconsistent with it as a systematic psychologist mister mill has not done so much as either professor bain or mister herbert spencer
2550,4788-91208-0021,the perfection of his method its application and the uprooting of prejudices which stood in its way this was the task to which mister mill applied himself with an ability and success rarely matched and never surpassed
2551,4788-91208-0022,the biggest lion in the path was the doctrine of so called necessary truth this doctrine was especially obnoxious to him as it set up a purely subjective standard of truth and a standard as he was easily able to show
2552,4788-91208-0023,varying according to the psychological history of the individual such thinkers as doctor whewell and mister herbert spencer had to be met in intellectual combat doctor whewell held not that the inconceivability
2553,4788-91208-0024,of the contradictory of a proposition is a proof of its truth co equal with experience but that its value transcends experience experience may tell us what is but it is by the impossibility of conceiving it otherwise
2554,4788-91208-0025,in his examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy mister mill gives battle to this mode of thought after reviewing in an opening chapter the various views which have been held respecting the relativity of human knowledge
2555,4788-91208-0026,as mister mill says the name of god is veiled under two extremely abstract phrases infinite and the absolute so profound and friendly a thinker as the late mister grote held this raising of the veil inexpedient but he proved
2556,4788-91208-0027,by a mistake he fell into the necessity of looking at the matter in the concrete he acknowledged the force of mister mill's argument that the infinite must include a farrago of contradictions
2557,4788-91208-0028,in which these contradictory attributes inhere but it was against a corresponding being the infinite that mister mill was arguing it is this that he calls a
2558,4788-91208-0029,and regarded as the reductio ad absurdissimum of the transcendental philosophy mister mill's religious tendencies may very well be gathered from a passage in his review of auguste comte a philosopher with whom he agreed on all points
2559,4788-91208-0030,and prescribe to him a rule of life that person has a religion and though every one naturally prefers his own religion to any other all must admit that if the object of his attachment and of this feeling of duty is the aggregate of our fellow creatures
2560,4788-91208-0031,this religion of the infidel cannot in honesty and conscience be called an intrinsically bad one many indeed may be unable to believe that this object is capable of gathering round it feelings sufficiently strong
2561,4788-91208-0032,and we join with him in contemning as equally irrational and mean the conception of human nature as incapable of giving its love and devoting its existence to any object which cannot afford in exchange an eternity of personal enjoyment
2562,4788-91208-0033,never has the libel of humanity involved in the current theology been more forcibly pointed out with its constant appeal to low motives of personal gain
2563,4788-91208-0034,and all his relations to his fellow creatures the very birds about his dwelling seemed to recognize it it is this noble sentiment which infuses a soul of life into his teachings and the enunciation and acting out of which constitute him
2564,2989-138035-0000,in which is related the adventure of the enamoured shepherd together with other truly droll incidents don quixote had gone but a short distance beyond don diego's village when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students and a couple of peasants
2565,2989-138035-0001,and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw don quixote for the first time and were dying to know who this man so different from ordinary men could be don quixote saluted them and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his
2566,2989-138035-0002,made them an offer of his company and begged them to slacken their pace as their young asses travelled faster than his horse and then to gratify them he told them in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed
2567,2989-138035-0003,which was that of a knight errant seeking adventures in all parts of the world he informed them that his own name was don quixote of la mancha and that he was called by way of surname the knight of the lions all this was greek or gibberish to the peasants
2568,2989-138035-0004,for all that however they regarded him with admiration and respect and one of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed road as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship come with us
2569,2989-138035-0005,who is called par excellence
2570,2989-138035-0006,as the bridegroom is called camacho the rich she is eighteen and he twenty two and they are fairly matched though some knowing ones who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart will have it that the family of the fair quiteria is better than camacho's
2571,2989-138035-0007,but no one minds that now a days for wealth can solder a great many flaws at any rate camacho is free handed
2572,2989-138035-0008,he has provided dancers too not only sword but also bell dancers for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection of shoe dancers i say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things
2573,2989-138035-0009,nor of the many others i have omitted to mention
2574,2989-138035-0010,and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents
2575,2989-138035-0011,so that the loves of the two children basilio and quiteria
2576,2989-138035-0012,he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich camacho
2577,2989-138035-0013,who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the truth be told ungrudgingly he is the most agile youth we know a mighty thrower of the bar a first rate wrestler and a great ball player he runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat
2578,2989-138035-0014,bowls over the nine pins as if by magic
2579,2989-138035-0015,and above all handles a sword as well as the best
2580,2989-138035-0016,say that to my wife said sancho who had until now listened in silence for she won't hear of anything but each one marrying his equal holding with the proverb each ewe to her like
2581,2989-138035-0017,if all those who love one another were to marry said don quixote it would deprive parents of the right to choose and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased
2582,2989-138035-0018,one would be for choosing her father's servant and another some one she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken bully
2583,2989-138035-0019,and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error
2584,2989-138035-0020,why then should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting place of death more especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed at board and everywhere as the wife is to her husband
2585,2989-138035-0021,he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter rational word and he always goes about moody and dejected talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses he eats little and sleeps little and all he eats is fruit and when he sleeps
2586,2989-138035-0022,if he sleeps at all it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast sometimes he gazes at the sky
2587,2989-138035-0023,that he might be taken for a clothed statue with its drapery stirred by the wind in short he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering that all we who know him
2588,2989-138035-0024,and any one of them or any moment the house may fall i have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all at one time
2589,2989-138035-0025,and tell me is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune no faith and between a woman's yes and no i wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin
2590,2989-138035-0026,for love i have heard say
2591,2989-138035-0027,poverty wealth and blear eyes pearls what art thou driving at sancho curses on thee said don quixote
2592,2989-138035-0028,no one can understand thee but judas himself and i wish he had thee tell me thou animal what dost thou know about nails or wheels or anything else oh if you don't understand me replied sancho it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense
2593,2989-138035-0029,but no matter i understand myself and i know i have not said anything very foolish in what i have said only your worship senor is always gravelling at everything i say nay everything i do
2594,2989-138035-0030,maybe there are toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk that is true said the licentiate for those who have been bred up in the tanneries
2595,2989-138035-0031,and yet they are all toledans pure correct
2596,2989-138035-0032,though they may have been born in majalahonda i say of discrimination because there are many who are not so and discrimination is the grammar of good language if it be accompanied by practice i sirs for my sins have studied canon law at salamanca
2597,2989-138035-0033,where you are now tail look here bachelor corchuelo returned the licentiate you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword if you think it useless it is no idea on my part but an established truth
2598,2989-138035-0034,and these joined with my resolution which is not small will make you confess that i am not mistaken dismount and put in practice your positions and circles and angles and science for i hope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship
2599,2989-138035-0035,who will make me turn my back and that there is not one in the world i will not compel to give ground as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself replied the master of fence
2600,2989-138035-0036,though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time i mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword
2601,2989-138035-0037,but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the licentiate's sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset and made him kiss it as if it were a relic though not as devoutly as relics are and ought to be kissed
2602,2989-138035-0038,the end of it was that the licentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short cassock he wore tore the skirts into strips like the tails of a cuttlefish knocked off his hat twice and so completely tired him out
2603,2989-138035-0039,that in vexation anger and rage he took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force that one of the peasants that were there who was a notary and who went for it made an affidavit afterwards that he sent it nearly three quarters of a league
2604,2989-138035-0040,by my faith senor bachelor if your worship takes my advice you will never challenge anyone to fence again only to wrestle and throw the bar for you have the youth and strength for that but as for these fencers as they call them i have heard say
2605,2989-138035-0041,they can put the point of a sword through the eye of a needle i am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey said corchuelo and with having had the truth i was so ignorant of proved to me by experience and getting up he embraced the licentiate
2606,2989-138035-0042,and they were better friends than ever and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword
2607,2989-138035-0043,they resolved to push on so as to reach the village of quiteria to which they all belonged in good time during the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on the excellences of the sword with such conclusive arguments and such figures and mathematical proofs
2608,2989-138035-0044,it grew dark but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it they heard too the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments flutes drums
2609,2989-138035-0045,psalteries pipes
2610,2989-138035-0046,were filled with lights unaffected by the wind for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees the musicians were the life of the wedding wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands some dancing
2611,2989-138035-0047,others singing others playing the various instruments already mentioned
2612,2989-138035-0048,were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow
2613,2989-138035-0049,even were it under gilded ceilings and so turned aside a little out of the road
2614,2989-138035-0050,as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don diego came back to his mind
2615,2989-138035-0051,wherein an account is given of the wedding of camacho the rich together with the incident of basilio the poor
2616,2989-138035-0052,scarce had the fair aurora given bright phoebus time to dry the liquid pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays when don quixote shaking off sloth from his limbs
2617,2989-138035-0053,sprang to his feet and called to his squire sancho who was still snoring
2618,2989-138035-0054,that without envying or being envied sleepest
2619,2989-138035-0055,to interfere with thy repose ambition breaks not thy rest nor doth this world's empty pomp disturb thee for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass
2620,2989-138035-0056,since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the support of thyself the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom have imposed upon masters the servant sleeps and the master lies awake thinking how he is to feed him advance him and reward him
2621,2989-138035-0057,he awoke at last drowsy and lazy and casting his eyes about in every direction observed there comes if i don't mistake
2622,2989-138035-0058,a wedding that begins with smells like that by my faith ought to be plentiful and unstinting have done thou glutton said don quixote come let us go and witness this bridal and see what the rejected basilio does
2623,2989-138035-0059,let him do what he likes returned sancho be he not poor he would marry quiteria to make a grand match for himself and he without a farthing is there nothing else faith
2624,2989-138035-0060,senor it's my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get
2625,2989-138035-0061,and if that be so as no doubt it is
2626,2989-138035-0062,but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash i wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are
2627,2989-138035-0063,for god's sake sancho said don quixote here
2628,2989-138035-0064,one of them was that i was to be let say all i liked so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship's authority and so far it seems to me i have not broken the said article
2629,2989-138035-0065,and even if it were so i desire you to hold your tongue and come along for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning and not in the heat of the afternoon
2630,2989-138035-0066,and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots for they were six half wine jars each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house
2631,2989-138035-0067,they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons
2632,2989-138035-0068,of over six gallons each and all filled as it proved afterwards with generous wines there were besides piles of the whitest bread like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing floors
2633,2989-138035-0069,there was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick work and two cauldrons full of oil
2634,2989-138035-0070,and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by of cooks and cook maids there were over fifty all clean brisk and blithe in the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking pigs which sewn up there
2635,2989-138035-0071,the spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter and all lay open to view in a great chest
2636,2989-138035-0072,but abundant enough to feed an army
2637,2989-138035-0073,contemplated all and everything won his heart the first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots
2638,2989-138035-0074,get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two and much good may they do you i don't see one said sancho wait a bit said the cook sinner that i am how particular and bashful you are
2639,2989-138035-0075,and so saying he seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese
2640,2989-138035-0076,fall to friend and take the edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner time comes
2641,2989-138035-0077,well then said the cook take spoon and all for camacho's wealth and happiness furnish everything
2642,2989-138035-0078,don quixote was watching the entrance at one end of the arcade of some twelve peasants all in holiday and gala dress
2643,2989-138028-0000,chapter six of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper one of the most important chapters in the whole history
2644,2989-138028-0001,but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home
2645,2989-138028-0002,what answer god will give to your complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer either i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they present every day
2646,2989-138028-0003,and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him whereupon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majesty's court are there no knights there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right there should be
2647,2989-138028-0004,to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the king's majesty then might not your worship said she be one of those that without stirring a step serve their king and lord in his court
2648,2989-138028-0005,there must be all sorts in the world
2649,2989-138028-0006,there is a great difference between one and another for the courtiers without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst
2650,2989-138028-0007,but we the true knights errant measure the whole earth with our own feet exposed to the sun to the cold to the air to the inclemencies of heaven by day and night on foot and on horseback
2651,2989-138028-0008,nor do we only know enemies in pictures but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword
2652,2989-138028-0009,whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing about but i do
2653,2989-138028-0010,and you must know besides that the true knight errant though he may see ten giants that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them and that go each of them on two tall towers by way of legs and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships and each eye like a great mill wheel
2654,2989-138028-0011,and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish
2655,2989-138028-0012,wield trenchant blades of damascus steel or clubs studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than once seen
2656,2989-138028-0013,and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second or more properly speaking first kind of knights errant for as we read in their histories
2657,2989-138028-0014,i would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights errant
2658,2989-138028-0015,for he was the most humble minded and courteous knight of his time
2659,2989-138028-0016,but some there are that might have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for they are not all courteous or mannerly some are ill conditioned scoundrels nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck
2660,2989-138028-0017,and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen
2661,2989-138028-0018,god bless me said the niece that you should know so much uncle
2662,2989-138028-0019,and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above all a caballero when you are not one
2663,2989-138028-0020,all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintained them
2664,2989-138028-0021,and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness
2665,2989-138028-0022,those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve
2666,2989-138028-0023,for examples of the second sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it
2667,2989-138028-0024,of countless princes monarchs lords medes assyrians persians greeks and barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing
2668,2989-138028-0025,for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants and even should we find one it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebeian lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
2669,2989-138028-0026,and not by spending as he pleases but by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable well bred courteous gentle mannered and kindly not haughty arrogant or censorious
2670,2989-138028-0027,but above all by being charitable for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues i have named
2671,2989-138028-0028,even though he know him not will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood and it would be strange were it not so praise has ever been the reward of virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation
2672,2989-138028-0029,there are two roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and honours one is that of letters the other that of arms
2673,2989-138028-0030,i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road
2674,2989-138028-0031,and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills fate ordains reason requires and above all my own inclination favours for knowing as i do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight errantry
2675,2989-138028-0032,i know too the infinite blessings that are attained by it i know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of vice broad and spacious i know their ends and goals are different for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death
2676,2989-138028-0033,i know as our great castilian poet says that it is by rugged paths like these they go that scale the heights of immortality unreached by those that falter here below
2677,2989-138028-0034,i can tell you niece replied don quixote if these chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties there would be nothing that i could not do nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands particularly cages and tooth picks
2678,2989-138028-0035,at this moment there came a knocking at the door
2679,2989-138028-0036,nothing senor samson said she only that my master is breaking out plainly breaking out whereabouts is he breaking out senora asked samson has any part of his body burst he is only breaking out at the door of his madness she replied
2680,2989-138028-0037,so that to bring him round again ever so little cost me more than six hundred eggs
2681,2989-138028-0038,that i can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress housekeeper that is all
2682,2989-138028-0039,say the prayer of santa apollonia that is if you know it for i will come presently and you will see miracles woe is me cried the housekeeper
2683,2989-138028-0040,that would do if it was the toothache my master had
2684,2989-138028-0041,i know what i am saying mistress housekeeper
2685,2989-138028-0042,replied carrasco and with this the housekeeper retired
2686,2989-138028-0043,and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place
2687,2989-138028-0044,once or twice as well as i remember replied sancho
2688,2989-138028-0045,for i know not what i am so focile means
2689,2989-138028-0046,and submit to what i teach thee i would bet said sancho that from the very first you understood me and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders may be so replied don quixote
2690,2989-138028-0047,but to come to the point what does teresa say teresa says
2691,2989-138028-0048,and so say i said don quixote continue sancho my friend go on you talk pearls to day the fact is continued sancho
2692,2989-138028-0049,and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased to give him
2693,2989-138028-0050,and that the same he paid me out of your estate for i don't care to stand on rewards which either come late or ill or never at all god help me with my own
2694,2989-138028-0051,and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost
2695,2989-138028-0052,and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs
2696,2989-138028-0053,please to return to my service well and good but to suppose that i am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of knight errantry is all nonsense and so my sancho get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your teresa
2697,2989-138028-0054,bene quidem if not we remain friends for if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not lack pigeons and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and a good grievance better than a bad compensation
2698,2989-138028-0055,and in short i mean to say and i do say that if you don't like to come on reward with me and run the same chance that i run god be with you
2699,2989-138028-0056,the arch wag samson came forward and embracing him as he had done before said with a loud voice o flower of knight errantry o shining light of arms o honour and mirror of the spanish nation
2700,2989-138028-0057,may god almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons who would impede or hinder thy third sally may find no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes nor ever accomplish what they most desire and then turning to the housekeeper he said
2701,2989-138028-0058,for i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did i not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit
2702,2989-138028-0059,any longer curbed and checked for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs
2703,2989-138028-0060,of the honour of virgins of the aid of widows and of the support of wives and other matters of this kind appertaining belonging proper and peculiar
2704,2989-138028-0061,on then my lord don quixote beautiful and brave let your worship and highness set out to day rather than to morrow and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose
2705,2989-138028-0062,with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight errant's squire but heaven forbid that to gratify my own inclination i should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts
2706,2989-138028-0063,let this new samson remain in his own country and bringing honour to it bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents for i will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not deign to accompany me
2707,2989-138028-0064,the bread eaten and the company dispersed
2708,2989-138028-0065,who the panzas from whom i am descended were and what is more i know and have learned
2709,2989-138028-0066,no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow which i can't deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take it amiss
2710,2989-138028-0067,and so there's nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can't be provoked
2711,2989-138028-0068,so i offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally as well and better than all the squires that served knights errant in times past or present
2712,2989-138028-0069,as he was there described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be revoked
2713,2989-138028-0070,in fine don quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who was now their oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence by which time they could have
2714,2989-138028-0071,all that was requisite for the journey ready and procure a closed helmet which don quixote said he must by all means take samson offered him one as he knew a friend of his
2715,2989-138028-0072,poured out on the bachelor were past counting they tore their hair they clawed their faces and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion
2716,2989-138028-0073,samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on
2717,2989-138028-0074,with whom he had previously discussed the subject
2718,2989-138028-0075,his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals and his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former
2719,7113-86041-0000,rubezahl over all the vast under world the mountain gnome rubezahl was lord and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him there were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through
2720,7113-86041-0001,and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies
2721,7113-86041-0002,for rubezahl loved all pretty things sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions and come out upon the green earth for a while and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing
2722,7113-86041-0003,and as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things for the first time he came up the great hills were covered with thick forests
2723,7113-86041-0004,to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills but the next time he ventured above ground what was his surprise to find everything changed the dark woods were hewn down
2724,7113-86041-0005,and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosy looking thatched cottages for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows
2725,7113-86041-0006,came the music of the shepherd's pipe the strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests who without saying by your leave or with your leave
2726,7113-86041-0007,nor did he wish to interfere with their doings but left them in quiet possession of their homes as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves
2727,7113-86041-0008,he was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called man so taking the form of an old field labourer he entered the service of a farmer under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly
2728,7113-86041-0009,but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful and rubezahl soon left him and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour
2729,7113-86041-0010,and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away that they too prospered under his care and not one was lost or torn by wolves but this new master was a hard man and begrudged him his well earned wages
2730,7113-86041-0011,so he ran away and went to serve the judge here he upheld the law with might and main and was a terror to thieves and evildoers but the judge was a bad man who took bribes and despised the law
2731,7113-86041-0012,down to his underground palace very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind but as time went on he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him and thought he would take another look at the upper world
2732,7113-86041-0013,where stood a charming maiden fresh as the spring and beautiful to look upon around her upon the grass lay her young companions as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game
2733,7113-86041-0014,beyond them flowed a little brook into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock filling the air with its pleasant sound and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide
2734,7113-86041-0015,the sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that for the first time he wished himself a mortal and longing for a better view of the gay company he changed himself into a raven
2735,7113-86041-0016,he could only see with a raven's eyes and feel as a raven feels and a nest of field mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens
2736,7113-86041-0017,when he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket and took the form of a handsome young man that was the best way and he fell in love with the girl then and there
2737,7113-86041-0018,the fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn
2738,7113-86041-0019,by the brook to rest or to bathe in the cool waters on this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood this
2739,7113-86041-0020,stepping out of his hiding place
2740,7113-86041-0021,weaving his magic spells till slowly all about him changed and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting place they stood lost in amazement and almost fancied that they must be dreaming
2741,7113-86041-0022,the red rocks had become white marble and alabaster the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed flowed in silence now in its smooth channel from which a clear fountain leapt
2742,7113-86041-0023,as the wandering breeze scattered it daisies and forget me nots fringed its brink while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable
2743,7113-86041-0024,were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them she hesitated a while however scarcely able to believe her eyes
2744,7113-86041-0025,but at length curiosity prevailed and she and her companions explored to their heart's content
2745,7113-86041-0026,running hither and thither in high glee and calling merrily to each other at last when they were quite weary the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool
2746,7113-86041-0027,which certainly did look very inviting and they all went gaily to this new amusement the princess was ready first but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down down down she sank
2747,7113-86041-0028,and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair loudly did they weep and wail running about the brink of the pool which looked so shallow and so clear
2748,7113-86041-0029,but which had swallowed up their princess before their eyes they even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her but in vain they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool and could not keep under water for a second
2749,7113-86041-0030,they saw at last that there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughter's disappearance and what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told
2750,7113-86041-0031,the scene of this strange adventure thinking as people will in sorrow that there might be some mistake after all but when he reached the spot behold all was changed again
2751,7113-86041-0032,the glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished and so had the marble bath the bower of jasmine instead all was a tangle of flowers as it had been of old
2752,7113-86041-0033,the king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princess's playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some
2753,7113-86041-0034,sprite or goblin and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy
2754,7113-86041-0035,they swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her father's seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch
2755,7113-86041-0036,wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear the gnome for he it was told her all about himself
2756,7113-86041-0037,and his great underground kingdom and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendour
2757,7113-86041-0038,on three sides of the castle lay a lovely garden with masses of gay sweet flowers and velvet lawns all cool and shady which pleased the eye of the princess the fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples
2758,7113-86041-0039,and nightingales sang in every bush as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys sometimes gazing at the moon sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment
2759,7113-86041-0040,but the princess felt no such happiness in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome however he soon perceived her melancholy
2760,7113-86041-0041,and in a thousand ways strove to dispel the cloud but in vain at last he said to himself men are sociable creatures like bees or ants
2761,7113-86041-0042,who is there i can find for her to talk to
2762,7113-86041-0043,carrots turnips and radishes and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess who sat pensive in the shade of the rose bower loveliest daughter of earth said the gnome banish all sorrow
2763,7113-86041-0044,no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling
2764,7113-86041-0045,take this little many coloured wand and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see with this he left her and the princess without an instant's delay opened the basket
2765,7113-86041-0046,this sudden appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden
2766,7113-86041-0047,and gathered the golden apples from the trees and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments
2767,7113-86041-0048,the gnome had given to his hoped for bride there they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes veils girdles and necklaces were tried on and admired
2768,7113-86041-0049,and showed so much taste that nobody
2769,7113-86041-0050,the gnome who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before
2770,7113-86041-0051,she did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand and soon had all her maidens about her and even as she had two tiny radishes to spare
2771,7113-86041-0052,whose name was beni and now all went cheerfully in the castle the princess gave to each of the maidens her task and never was mistress better served for a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed
2772,7113-86041-0053,they played from morning to night only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom
2773,7113-86041-0054,while brunhilda and the rest faded visibly they assured her that all was well with them but nevertheless they continued to waste away
2774,7113-86041-0055,take part in the games of the princess till at last one fine morning when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows she shuddered
2775,7113-86041-0056,and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones with bent backs and trembling limbs who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches and coughed dismally a little nearer to the hearth
2776,7113-86041-0057,lay the once frolicsome beni with all four feet stretched stiffly out while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion the horrified princess fled to the door
2777,7113-86041-0058,the greatest delight of my lonely hours isn't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your turning the castle into a hospital for the aged give my maidens back their youth and health this very minute or i will never love you
2778,7113-86041-0059,sweetest and fairest of damsels cried the gnome do not be angry everything that is in my power i will do but do not ask the impossible so long as the sap was fresh in the roots
2779,7113-86041-0060,the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired but as the sap dried up they withered away but never trouble yourself about that dearest one a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right
2780,7113-86041-0061,and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see the great green patch in the garden will prove you with a more lively company so saying the gnome took himself off
2781,7113-86041-0062,and the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women and left them the withered roots they really were to be thrown upon the rubbish heap and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow
2782,7113-86041-0063,to take possession of the freshly filled basket but to her surprise she could not find it anywhere up and down the garden she searched spying into every corner but not a sign of it was to be found
2783,7113-86041-0064,by the trellis of grape vines she met the gnome who was so much embarrassed at the sight of her that she became aware of his confusion while he was still quite a long way off
2784,7113-86041-0065,dear queen of my heart answered he i pray you to forgive my carelessness i promised more than i could perform i have sought all over the land for the roots you desire but they are gathered in and lie drying in musty cellars
2785,7113-86041-0066,and the fields are bare and desolate for below in the valley winter reigns only here in your presence spring is held fast and wherever your foot is set the gay flowers bloom have patience for a little
2786,7113-86041-0067,and then without fail you shall have your puppets to play with almost before the gnome had finished the disappointed princess turned away and marched off to her own apartments without deigning to answer him the gnome however
2787,7113-86041-0068,and disguising himself as a farmer bought an ass in the nearest market town and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip carrot and radish seed with this he sowed a great field
2788,7113-86041-0069,and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds thus fostered they grew and flourished marvellously
2789,7113-86041-0070,he imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him but that was a mistake for the truth was that another image already filled her heart the young prince ratibor whose lands joined her father's had won the heart of the princess
2790,7113-86041-0071,looking forward to the coming of their wedding day when the bride's mysterious disappearance took place the sad news drove ratibor distracted and as the days went on and nothing could be heard of the princess he forsook his castle
2791,7113-86041-0072,and the society of men and spent his days in the wild forests roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks meanwhile the maiden in her gorgeous prison sighed in secret over her grief not wishing to arouse the gnome's suspicions
2792,7113-86041-0073,in her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity and at last she hit upon a plan by this time spring once more reigned in the valley and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth
2793,7113-86041-0074,for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size day by day the princess pulled up some of them and made experiments with them conjuring up now this longed for person and now that
2794,7113-86041-0075,just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared but she really had another purpose in view one day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover fly
2795,7113-86041-0076,so the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up
2796,7113-86041-0077,then and there after that by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket and taught him this greeting hop little cricket to ratibor and chirp in his ear that i love him only
2797,7113-86041-0078,but that i am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains so the cricket hopped off gaily determined to do his best to deliver his message but alas a long legged stork who was prancing along the same road
2798,7113-86041-0079,caught him in her cruel beak and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat these two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more
2799,7113-86041-0080,this time she changed the turnip into a magpie flutter from tree to tree chattering bird said she till you come to ratibor my love
2800,7113-86041-0081,and bid him come with horses and men the third day from this to the hill that rises from the thorny valley the magpie listened hopped awhile from branch to branch and then darted away
2801,7113-86041-0082,now prince ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief one day as he sat in the shade of an oak tree dreaming of his lost princess and sometimes crying her name aloud
2802,7113-86041-0083,which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever thereupon he caught up a great stone
2803,7113-86041-0084,but the magpie in the tree who like
2804,7113-86041-0085,unless he could be for ever chattering
2805,7113-86041-0086,all his gloom and misery vanished in a moment and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess but the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learnt so he soon fluttered away
2806,7113-86041-0087,while the prince hurried back to his castle to gather together a troop of horsemen full of courage for whatever might befall the princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of escape
2807,7113-86041-0088,she left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference indeed there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love and the idea pleased him mightily the next day
2808,7113-86041-0089,as soon as the sun rose she made her appearance decked as a bride in the wonderful robes and jewels which the fond gnome had prepared for her her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle blossoms
2809,7113-86041-0090,and her flowing veil sparkled with gems in these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace loveliest of maidens he stammered bowing low before her let me gaze into your dear eyes
2810,7113-86041-0091,your constancy has overcome me she said i can no longer oppose your wishes but believe my words and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears why tears beloved one cried the gnome anxiously
2811,7113-86041-0092,every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold greatly as i desire your love i do not ask a sacrifice ah cried the false princess why do you misunderstand my tears
2812,7113-86041-0093,and yet i am fearful a wife cannot always charm and though you will never alter the beauty of mortals is as a flower that fades how can i be sure that you will always be as loving and charming as you are now
2813,7113-86041-0094,ask some proof sweetheart said he put my obedience and my patience to some test by which you can judge of my unalterable love be it so answered the crafty maiden then give me
2814,7113-86041-0095,that shall be the test of your truth towards me unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment he obeyed her commands without delay and hurried off to begin his task
2815,7113-86041-0096,he skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper and had soon counted them all but to be quite certain that he had made no mistake he thought he would just run over them again
2816,7113-86041-0097,this time to his great annoyance the number was different so he reckoned them for the third time but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones and this was hardly to be wondered at as his mind was full of the princess's
2817,7113-86041-0098,pretty looks and words as for the maiden no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she began to prepare for flight she had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand
2818,7113-86041-0099,which she changed into a spirited horse all saddled and bridled and springing upon its back she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the thorny valley and flung herself
2819,7113-86041-0100,into the arms of her beloved prince ratibor meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again till his back ached and his head swam and he could no longer put two and two together
2820,7113-86041-0101,but as he felt tolerably certain of the exact number of turnips in the field big and little together he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be he felt very well satisfied with himself
2821,7113-86041-0102,as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her but alas she was no longer there he searched every thicket and path he looked behind every tree and gazed into every pond
2822,7113-86041-0103,but without success then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name but only
2823,7113-86041-0104,echo answered in the marble halls there was neither voice nor footstep then he began to perceive that something was amiss and throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him he flew out of the palace
2824,7113-86041-0105,and soared high into the air and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions furiously
2825,7113-86041-0106,and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years but his fury was vain the thunderclouds melted away into a soft mist
2826,7113-86041-0107,and the gnome after flying about for a while in despair bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate went sorrowfully back to the palace and stole once more through every room with many sighs and lamentations
2827,7113-86041-0108,he passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm and the sight of the princess's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief all was lonely empty sorrowful
2828,7113-86041-0109,and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures
2829,7113-86041-0110,to the depths of his underground kingdom
2830,5390-24512-0000,for although the jewish family of the herods reigned over judea they only held their throne under the roman emperor this the jews could not endure they longed to be a free and independent nation once again
2831,5390-24512-0001,when our messiah comes he will be a great warrior they said he will utterly destroy all our enemies he will make jerusalem the greatest and richest city
2832,5390-24512-0002,had jesus of nazareth been willing to become their earthly king and to lead the nation against the romans the jews would probably have followed him to a man
2833,5390-24512-0003,the saviour sought to heal it he called out the faith and gratitude of the roman centurion and his answer to the jewish leaders render to caesar the things that are caesar's
2834,5390-24512-0004,showed them the right attitude in which to regard the roman rule
2835,5390-24512-0005,the roman government had no quarrel with him thine own nation hath delivered thee unto me
2836,5390-24512-0006,had not the jews prevented it if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend they cried
2837,5390-24512-0007,to crucify jesus of nazareth and to free barabbas but in choosing the rebel barabbas
2838,5390-24512-0008,as their hero the nation started on their downward road as the story of the forty years which followed the saviour's crucifixion clearly shows for the jews were determined at all costs to throw off the roman yoke
2839,5390-24512-0009,and the history of those years is one long list of terrible risings and massacres while cities were ruined villages wrapped in flames and men women and children perished with hunger
2840,5390-24512-0010,yet the keener the suffering the more desperate the jews became their whole souls were possessed with a wild and mad passion for revenge
2841,5390-24512-0011,then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not matthew
2842,5390-24512-0012,yet no sooner did a daring rebel or murderer gather a band of robbers around him and begin to kill and plunder than multitudes of jews cried the christ or messiah has come
2843,5390-24512-0013,where the roman soldiers were quartered and cried out to the garrison within that their lives should be spared if they would lay down their weapons the roman soldiers hesitated but the jews promised most faithfully to keep their word
2844,5390-24512-0014,the romans believed them and opened their gates but no sooner were they in the power of the jewish mob than they were fallen upon and murdered to the last man as they died the roman soldiers whom not even death could terrify
2845,5390-24512-0015,lifted up their hands to heaven as though calling upon god to witness that the jews had broken their solemn oath the roman emperor could not overlook such rebellion and treachery
2846,5390-24512-0016,and he sent a great army against jerusalem the jews shut the gates of their city and so began the awful siege of jerusalem and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies
2847,5390-24512-0017,he was a prisoner in the roman camp during the siege of jerusalem and he watched with dismay the great battering rams and war engines crashing through the walls of the holy city his ears rang with the cries of rage and despair which broke from the jews within
2848,5390-24512-0018,as one by one their defences fell and the end drew near then food failed in the city men fought like demons in the streets for a tiny loaf of barley bread so frantic were the people with hunger
2849,5390-24512-0019,that mothers even snatched the bread from their own children's mouths look over the walls o people of jerusalem the roman soldiers are crucifying all the prisoners they have taken and the line of crosses is as long as our city is wide
2850,5390-24512-0020,hard merciless as was the roman general even he grew sick with horror at last and he sent his jewish prisoner josephus to the jews promising them their lives if they would give up the city
2851,5390-24512-0021,but a furious madness had possessed the people and they refused to yield josephus pleaded in vain he was not a christian but he could see plainly enough that god was no longer with his people
2852,5390-24512-0022,ah my countrymen he cried we did nothing without god in the past but now you are fighting against him had god judged you worthy of freedom he would have punished the romans as he did the assyrians long ago
2853,5390-24512-0023,even a jew who had no faith in jesus christ could see plainly that the ancient power and glory of his nation had gone at last the end came the first wall fell
2854,5390-24512-0024,which still glittered like a hill of snow in the morning sunshine or sparkled as though wrapped in flame when the sunbeams struck full on its golden roof then redder flames than ever the sunshine made leapt above the golden roof
2855,5390-24512-0025,pillars fell beams crumbled to ashes while round the altar of sacrifice the people of jerusalem lay heaped together slain in such numbers in the holy place that their blood flowed down the broad marble steps in a heavy crimson stream
2856,5390-24512-0026,and the golden candlestick and the book of the law were carried away in triumph into heathen rome alas for the holy city over which the saviour of the world had stood and wept forty years before
2857,5390-24512-0027,knowing the suffering that lay before her these jews are dangerous we must not allow them to rebuild their city or to become a separate people again as a nation they must cease to exist
2858,5390-24512-0028,so the roman conquerors of jerusalem agreed and from that day onward the jewish people have had no country of their own they have indeed been led away captive into all nations
2859,5390-24512-0029,exactly as the lord foretold there is scarcely a country in the world where jews may not be found but jerusalem lies still in the hands of strangers and is the property of the turkish nation
2860,5390-24512-0030,the jews were now no longer a nation they had become merely a body of people led by their rabbis or teachers of the law but they were still the people of the book
2861,5390-24512-0031,they allowed the jewish teachers to continue the synagogue services in other parts of palestine and to teach in their colleges the most famous jewish college of these days was at tiberius on the shores of the sea of galilee
2862,5390-24512-0032,over whose clear depths the lord jesus christ had sailed so often and beside whose shores he had done so many wonderful deeds of love and mercy a great and beautiful college it was with broad terraced gardens
2863,5390-24512-0033,so all day long they studied and copied the old hebrew bible as we have seen the jewish scribes had not been content with taking the word of god just as it stood they had begun even in our lord's day
2864,5390-24512-0034,that they declared a man to be a blockhead if he knew only the scriptures and not the talmud explanation the law of moses is like salt but the talmud is balmy spice they would say
2865,5390-24512-0035,yet although they heeded so little the true meaning of god's book they guarded its words more and more carefully and the rules for copying any portion of the holy books were strict indeed my son an old teacher would say to his pupil
2866,5390-24512-0036,before you copy a single word you must wash your body all over and clothe yourself in full jewish dress preparing your mind with solemn thoughts the parchment you write upon must be made from the skins of clean animals only
2867,5390-24512-0037,that is clean according to the law of moses the ink you write with must be of a pure black made only from a mixture of soot charcoal and honey
2868,5390-24512-0038,though you know the whole book of the law by heart you must not write a single word from memory but raise your eyes to your copy and pronounce the word aloud before trusting it to your pen
2869,5390-24512-0039,before writing any of the names of god you must wash your pen before writing his most sacred name you must wash your whole body if after your copy has itself been examined three corrections have to be made
2870,5390-24512-0040,that copy must be destroyed not satisfied with all these directions the master taught his scholar to count the letters of every book
2871,5390-24512-0041,is the middle letter of all the five books of moses
2872,5390-24512-0042,is the middle of all the words
2873,5390-24512-0043,is the very centre of all the verses the letter a that is the hebrew letter which stands for a occurs forty two thousand three hundred seventy seven times the letter b thirty five thousand two hundred eighteen
2874,5390-24512-0044,and so on not only this but every scribe was required to know from memory exactly how many letters of each kind there should be in his sheet before he began to write every sheet of parchment must contain an equal number of lines
2875,5390-24512-0045,and the breadth of each column had to be thirty letters wide there are eleven verses in the book of the law beginning and ending with n there are forty verses in which lo is read three times and so on and so on
2876,5390-24512-0046,how tedious and meaningless such information appears of what value were all these details to spend all his days in learning such things as these could have no influence on a man's character nor make him a power for good in the world
2877,5390-24512-0047,not for this purpose had god revealed his will to man some years ago in the coffin of an egyptian mummy a little jar of wheat was found for thousands of years it had lain there shut up in the dark
2878,5390-24512-0048,while out in the fields the corn which had been sown had grown up and been reaped every year and men and women had been fed but this jar of corn was useless because it had been prevented from doing the work in the world for which it was created
2879,5390-24512-0049,just so was it with the hebrew copies of god's word locked up in a dead language kept close away from the world they were like the jar of wheat which could not grow
2880,5390-30096-0000,chapter one uncle john's farm how did i happen to own a farm asked uncle john interrupting his soup long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major doyle who sat opposite
2881,5390-30096-0001,replied the major composedly it's a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you won't look afther yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and ambitious young men who want a start in life oh uncle
2882,5390-30096-0002,do you do that exclaimed miss patricia doyle who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both so the major says answered uncle john dryly and it's true
2883,5390-30096-0003,asserted the other he's assisted three or four score young men to start in business in the last year to my certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars
2884,5390-30096-0004,and it's the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of but i'm so glad cried patsy clapping her hands with a delighted gesture it's a splendid way to do good
2885,5390-30096-0005,without capital you know many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder and many will never get it there in any event declared the major with a shake of his grizzled head
2886,5390-30096-0006,and how can i tell whether they're desarving or not retorted major doyle fiercely do ye want me to become a sleuth or engage detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy
2887,5390-30096-0007,i just have to form a judgment an take me chances and whin a poor devil goes wrong
2888,5390-30096-0008,but some of them must succeed ventured patsy in a conciliatory tone some do said john merrick and that repays me for all my trouble
2889,5390-30096-0009,queried the major you mane all my throuble well and your money
2890,5390-30096-0010,with one thing and another what of it retorted the little round faced millionaire leaning back in his chair and staring fixedly at the other that's what i employ you for now now gentlemen cried patsy earnestly
2891,5390-30096-0011,of his falling down and worshiping him john merrick was a multi millionaire to be sure but there were palliating circumstances that almost excused him he had been so busily occupied in industry
2892,5390-30096-0012,that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by accident then he promptly retired to give the other fellows a chance and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity
2893,5390-30096-0013,and the welfare and entertainment of his three nieces he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of isham marvin and company
2894,5390-30096-0014,simple in his tastes modest and retiring lacking the education and refinements of polite society but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world the little man found his greatest enjoyment in the family circle
2895,5390-30096-0015,that he had been instrumental in founding being no longer absorbed in business he had come to detest its every detail and so allowed his bankers to care for his fortune and his brother in law to disburse his income
2896,5390-30096-0016,while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable he had never married
2897,5390-30096-0017,patricia was the apple of uncle john's eye and the one goddess enshrined in her doting father's heart glancing at her
2898,5390-30096-0018,in her plain muslin gown a stranger would be tempted to wonder why she was red haired freckled as a robin's egg pug nosed and wide mouthed but her blue eyes were beautiful
2899,5390-30096-0019,and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that lent her face an indescribable charm everyone loved patsy doyle
2900,5390-30096-0020,and people would gaze longer at her smiling lips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face she was nearly seventeen years old not very tall and her form to speak charitably
2901,5390-30096-0021,he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money quite right returned uncle john nodding but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale
2902,5390-30096-0022,he was in a bad fix another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off it would take a lot of money to fight back three thousand at least
2903,5390-30096-0023,but he was decent about it after all his father had left him a little farm at millville he couldn't say what it was worth but there were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as security
2904,5390-30096-0024,if you would let him have three thousand more so you took the farm and gave him the money i did sir perhaps i am to blame
2905,5390-30096-0025,making five thousand in all well it's gone john and you've got the farm the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wegg and knocked out his patent i'm so sorry said patsy sympathetically
2906,5390-30096-0026,he replied what became of the young man asked the girl he's a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile where is millville inquired uncle john thoughtfully somewhere at the north of the state i believe
2907,5390-30096-0027,have you investigated the farm at all i looked up a real estate dealer living at millville and wrote him about the wegg farm he said if any one wanted the place very badly it might sell for three thousand dollars humph
2908,5390-30096-0028,but his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at all patsy laughed poor uncle john she said the little man however was serious
2909,5390-30096-0029,for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind years ago
2910,5390-30096-0030,beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farm's the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and we'll all have a glorious lazy time
2911,5390-30096-0031,and we can take mary along to do the cooking suggested patsy entering into the idea enthusiastically and eat in our shirt sleeves said uncle john with a glowing face and have a cow and some pigs cried the girl
2912,5390-30096-0032,you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift uncle john looked sober again anyone live on the place major he inquired
2913,5390-30096-0033,it's gone to ruin and decay the last few years
2914,5390-30102-0000,chapter seven louise scents a mystery louise merrick was the eldest of uncle john's nieces having just passed her eighteenth birthday
2915,5390-30102-0001,led a mere butterfly existence her two cousins frankly agreed that louise was shallow insincere and inclined to be affected but of the three girls
2916,5390-30102-0002,and men usually admired her graceful figure and her piquant pretty face with its crown of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression there was a rumor that she was engaged to be married to arthur weldon
2917,5390-30102-0003,a young man of position in the city but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing one of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage when away from her frivolous mother
2918,5390-30102-0004,and the inconsequent home environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency one thing was indisputable however
2919,5390-30102-0005,louise merrick was a clever girl possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of others her apparent shallowness was a blind of the same character as her assumed graciousness
2920,5390-30102-0006,and while she would have been more lovable without any pretence or sham she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was patsy and beth thought they knew her
2921,5390-30102-0007,and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin uncle john thought he knew her too and was very proud of his eldest niece in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly admirable
2922,5390-30102-0008,an extensive course of light literature not void of detective stories had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to scent a mystery in the history of captain wegg
2923,5390-30102-0009,the plain folks around millville might speculate listlessly upon the queer doin's at the farm and never get anywhere near the truth indeed the strange occurrences she had just heard
2924,5390-30102-0010,were nearly forgotten in the community and soon would be forgotten altogether unless the quick ear of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored at first she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking
2925,5390-30102-0011,it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at millville and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detective
2926,5390-30102-0012,an occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful warned however by the rebuff she had met with from uncle john the girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed investigation to anyone for the present
2927,5390-30102-0013,louise set to work to tabulate the information she had received thus far noting the element of mystery each fact evolved first captain wegg must have been a rich man in order to build this house
2928,5390-30102-0014,secondly the captain a surly and silent man had brought hither perhaps by force a young woman as his wife who was so unhappy that she pined away and died who was this woman
2929,5390-30102-0015,what had rendered her so unhappy and despairing thirdly the captain's only friend had been a crazy man named will thompson was he crazy before the captain's death or had he become crazed at that time
2930,5390-30102-0016,the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word why unless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible in the fifth place there was old hucks and his blind wife to be considered
2931,5390-30102-0017,what did they know about their old master's secret history what tragic memories lurked beneath the man's perpetual smile and the woman's composed and sightless face surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity
2932,5390-30102-0018,and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery and as instruments to the end there were several people available who could be of use to her mc nutt the agent who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell old hucks and his wife
2933,5390-30102-0019,and ethel thompson the school teacher there might be others but one or another of these four must know the truth and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once
2934,5390-30102-0020,when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs louise said to him i've been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness that's true he replied
2935,5390-30102-0021,can't we drive over to thompson's this morning uncle beth and patsy have planned a tramp to the lake and a row after water lilies then let us make our call together we can invite the girl to come here and spend a day with us
2936,5390-30102-0022,when patsy and beth will be able to meet her that's a good idea louise i was wondering what i'd do this morning tell old hucks to get the nag harnessed the girl ran eagerly upon her errand
2937,5390-30102-0023,but he turned without a word to harness the horse louise stood watching him your fingers are quite nimble thomas considering the fact that you were once a sailor she said but sailors have to be nimble miss he returned
2938,5390-30102-0024,buckling a strap unmoved who tol ye i were once a sea farin man i guessed it as he appeared indisposed to say more on the subject she asked did you sail with captain wegg partly miss dan's already now
2939,5390-30102-0025,don't jerk the bit fer his mouth's tender an it makes him balky ef he balks jest let him rest a time an then speak to him dan ain't vicious he's jest ornery she climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins
2940,5390-30102-0026,dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle john stood awaiting his niece
2941,5390-30102-0027,i understand dan well i don't returned uncle john in his whimsical way as he mounted to the seat beside her i don't understand how he's happened to live since the landing of columbus or what he's good for
2942,5390-30102-0028,or why someone don't knock him on the head dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane
2943,5390-30102-0029,do you know where the thompsons live inquired uncle john no whoa dan that was the best thing the nag did he knew how to whoa thomas called uncle john turning in his seat
2944,5390-30102-0030,and at the summons old hucks came from the barn and approached them how do you get to miss thompson's place miss ethel's another fleeting expression of surprise yes we're going over to thank her for her kindness to us
2945,5390-30102-0031,thompson's stammered hucks glancing up at them with his bright elusive smile well we're going anyhow growled mister merrick
2946,1743-142912-0000,and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear
2947,1743-142912-0001,he didn't like to admit that he couldn't recall those two cousins of chebec's did you say your fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way that's what i said replied chebec he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know
2948,1743-142912-0002,the rest of us always feel safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now
2949,1743-142912-0003,at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices
2950,1743-142912-0004,of course peter couldn't be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him
2951,1743-142912-0005,and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldn't think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw
2952,1743-142912-0006,a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latter's coat
2953,1743-142912-0007,he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was
2954,1743-142912-0008,he wasn't afraid and he intended that everybody should know it especially redtail it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling redtail a robber and every other bad name he could think of
2955,1743-142912-0009,all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him
2956,1743-142912-0010,scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing
2957,1743-142912-0011,peter couldn't help but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the flycatchers there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill
2958,1743-142912-0012,scrapper's slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air
2959,1743-142912-0013,and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebec's did when he caught a fly but it wasn't a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up
2960,1743-142912-0014,it reminded peter that he had often heard scrapper called the bee martin and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter
2961,1743-142912-0015,there wouldn't be any honey if i did
2962,1743-142912-0016,those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that don't
2963,1743-142912-0017,i'm one of farmer brown's best friends if he did but know it you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have i'd like to know who it is
2964,1743-142912-0018,there's a fly way over there beyond that old apple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldn't have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away
2965,1743-142912-0019,but if he couldn't see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrapper's bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught that fly and it had tasted good
2966,1743-142912-0020,are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him
2967,1743-142912-0021,turning away toward the green meadows instead peter didn't wait for scrapper to return
2968,1743-142912-0022,just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard some one called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way
2969,1743-142912-0023,every way but the right way look up over your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice
2970,1743-142912-0024,it was cresty the great crested flycatcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender
2971,1743-142912-0025,his throat and breast were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking
2972,1743-142912-0026,you seem to be in a hurry so don't let me detain you peter said cresty before peter could find his tongue i just want to ask one little favor of you what is it asked peter who
2973,1743-142912-0027,if in your roaming about you run across an old cast off suit of mister black snake or of any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said cresty a a
2974,1743-142912-0028,a what stammered peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied cresty somewhat impatiently now don't forget peter i've got to go house hunting but you'll find me there or hereabouts if it happens that you find one of those
2975,1743-142912-0029,cast off snake suits before peter could say another word cresty had flown away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch and then towards jenny wren's house
2976,1743-142912-0030,he just couldn't understand about those cast off suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny wren could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered lipperty lipperty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home
2977,1743-142912-0031,jenny called peter jenny wren jenny wren no one answered him he could hear mister wren singing in another tree but he couldn't see him jenny jenny wren jenny wren called peter again
2978,1743-142912-0032,this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didn't i tell you the other day peter rabbit that i'm not to be disturbed didn't i tell you that i've got seven eggs in here and that i can't spend any time gossiping
2979,1743-142912-0033,didn't i peter rabbit didn't i didn't i you certainly did jenny you certainly did and i'm sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldn't have thought of doing such a thing but i just didn't know who else to go to
2980,1743-142912-0034,go to for what snapped jenny wren what is it you've come to me for snake skins replied peter snake skins snake skins shrieked jenny wren
2981,1743-142912-0035,you don't understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to know is why should cresty the flycatcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family
2982,1743-142912-0036,he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors
2983,1743-142914-0000,he wasn't ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go
2984,1743-142914-0001,i'll just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was one of the first birds to arrive and i've neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time
2985,1743-142914-0002,off he started lipperty lipperty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows
2986,1743-142914-0003,bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground was soft in places quite muddy peter doesn't mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly
2987,1743-142914-0004,from right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head
2988,1743-142914-0005,he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled
2989,1743-142914-0006,he scared me for a second then you are even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but longbill didn't peter turned quickly there was missus woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass
2990,1743-142914-0007,i didn't mean to scare him apologized peter i really didn't mean to do you think he was really very much scared
2991,1743-142914-0008,i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger
2992,1743-142914-0009,i am glad it is no one but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it you'll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites
2993,1743-142914-0010,certainly i'll excuse you replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be longbill was making such a good meal of but peter couldn't see a thing that looked good to eat there wasn't even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground
2994,1743-142914-0011,longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion peter had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow
2995,1743-142914-0012,he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up
2996,1743-142914-0013,his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it was his head that made him look queer
2997,1743-142914-0014,his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasn't easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly longbill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length
2998,1743-142914-0015,then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbill's throat where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole
2999,1743-142914-0016,for the first time peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes exclaimed peter
3000,1743-142914-0017,and was there a worm in every one asked peter his eyes very wide with interest longbill nodded
3001,1743-142914-0018,peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface
3002,1743-142914-0019,while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there
3003,1743-142914-0020,and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in asked peter longbill chuckled
3004,1743-142914-0021,longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to peter's astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all that's the way i get them said he
3005,1743-142914-0022,i think there is one right under my feet now watch me get him longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this
3006,1743-142914-0023,that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all it's wonderful sighed peter i don't suppose any one else can find hidden worms that way my cousin jack snipe can replied longbill promptly
3007,1743-142914-0024,he feeds the same way i do only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadn't thought of him as a relative of yours before
3008,1743-142914-0025,now i must be running along i'm ever so glad to have seen you and i'm coming over to call again the first chance i get so peter said good by and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool
3009,1743-142914-0026,there was a little pebbly beach running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long slender bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black
3010,1743-142914-0027,every few steps he would stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw
3011,1743-142914-0028,it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peter's peter greeted him joyously
3012,1743-142914-0029,before peter could say another word teeter came running towards him and it was plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something don't move peter rabbit don't move he cried why not demanded peter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldn't move
3013,1743-142914-0030,just then missus teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start
3014,1743-142914-0031,missus teeter stood up and stepped aside then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for a lining four white eggs with big dark blotches on them
3015,1743-142914-0032,they looked so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but for missus teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps missus teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably
3016,1743-142914-0033,it suddenly struck peter that if he hadn't seen her do it he wouldn't have known she was there
3017,1743-142914-0034,my he exclaimed i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadn't warned me said he i'm so thankful i didn't i don't see how you dare lay them in the open like this
3018,1743-142913-0000,with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old briar patch on his way he couldn't resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard
3019,1743-142913-0001,he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying pee wee pee wee pee wee peter chuckled happily
3020,1743-142913-0002,he usually is one of the last of the flycatcher family to arrive i didn't expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early
3021,1743-142913-0003,it didn't take peter long to find pewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw pewee fly out and make the same kind of a little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies
3022,1743-142913-0004,it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone pee wee pee wee pee wee
3023,1743-142913-0005,but he wasn't sad as peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger than his cousin chebec but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail
3024,1743-142913-0006,the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing two whitish bars and he noticed that pewee's wings were longer than his tail which wasn't the case with chebec
3025,1743-142913-0007,but no one could ever mistake pewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over aren't you here early asked peter pewee nodded
3026,1743-142913-0008,that is something i don't often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call you wood pewee pewee chuckled happily
3027,1743-142913-0009,it is so quiet and restful that i love it missus pewee and i are very retiring we do not like too many near neighbors you won't mind if i come to see you once in a while will you asked peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch
3028,1743-142913-0010,come as often as you like replied pewee the oftener the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the flycatcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him
3029,1743-142913-0011,that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy
3030,1743-142913-0012,but most of all peter thought about that queer request of cresty's and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mister black snake
3031,1743-142913-0013,it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peter's curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mister sun had kicked his bedclothes off
3032,1743-142913-0014,jenny wren was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way and that way in that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldn't keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded
3033,1743-142913-0015,then as peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest said she why they want it goodness knows but
3034,1743-142913-0016,perhaps they think it will scare robbers away as for me i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that cresty and his wife are a handsome couple
3035,1743-142913-0017,and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugh by the way where does cresty build asked peter
3036,1743-142913-0018,in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite as surprised as he felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny wren
3037,1743-142913-0019,where are your eyes peter did you ever see a flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didn't wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look
3038,1743-142913-0020,there is downy the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute that's good i like to see that it means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses
3039,1743-142913-0021,i've noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesn't attract attention the way a new one does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind can't get in
3040,1743-142913-0022,the older it is the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us
3041,1743-142913-0023,winsome bluebird stupid snapped jenny wren peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and skimmer the tree swallow added jenny that's so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter
3042,1743-142913-0024,i've noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny wren nodded yank yank the nuthatch uses an old house i'm told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she
3043,1743-142913-0025,tommy tit the chickadee sometimes uses an old house then again he and missus chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one
3044,1743-142913-0026,then there are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl peter looked surprised i didn't suppose they nested in holes in trees he exclaimed they certainly do more's the pity snapped jenny
3045,1743-142913-0027,it would be a good thing for the rest of us if they didn't nest at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them killy always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year
3046,1743-142913-0028,spooky isn't particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine i've talked quite enough for one morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him
3047,1743-142913-0029,jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well what is it now she demanded have you got two homes asked peter goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny
3048,1743-142913-0030,one is all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mister wren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree it seems to me that he has carried enough in there to build two or three nests
3049,8238-274553-0000,i'll have none o them ned knowles the baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family every member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend
3050,8238-274553-0001,was more or less remarkable for talent of some description the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which tieck a scion of the house has given a vivid
3051,8238-274553-0002,threw a place in his regard and here with somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental conformation in later days this insight grew more clear
3052,8238-274553-0003,which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty fifth of june i remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the world
3053,8238-274553-0004,no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted
3054,8238-274553-0005,but letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university he began to exercise over the habits
3055,8238-274553-0006,manners persons purses and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable
3056,8238-274553-0007,that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung then of no particular age by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded
3057,8238-274553-0008,he might have been fifteen or fifty
3058,8238-274553-0009,he was by no means a handsome man perhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose a snub
3059,8238-274553-0010,after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most complex combination of human features conveying so entirely and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity
3060,8238-274553-0011,solemnity and repose it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found who make the science of mystification
3061,8238-274553-0012,the study and the business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue
3062,8238-274553-0013,i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the university with the exception of myself
3063,8238-274553-0014,ever suspected him to be capable of a joke verbal or practical the old bull dog at the garden gate would sooner have been accused the ghost of heraclitus or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology
3064,8238-274553-0015,this too when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him
3065,8238-274553-0016,lay in that consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature and a most wonderful self possession
3066,8238-274553-0017,in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater
3067,8238-274553-0018,which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions
3068,8238-274553-0019,the adroitness too was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created
3069,8238-274553-0020,from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual mystific escape
3070,8238-274553-0021,my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even his own household
3071,8238-274553-0022,with the memory of the baron ritzner von jung
3072,8238-274553-0023,lay like an incubus upon the university
3073,8238-274553-0024,during the greater part of the night had run wild upon the all engrossing topic of the times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening
3074,8238-274553-0025,and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor an eloquence
3075,8238-274553-0026,an impressiveness and an affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even myself who well knew him to be at heart
3076,8238-274553-0027,a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves
3077,8238-274553-0028,looking around me during a pause in the baron's discourse of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical sermonic manner of coleridge
3078,8238-274553-0029,except perhaps in the single particular that he was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a particular set at the university a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking
3079,8238-274553-0030,and i believe for some logical talent as a duellist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly
3080,8238-274553-0031,but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he rode to the death to ritzner
3081,8238-274553-0032,ever upon the lookout for the grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification of this however i was not aware
3082,8238-274553-0033,i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r and giving his reasons in detail
3083,8238-274553-0034,to these the baron replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with a sarcasm and a sneer
3084,8238-274553-0035,your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member
3085,8238-274553-0036,i would say sir that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman as hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were turned upon the baron
3086,8238-274553-0037,then excessively red then dropping his pocket handkerchief stooped to recover it when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be seen by no one else at the table
3087,8238-274553-0038,it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood erect
3088,8238-274553-0039,for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion and his face was cadaverously white
3089,8238-274553-0040,for a short time he remained silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood near him saying as he held it firmly clenched
3090,8238-274553-0041,the language you have thought proper to employ
3091,8238-274553-0042,in addressing yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman
3092,8238-274553-0043,is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct
3093,8238-274553-0044,you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to consider for an instant
3094,8238-274553-0045,this being done there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your insult
3095,8238-274553-0046,while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against the mirror which hung directly opposite hermann
3096,8238-274553-0047,striking the reflection of his person with great precision and of course shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once started to their feet and with the exception of myself and ritzner took their departure
3097,8238-274553-0048,as hermann went out the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business
3098,8238-274553-0049,and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar character
3099,8238-274553-0050,after a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello and entertained me for a long time
3100,8238-274553-0051,the theatre of honor by favyn
3101,8238-274553-0052,brantome's memoirs of duels published at cologne sixteen sixty six
3102,8238-274553-0053,with a fine margin and bound by derome
3103,8238-274553-0054,and having the quaint title duelli lex scripta et non
3104,8238-274553-0055,from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world
3105,8238-274553-0056,per constructionem
3106,8238-274553-0057,although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me having finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling
3107,8238-274553-0058,will hand you this note i find it incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an explanation of this evening's occurrences at your chambers in the event of your declining this request
3108,8238-274553-0059,having perused the cartel he wrote the following reply which i carried to hermann sir through our common friend mister p i have received your note of this evening
3109,8238-274553-0060,upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement
3110,8238-274553-0061,i have great reliance however on that extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette
3111,8238-274553-0062,the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient i am assured
3112,8238-274553-0063,to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your request as a man of honor for explanation with sentiments of profound respect your most obedient servant von jung
3113,8238-274553-0064,hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self complacency
3114,8238-274553-0065,et per se having finished reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in question turning to the passage specified he read it with great care to himself
3115,8238-274553-0066,to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron
3116,8238-274553-0067,he seemed to receive hermann's amicable letter as a matter of course and after a few words of general conversation went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duelli lex scripta et non
3117,8238-274553-0068,he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my surprise
3118,8238-274553-0069,he now explained the mystery
3119,8238-274553-0070,and even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately
3120,8238-274553-0071,when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in hermann's way
3121,8238-274553-0072,two or three weeks before the adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of his conversation
3122,8238-274553-0073,and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit upon this hint he proceeded
3123,8238-274553-0074,hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello
3124,8238-283452-0000,introduction the humorous ghost is distinctly a modern character in early literature wraiths took themselves very seriously
3125,8238-283452-0001,and insisted on a proper show of respectful fear on the part of those whom they honored by haunting a mortal was expected to rise when a ghost entered the room and in case he was slow about it
3126,8238-283452-0002,his spine gave notice of what etiquette demanded in the event of outdoor apparition if a man failed to bare his head in awe the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness
3127,8238-283452-0003,in that her locks being long and pinned up are less easily moved which may explain the fact if it be a fact that in fiction women have shown themselves more self possessed
3128,8238-283452-0004,while the feminine can be seen through by another woman and thus disarmed the majority of the comic apparitions curiously enough are masculine you don't often find women wraithed in smiles
3129,8238-283452-0005,and have chivalrously spared the gentler shades and there are very few funny child ghosts you might almost say none in comparison with the number of grown ups
3130,8238-283452-0006,the number of ghost children of any or all types is small proportionately perhaps because it seems an unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances
3131,8238-283452-0007,there are a few instances as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later but very few ancient ghosts were a long faced lot
3132,8238-283452-0008,since any living person however senile would be thought juvenile compared with a timeless spook but in these days of individualism and radical liberalism spooks as well as mortals are expanding their personalities
3133,8238-283452-0009,and indulging in greater freedom a ghost can call his shade his own now and exhibit any mood he pleases even young female wraiths demanding latchkeys refuse to obey the frowning face of the clock
3134,8238-283452-0010,to make the ghost of missus grundy turn a shade paler in horror nowadays haunters have more fun and freedom than the haunted in fact it's money in one's pocket these days to be dead for ghosts have no rent problems
3135,8238-283452-0011,manifestly death has compensations not connected with the consolations of religion the marvel is that apparitions were so long in realizing their possibilities in improving their advantages
3136,8238-283452-0012,the specters in classic and medieval literature were malarial vaporous beings without energy to do anything but threaten
3137,8238-283452-0013,at best a revenant could only rattle a rusty skeleton or shake a moldy shroud or clank a chain but as mortals cowered before his demonstrations he didn't worry
3138,8238-283452-0014,the up to date ghost keeps his skeleton in a garage or some place where it is cleaned and oiled and kept in good working order the modern wraith has sold his sheet to the old clo'es man and dresses as in life
3139,8238-283452-0015,he knows that there's no weapon no threat in horror to be compared with ridicule think what a solemn creature the gothic ghost was
3140,8238-283452-0016,how little originality and initiative he showed and how dependent he was on his own atmosphere for thrills his sole appeal was to the spinal column the ghost of to day touches the funny bone as well
3141,8238-283452-0017,many americans there are to day who would court being haunted by the captain and crew of richard middleton's ghost ship that landed in a turnip field and dispensed drink till they demoralized the denizens of village and graveyard alike
3142,8238-283452-0018,after that show of spirits the turnips in that field tasted of rum long after the ghost ship had sailed away into the blue the modern spook is possessed not only of humor but of a caustic satire as well
3143,8238-283452-0019,his jest is likely to have more than one point to it and he can haunt so insidiously can make himself so at home in his host's study or bedroom that a man actually welcomes a chat with him
3144,8238-283452-0020,a ghost moreover that towered and swelled at every hackneyed phrase till finally he filled the room and burst after the young man proposed to his admired one and made subsequent remarks
3145,8238-283452-0021,ghosts not only have appallingly long memories but they possess a mean advantage over the living in that they have once been mortal
3146,8238-283452-0022,the modern humorous ghost satirizes everything from the old fashioned specter he's very fond of taking pot shots at him to the latest psychic manifestations
3147,8238-283452-0023,he laughs at ghosts that aren't experts in efficiency haunting and he has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of specters he loves to shake the lugubrious terrors of the past before you
3148,8238-283452-0024,and uses the old thrills only to show what dead batteries they come from his really electrical effects are his own inventions he needs no dungeon keeps and monkish cells to play about in not he
3149,8238-283452-0025,he demands no rag nor bone nor clank of chain of his old equipment to start on his career he can start up a moving picture show of his own as in ruth mc enery stuart's the haunted photograph
3150,8238-283452-0026,and demonstrate a new kind of apparition the ghost story of to day gives you spinal sensations with a difference as in the immortal transferred ghost by frank r stockton
3151,8238-283452-0027,where the suitor on the moonlit porch attempting to tell his fair one that he dotes on her sees the ghost of her ferocious uncle who isn't dead
3152,8238-283452-0028,kicking his heels against the railing and hears his admonition that he'd better hurry up as the live uncle is coming in sight
3153,8238-283452-0029,has never been a ghost nor used a wooden leg but a terrifying leg acy while you do believe in it the new ghost has a more nimble and versatile tongue as well as wit
3154,8238-283452-0030,in the older fiction and drama apparitions spoke seldom
3155,8238-283452-0031,and ghosts like kings in drama were of a dignity and must preserve it in their speech or perhaps the authors were doubtful as to the dialogue of shades
3156,8238-283452-0032,and compromised on a few stately ejaculations as being safely phantasmal speaking parts but compare that usage with the rude freedom of some modern spooks
3157,8238-283452-0033,think of having always and always to speak a dead language the humorous ghost is not only modern but he is distinctively american there are ghosts of all nationalities naturally
3158,8238-283452-0034,but the spook that provides a joke on his host or on himself is yankee in origin and development the dry humor the comic sense of the incongruous the willingness to laugh at himself as at others
3159,8238-283452-0035,and are preserved in their true flavor i don't assert of course
3160,8238-283452-0036,the french and english selections in this volume are sufficient to prove the contrary
3161,8238-283452-0037,there are various english stories of whimsical haunting some of actual spooks and some of the hoax type hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in british as in american literature
3162,8238-283452-0038,of the early specimens of the really amusing ghost that is an actual revenant is the ghost baby in blackwood's which shows originality and humor yet is too diffuse for printing here
3163,8238-283452-0039,in that we have a conventional young bachelor engaged to a charming girl who is entangled in social complications and made to suffer mental torment because without his consent
3164,8238-283452-0040,till the phantom couple take a liking to each other and decide to let the living bury their dead this is suggestive of brander matthews's earlier and cleverer story of a spectral courtship in the rival ghosts
3165,8238-283452-0041,medieval and later literature gave us many instances of a love affair or marriage between one spirit and one mortal
3166,8238-283452-0042,show the diversity of the english humor as associated with apparitions and are entertaining in themselves the canterville ghost by oscar wilde is one of his best short stories
3167,8238-283452-0043,this travesty on the conventional traditions of the wraith is preposterously delightful one of the cleverest ghost stories in our language zangwill has written engagingly of spooks
3168,8238-283452-0044,frank r stockton gave his to funny spooks with a riotous and laughing pen the spirit in his transferred ghost is impudently deathless and has called up a train of subsequent haunters
3169,8238-283452-0045,john kendrick bangs has made the darker regions seem comfortable and homelike for us and has created ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward to being one or more
3170,8238-283452-0046,we feel downright neighborly toward such specters as the futile last ghost nelson lloyd evokes for us as we appreciate the satire of rose o'neill's sophisticated wraith
3171,8238-283452-0047,the field is still comparatively limited but a number of americans have done distinctive work in it the specter now wears motley instead of a shroud
3172,5456-62014-0000,the woman who married an owl by anne virginia culbertson when the children got home from the nutting expedition and had eaten supper they sat around discontentedly wishing every few minutes that their mother had returned i wish mamma would come back

3184,5456-62014-0012,here the old woman rose and threw on a handful of lightwood which blazed up with a great sputtering and in the strong light she stood before the fire enacting the part of the scared owl for the delighted yet half startled children
3185,5456-62014-0013,de fire blaze an spit an sputter jes lak dis do an de ooman she fotched a yell an cried out she did lan er de mussiful
3186,5456-62014-0014,an de wimmins dey let out a turr'ble screech kase dey seed twa'n't nuttin but a big owl settin dar blinkin
3187,5456-62014-0015,o o goo coo o o goo coo ez he flewed off inter de darkness here aunt phrony spread her arms like wings and made a swoop half way across the room to the bedside of the startled children an she continued
3188,5456-62014-0016,de wind howl mo'nful all night long an seem ter de gal an her mammy
3189,5456-62014-0017,and didn't he ever come back said ned naw suh dat he didn he wuz too shame ter come back an he bin so shame er de trick uver sence dat he hide hisse'f way in de daytime an nuver come out twel de dusk
3190,5456-62014-0018,he teck dat time too
3191,5456-24741-0000,the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies
3192,5456-24741-0001,proof all the modes in which any given body is affected
3193,5456-24741-0002,wherefore their idea also necessarily
3194,5456-24741-0003,therefore the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body
3195,5456-24741-0004,hence it follows first that the human mind perceives the nature of a variety of bodies together with the nature of its own
3196,5456-24741-0005,it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing
3197,5456-24741-0006,in other words it will have the idea which does not exclude but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body
3198,5456-24741-0007,will regard the external body as actually existing
3199,5456-24741-0008,corollary the mind is able to regard as present external bodies by which the human body has once been affected even though they be no longer in existence or present
3200,5456-24741-0009,by which the human body has once been affected be no longer in existence the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated
3201,5456-24741-0010,note we thus see how it comes about
3202,5456-24741-0011,the latter indicates rather the disposition of paul's body than the nature of peter and therefore while this disposition of paul's body lasts paul's mind will regard peter as present to itself even though he no longer exists further to retain the usual phraseology
3203,5456-24741-0012,the modifications of the human body of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us we will call the images of things though they do not recall the figure of things when the mind regards bodies in this fashion we say that it imagines
3204,5456-24741-0013,looked at in themselves do not contain error the mind does not err in the mere act of imagining but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea
3205,5456-24741-0014,which association arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications affectiones of the human body i say first it is an association of those ideas only
3206,5456-24741-0015,ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking
3207,5456-24741-0016,those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies i say secondly
3208,5456-24741-0017,in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas
3209,5456-24741-0018,whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes
3210,5456-24741-0019,and hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of one thing should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum an apple
3211,5456-24741-0020,a roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it
3212,5456-24741-0021,that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit
3213,5456-24741-0022,or the human mind perceives those modifications
3214,5456-24741-0023,the human body itself and as actually existing therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body
3215,5456-24741-0024,following in god in the same manner and being referred to god in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the human body proof
3216,5456-62043-0000,a bully boat and a brag captain a story of steamboat life on the mississippi by sol smith does any one remember the caravan she was what would now be considered a slow boat then eighteen twenty seven
3217,5456-62043-0001,she was regularly advertised as the fast running et cetera her regular trips from new orleans to natchez were usually made in from six to eight days a trip made by her in five days was considered remarkable
3218,5456-62043-0002,a voyage from new orleans to vicksburg and back including stoppages generally entitled the officers and crew to a month's wages whether the caravan ever achieved the feat of a voyage to the falls louisville i have never learned if she did
3219,5456-62043-0003,she must have had a time of it it was my fate to take passage in this boat the captain was a good natured easy going man careful of the comfort of his passengers and exceedingly fond of the game of brag we had been out a little more than five days
3220,5456-62043-0004,and we were in hopes of seeing the bluffs of natchez on the next day our wood was getting low and night coming on the pilot on duty above the other pilot held three aces at the time and was just calling out the captain who went it strong on three kings
3221,5456-62043-0005,sent down word that the mate had reported the stock of wood reduced to half a cord the worthy captain excused himself to the pilot whose watch was below and the two passengers who made up the party and hurried to the deck
3222,5456-62043-0006,which he said was situated right round yonder point but muttered the captain i don't much like to take wood of the yellow faced old scoundrel who owns it he always charges a quarter of a dollar more than any one else however there's no other chance
3223,5456-62043-0007,and in a little less than an hour when our fuel was about giving out we made the point and our cables were out and fastened to trees alongside of a good sized wood pile hallo colonel how d'ye sell your wood this time a yellow faced old gentleman
3224,5456-62043-0008,with a two weeks beard strings over his shoulders holding up to his armpits a pair of copperas colored linsey woolsey pants the legs of which reached a very little below the knee shoes without stockings a faded broad brimmed hat which had once been black
3225,5456-62043-0009,and a pipe in his mouth casting a glance at the empty guards of our boat and uttering a grunt as he rose from fastening our spring line answered why capting we must charge you three and a quarter this time the d l replied the captain
3226,5456-62043-0010,what's the odd quarter for i should like to know you only charged me three as i went down why captaing drawled out the wood merchant with a sort of leer on his yellow countenance which clearly indicated that his wood was as good as sold
3227,5456-62043-0011,wood's riz since you went down two weeks ago besides you are awar that you very seldom stop going down
3228,5456-62043-0012,and there's no other woodyard for nine miles ahead and if you happen to be nearly out of fooel why well well interrupted the captain we'll take a few cords under the circumstances and he returned to his game of brag
3229,5456-62043-0013,in about half an hour we felt the caravan commence paddling again supper was over
3230,5456-62043-0014,situated alongside and overlooking the brag table where the captain was deeply engaged having now the other pilot as his principal opponent we jogged on quietly and seemed to be going at a good rate
3231,5456-62043-0015,how does that wood burn inquired the captain of the mate who was looking on at the game tisn't of much account i reckon answered the mate it's cottonwood and most of it green at that well thompson three aces again stranger
3232,5456-62043-0016,thompson i say we'd better take three or four cords at the next woodyard it can't be more than six miles from here two aces and a bragger with the age
3233,5456-62043-0017,the game went on and the paddles kept moving at eleven o'clock it was reported to the captain that we were nearing the woodyard the light being distinctly seen by the pilot on duty head her in shore then and take in six cords if it's good see to it thompson
3234,5456-62043-0018,i can't very well leave the game now it's getting right warm this pilot's beating us all to smash the wooding completed we paddled on again the captain seemed somewhat vexed when the mate informed him that the price was the same as at the last woodyard
3235,5456-62043-0019,three and a quarter but soon again became interested in the game from my upper berth there were no state rooms then i could observe the movements of the players
3236,5456-62043-0020,the latter personages took it turn and turn about steering and playing brag one of them almost invariably winning while the two passengers merely went through the ceremony of dealing cutting and paying up their anties they were anxious to learn the game
3237,5456-62043-0021,and they did learn it once in a while indeed seeing they had two aces and a bragger they would venture a bet of five or ten dollars but they were always compelled to back out before the tremendous bragging of the captain or pilot
3238,5456-62043-0022,or if they did venture to call out on two bullits and a bragger they had the mortification to find one of the officers had the same kind of a hand and were more venerable still with all these disadvantages they continued playing
3239,5456-62043-0023,they wanted to learn the game at two o'clock the captain asked the mate how we were getting on oh pretty glibly sir replied the mate we can scarcely tell what headway we are making for we are obliged to keep the middle of the river and there is the shadow of a fog rising
3240,5456-62043-0024,this wood seems rather better than that we took in at yellow face's but we're nearly out again and must be looking out for more i saw a light just ahead on the right shall we hail yes yes replied the captain ring the bell and ask em what's the price of wood up here i've got you again
3241,5456-62043-0025,i heard the bell and the pilot's hail what's your price for wood a youthful voice on the shore answered three and a quarter d net ejaculated the captain
3242,5456-62043-0026,the strangers suffering some at the same time three and a quarter again are we never to get to a cheaper country deal sir if you please better luck next time the other pilot's voice was again heard on deck how much have you only about ten cords sir
3243,5456-62043-0027,was the reply of the youthful salesman the captain here told thompson to take six cords which would last till daylight and again turned his attention to the game the pilots here changed places when did they sleep wood taken in
3244,5456-62043-0028,the caravan again took her place in the middle of the stream paddling on as usual day at length dawned the brag party broke up and settlements were being made during which operation
3245,5456-62043-0029,the captain's bragging propensities were exercised in cracking up the speed of his boat which by his reckoning
3246,5456-62043-0030,it appears the two passengers in their first lesson had incidentally lost one hundred and twenty dollars the captain as he rose to see about taking in some good wood which he felt sure of obtaining now that he had got above the level country winked at his opponent
3247,5456-62043-0031,the pilot with whom he had been on very bad terms during the progress of the game and said in an undertone forty apiece for you and i and james the other pilot is not bad for one night i had risen and went out with the captain to enjoy a view of the bluffs
3248,5456-62043-0032,there was just fog enough to prevent the vision taking in more than sixty yards so i was disappointed in my expectation we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood the banks being invisible from the middle of the river there it is exclaimed the captain stop her
3249,5456-62043-0033,and the captain hailed hallo the woodyard hallo yourself answered a squeaking female voice which came from a woman with a petticoat over her shoulders in place of a shawl what's the price of wood
3250,5456-62043-0034,i think you ought to know the price by this time answered the old lady in the petticoat
3251,5456-62043-0035,and now you know it three and the d l broke in the captain what have you raised on your wood too i'll give you three and not a cent more well replied the petticoat here comes the old man he'll talk to you and sure enough
3252,5456-62043-0036,out crept from the cottage the veritable faded hat copperas colored pants yellow countenance and two weeks beard we had seen the night before
3253,5456-62043-0037,accompanied by the same leer of the same yellow countenance why darn it all capting there is but three or four cords left and since it's you i don't care if i do let you have it for three as you're a good customer
3254,5456-62043-0038,and turned in to take some rest the fact became apparent the reader will probably have discovered it some time since
3255,5456-58161-0000,the diamond wedding by edmund clarence stedman o love love love what times were those long ere the age of belles and beaux and brussels lace and silken hose when in the green arcadian close
3256,5456-58161-0001,you married psyche under the rose with only the grass for bedding heart to heart and hand to hand you followed nature's sweet command roaming lovingly through the land nor sighed for a diamond wedding
3257,5456-58161-0002,so have we read in classic ovid how hero watched for her beloved impassioned youth leander she was the fairest of the fair
3258,5456-58161-0003,for love was love and better than money the slyer the theft the sweeter the honey and kissing was clover all the world over wherever cupid might wander so thousands of years have come and gone and still the moon is shining on still hymen's torch is lighted
3259,5456-58161-0004,and hitherto in this land of the west most couples in love have thought it best to follow the ancient way of the rest
3260,5456-58161-0005,in a style i can not hope to attain and covered himself with glory how it befell one summer's day the king of the cubans strolled this way king january's his name they say and fell in love with the princess may the reigning belle of manhattan
3261,5456-58161-0006,nor how he began to smirk and sue and dress as lovers who come to woo or as max maretzek and julien do when they sit full bloomed in the ladies view and flourish the wondrous baton he wasn't one of your polish nobles
3262,5456-58161-0007,whose presence their country somehow troubles and so our cities receive them nor one of your make believe spanish grandees who ply our daughters with lies and candies until the poor girls believe them no he was no such charlatan count de hoboken flash in the pan
3263,5456-58161-0008,full of gasconade and bravado but a regular rich don rataplan santa claus de la muscovado senor grandissimo bastinado
3264,5456-58161-0009,his was the rental of half havana and all matanzas and santa anna rich as he was could hardly hold a candle to light the mines of gold our cuban owned choke full of diggers and broad plantations that in round figures were stocked with at least five thousand niggers
3265,5456-58161-0010,gather ye rosebuds while ye may the senor swore to carry the day to capture the beautiful princess may with his battery of treasure velvet and lace she should not lack
3266,5456-58161-0011,and come and go at her pleasure jet and lava silver and gold garnets emeralds rare to behold diamonds sapphires wealth untold
3267,5456-58161-0012,kept bidding a little higher and every time he made his bid and what she said and all they did twas written down for the good of the town by jeems of the daily flyer a coach and horses you'd think would buy for the don an easy victory
3268,5456-58161-0013,but slowly our princess yielded a diamond necklace caught her eye
3269,5456-58161-0014,she stood such a fire of silks and laces jewels and gold dressing cases and ruby brooches and jets and pearls that every one of her dainty curls brought the price of a hundred common girls folks thought the lass demented
3270,5456-58161-0015,an infant kohinoor did the thing and sighing with love or something the same what's in a name the princess may consented
3271,5456-58161-0016,let the gaunt and hungry and ragged poor throng round the great cathedral door to wonder what all the hubbub's for and sometimes stupidly wonder at so much sunshine and brightness which fall from the church upon the rich while the poor get all the thunder
3272,5456-58161-0017,ring ring merry bells ring o fortunate few with letters blue good for a seat and a nearer view fortunate few whom i dare not name dilettanti creme de la creme
3273,5456-58161-0018,we commoners stood by the street facade and caught a glimpse of the cavalcade
3274,5456-58161-0019,six lustrous maidens in tarletan she led the van of the caravan
3275,5456-58161-0020,that told as plainly as words could speak she was more antique than the other leaned on the arm of don rataplan santa claus de la muscovado senor grandissimo bastinado happy mortal fortunate man and marquis of el dorado
3276,5456-58161-0021,in they swept all riches and grace silks and satins jewels and lace in they swept from the dazzled sun and soon in the church the deed was done three prelates stood on the chancel high
3277,5456-58161-0022,a knot that gold and silver can buy gold and silver may yet untie unless it is tightly fastened what's worth doing at all's worth doing well and the sale of a young manhattan belle is not to be pushed or hastened
3278,5456-58161-0023,so two very reverends graced the scene and the tall archbishop stood between by prayer and fasting chastened the pope himself would have come from rome but garibaldi kept him at home haply those robed prelates thought their words were the power that tied the knot
3279,5456-58161-0024,but another power that love knot tied and i saw the chain round the neck of the bride a glistening priceless marvelous chain coiled with diamonds again and again as befits a diamond wedding yet still twas a chain and i thought she knew it
3280,5456-58161-0025,and half way longed for the will to undo it by the secret tears she was shedding but isn't it odd to think whenever we all go through that terrible river whose sluggish tide alone can sever the archbishop says
3281,5456-58161-0026,the church decree by floating one into eternity and leaving the other alive as ever as each wades through that ghastly stream the satins that rustle and gems that gleam will grow pale and heavy and sink away to the noisome river's bottom clay
3282,5456-58161-0027,will shiver upon the banks of the styx quite as helpless as they were born naked souls and very forlorn the princess then must shift for herself and lay her royalty on the shelf she and the beautiful empress yonder whose robes are now the wide world's wonder
3283,5456-58161-0028,who calico wear each morn of their lives and the sewing girls and les chiffonniers in rags and hunger a gaunt array and all the grooms of the caravan
3284,1088-134315-0000,as you know and as i have given you proof i have the greatest admiration in the world for one whose work for humanity has won such universal recognition i hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person
3285,1088-134315-0001,the apologies which are due to you i feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your esteem nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self respect i am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man george gathercole
3286,1088-134315-0002,to disturb a relationship which i have always hoped would be mutually pleasant if you will allow gathercole who will be unconscious of the part he is playing to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself
3287,1088-134315-0003,i shall feel that his trip which has cost me a large sum of money will not have been wasted i am dear mister meredith yours very sincerely remington kara
3288,1088-134315-0004,kara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope he rang a bell on his table and the girl who had so filled t x with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room you will see that this is delivered miss holland
3289,1088-134315-0005,a man against whom my favourite weapon would fail she looked at him with interest in her eyes what is your favourite weapon mister kara she asked fear he said
3290,1088-134315-0006,if he expected her to give him any encouragement to proceed he was disappointed probably he required no such encouragement for in the presence of his social inferiors he was somewhat monopolizing cut a man's flesh and it heals he said
3291,1088-134315-0007,whip a man and the memory of it passes frighten him fill him with a sense of foreboding and apprehension and let him believe that something dreadful is going to happen either to himself or to someone he loves better the latter
3292,1088-134315-0008,and you will hurt him beyond forgetfulness fear is a tyrant and a despot more terrible than the rack more potent than the stake fear is many eyed and sees horrors where normal vision only sees the ridiculous
3293,1088-134315-0009,is that your creed she asked quietly part of it miss holland he smiled she played idly with the letter she held in her hand balancing it on the edge of the desk her eyes downcast
3294,1088-134315-0010,what would justify the use of such an awful weapon she asked it is amply justified to secure an end he said blandly for example i want something i cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means
3295,1088-134315-0011,if i can buy it well and good if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me so much the better if i can obtain it by any merit i possess i utilize that merit
3296,1088-134315-0012,providing always that i can secure my object in the time otherwise he shrugged his shoulders i see she said nodding her head quickly i suppose that is how blackmailers feel he frowned
3297,1088-134315-0013,that is a word i never use nor do i like to hear it employed he said blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money
3298,1088-134315-0014,and according to your argument they are also justified it is a matter of plane he said airily viewed from my standpoint they are sordid criminals the sort of person that t x meets i presume in the course of his daily work
3299,1088-134315-0015,t x he went on somewhat oracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
3300,1088-134315-0016,he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person said the girl coldly i am paying you three pounds a week i think he said
3301,1088-134315-0017,i intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably thank you said the girl quietly but i am already being paid quite sufficient she left him a little astonished and not a little ruffled
3302,1088-134315-0018,to refuse the favours of remington kara was by him regarded as something of an affront
3303,1088-134315-0019,he rang the bell this time for his valet fisher he said i am expecting a visit from a gentleman named gathercole a one armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes
3304,1088-134315-0020,detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him
3305,1088-134315-0021,he will probably be interested if you take him into the library very good sir said the urbane fisher will you change before you go out kara shook his head i think i will go as i am he said get me my fur coat this beastly cold kills me
3306,1088-134315-0022,he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street keep my fire going put all my private letters in my bedroom and see that miss holland has her lunch fisher followed him to his car wrapped the fur rug about his legs
3307,1088-134315-0023,closed the door carefully and returned to the house
3308,1088-134315-0024,that he should return to kara's study and set the papers in order was natural and proper that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers in kara's desk might be excused on the score of diligence since he was to some extent in the confidence of his employer
3309,1088-134315-0025,kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point in his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as fred and on more occasions than one and for no apparent reason had tipped his servant over and above his salary
3310,1088-134315-0026,mister fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon kara's cheque book which told him that on the previous day the greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank
3311,1088-134315-0027,this interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of kara's correspondence
3312,1088-134315-0028,answering letters appealing for charitable donations and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great he replenished the fire asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest
3313,1088-134315-0029,this time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations the safe he did not attempt to touch but there was a small bureau in which kara would have placed his private correspondence of the morning this however yielded no result
3314,1088-134315-0030,rum cove said fisher he paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework he lifted it gingerly
3315,1088-134315-0031,there was a little knob for the purpose and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself rum cove he said again and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up left the room closing the door softly behind him
3316,1088-134315-0032,he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown and began to descend the stairs to the hall he was less than half way down when the one maid of kara's household came up to meet him there's a gentleman who wants to see mister kara she said here is his card
3317,1088-134315-0033,fisher took the card from the salver and read mister george gathercole junior travellers club i'll see this gentleman he said with a sudden brisk interest he found the visitor standing in the hall
3318,1088-134315-0034,he was a man who would have attracted attention if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance he was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check he had a top hat glossy and obviously new at the back of his head
3319,1088-134315-0035,a pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture fisher who was an observer of some discernment noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit large black boots
3320,1088-134315-0036,and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
3321,1088-134315-0037,either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand accidentally the valet's hand pressed against the other's sleeve and he received a shock for the forearm was clearly an artificial one it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck
3322,1088-134315-0038,and this view of the stranger's infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat where is kara growled the stranger
3323,1088-134315-0039,he told me he would be in at six o'clock at the latest six o'clock ye gods stormed the man impatiently what dog am i that i should wait till six
3324,1088-134315-0040,six o'clock eh you will tell mister kara that i called give me those books but i assure you sir stammered fisher give me those books roared the other
3325,1088-134315-0041,deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket crooked the elbow by some quick manipulation and thrust the books which the valet most reluctantly handed to him back to the place from whence he had taken them tell mister kara i will call at my own time
3326,1088-134315-0042,good morning to you if you would only wait sir pleaded the agonized fisher wait be hanged snarled the other i've waited three years i tell you tell mister kara to expect me when he sees me he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him
3327,1088-134315-0043,fisher went back to the library the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up i am afraid miss holland i've got myself into very serious trouble what is that fisher asked the girl
3328,1088-134315-0044,mister gathercole said the girl quickly fisher nodded yes miss i couldn't get him to stay though she pursed her lips thoughtfully mister kara will be very cross but i don't see how you can help it i wish you had called me
3329,1088-134315-0045,at six o'clock miss the man replied there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered shall i ring up for a messenger no i don't think that would be advisable you had better take it yourself
3330,1088-134315-0046,she handed him the letter and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription
3331,1088-134315-0047,special service department scotland yard whitehall he put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change large as the house was kara did not employ a regular staff of servants a maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff
3332,1088-134315-0048,the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid serving maid and housekeeper in one miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon
3333,1088-134315-0049,but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her she heard the soft thud of the front door closing and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street she watched fisher until he was out of sight
3334,1088-134315-0050,the maid who was also cook arose up as the girl entered it's a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen miss she smiled i'm afraid you're rather lonely missus beale said the girl sympathetically lonely miss cried the maid
3335,1088-134315-0051,i fairly get the creeps sitting here hour after hour it's that door that gives me the hump she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood that's mister kara's wine cellar nobody's been in it but him
3336,1088-134315-0052,i know he goes in sometimes because i tried a dodge that my brother who's a policeman taught me i stretched a bit of white cotton across it an it was broke the next morning mister kara keeps some of his private papers in there said the girl quietly he has told me so himself
3337,1088-134315-0053,said the woman doubtfully i wish he'd brick it up the same as he has the lower cellar i get the horrors sittin here at night expectin the door to open an the ghost of the mad lord to come out him that was killed in africa miss holland laughed i want you to go out now she said
3338,1088-134315-0054,the girl ascended to the upper floor again she watched from the window the disappearing figure once out of sight miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness from her bag she produced a small purse and opened it
3339,1088-134315-0055,in that case was a new steel key
3340,1088-134315-0056,in two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents it was a large safe of the usual type there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box
3341,1088-134315-0057,an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected she returned the papers to the drawer pushed it to and locked it she gave her attention to the second drawer her hand shook a little as she pulled it open
3342,1088-134315-0058,it was a square case covered in red morocco leather she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry at last she said aloud and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face
3343,1088-134318-0000,chapter twelve kara lay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
3344,1088-134318-0001,it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasant's cabin on the hillside outside durazzo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at kara's whim all that life held for a man
3345,1088-134318-0002,to the hateful eyes of the girl's father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
3346,1088-134318-0003,to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
3347,1088-134318-0004,he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
3348,1088-134318-0005,he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pezara and
3349,1088-134318-0006,had t x returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions
3350,1088-134318-0007,kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
3351,1088-134318-0008,yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that night's freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven o'clock
3352,1088-134318-0009,bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway
3353,1088-134318-0010,muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher that's very good of him
3354,1088-134318-0011,yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
3355,1088-134318-0012,yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldn't think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldn't sneered the visitor
3356,1088-134318-0013,then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
3357,1088-134318-0014,he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
3358,1088-134318-0015,fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
3359,1088-134318-0016,no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
3360,1088-134318-0017,and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial i suppose your cheque will be honoured all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
3361,1088-134318-0018,damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
3362,1088-134318-0019,always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money don't you believe it don't you believe it my poor man said the other you
3363,1088-134318-0020,at that moment there came from kara's room a faint clang what's that asked the visitor a little startled mister kara's put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
3364,1088-134318-0021,until eleven o'clock at any rate he's a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
3365,1088-129236-0000,every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments each of its joys ripens into a new want nature uncontainable flowing forelooking
3366,1088-129236-0001,in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light the introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one which is the enchantment of human life
3367,1088-129236-0002,unites him to his race pledges him to the domestic and civic relations carries him with new sympathy into nature enhances the power of the senses opens the imagination adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes
3368,1088-129236-0003,establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society the natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience
3369,1088-129236-0004,one must not be too old the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom
3370,1088-129236-0005,and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable censors i shall appeal to my seniors
3371,1088-129236-0006,for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old
3372,1088-129236-0007,glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women upon the universal heart of all and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames
3373,1088-129236-0008,only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden
3374,1088-129236-0009,and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured
3375,1088-129236-0010,which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name
3376,1088-129236-0011,dwell care and canker and fear with thought with the ideal is immortal hilarity the rose of joy round it all the muses sing but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of to day and yesterday
3377,1088-129236-0012,the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment
3378,1088-129236-0013,and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life like any passage betraying affection between two parties perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion and we are no longer strangers
3379,1088-129236-0014,it is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic the rude village boy teases the girls about the school house door but to day he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel
3380,1088-129236-0015,he holds her books to help her and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough but one alone distances him
3381,1088-129236-0016,for persons are love's world and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature aught derogatory to the social instincts
3382,1088-129236-0017,yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience
3383,1088-129236-0018,that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances
3384,1088-129236-0019,no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain which created all things anew which was the dawn in him of music poetry and art which made the face of nature radiant with purple light
3385,1088-129236-0020,the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory
3386,1088-129236-0021,when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends though best and purest can give him for the figures the motions
3387,1088-129236-0022,the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enamelled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone where'er thou art
3388,1088-129236-0023,thy loving heart in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love
3389,1088-129236-0024,all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on
3390,1088-129236-0025,the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes
3391,1088-129236-0026,a midnight bell a passing groan these are the sounds we feed upon behold there in the wood the fine madman he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights he dilates he is twice a man
3392,1088-129236-0027,he walks with arms akimbo he soliloquizes he accosts the grass and the trees he feels the blood of the violet the clover and the lily in his veins and he talks with the brook that wets his foot
3393,1088-129236-0028,the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion who cannot write well under any other circumstances
3394,1088-129236-0029,the like force has the passion over all his nature it expands the sentiment it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart
3395,1088-129236-0030,into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world so only it have the countenance of the beloved object in giving him to another it still more gives him to himself
3396,3240-131232-0000,then i think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of mississippi weeks or months before may eleventh eighteen ninety four no i don't look for it and inevitably find it or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up indefinitely
3397,3240-131232-0001,but may after a while be shaken down by storms
3398,3240-131232-0002,so then that the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different origins from different worlds perhaps have entered a region of suspension over this earth wafting near each other long duration
3399,3240-131232-0003,final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance with hail or that hailstones too when large are phenomena of suspension of long duration that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could become so great only in falling from the clouds
3400,3240-131232-0004,long duration other indications of long duration i think of a region somewhere above this earth's surface in which gravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the distance
3401,3240-131232-0005,quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from a magnet theoretically the attraction of a magnet should decrease with the square of the distance but the falling off is found to be almost abrupt at a short distance
3402,3240-131232-0006,horses and barns and elephants and flies and dodoes moas and pterodactyls leaves from modern trees and leaves of the carboniferous era all however tending to disintegrate into homogeneous looking muds or dusts
3403,3240-131232-0007,red or black or yellow treasure troves for the palaeontologists and for the archaeologists accumulations of centuries cyclones of egypt greece and assyria fishes dried and hard there a short time others there long enough to putrefy
3404,3240-131232-0008,but the omnipresence of heterogeneity or living fishes also ponds of fresh water oceans of salt water as to the law of gravitation i prefer to take one simple stand
3405,3240-131232-0009,orthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces gravitation is one of these forces all other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness irrespective of distance as well as of attraction
3406,3240-131232-0010,but newtonian gravitation admits attraction only then newtonian gravitation can be only one third acceptable even to the orthodox or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of forces or still simpler here are the data
3407,3240-131232-0011,though it harmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary source and of course with other data too is inadequate to account for two peculiarities of the falls of frogs that never has a fall of tadpoles been reported
3408,3240-131232-0012,that never has a fall of full grown frogs been reported always frogs a few months old it sounds positive but if there be such reports they are somewhere out of my range of reading but tadpoles would be more likely to fall from the sky than would frogs
3409,3240-131232-0013,little or big if such falls be attributed to whirlwinds and more likely to fall from the super sargasso sea if though very tentatively and provisionally we accept the super sargasso sea
3410,3240-131232-0014,before we take up an especial expression upon the fall of immature and larval forms of life to this earth and the necessity then of conceiving of some factor besides mere stationariness or suspension or stagnation
3411,3240-131232-0015,there are other data that are similar to data of falls of fishes science gossip
3412,3240-131232-0016,that small snails of a land species had fallen near redruth cornwall july eighth eighteen eighty six during a heavy thunderstorm roads and fields strewn with them so that they were gathered up by the hatful
3413,3240-131232-0017,none seen to fall by the writer of this account snails said to be quite different to any previously known in this district
3414,3240-131232-0018,of great and deserved repute i thought i should for once like to trace the origin of one of these fabulous tales our own acceptance is that justice cannot be in an intermediate existence
3415,3240-131232-0019,in which there can be approximation only to justice or to injustice that to be fair is to have no opinion at all that to be honest is to be uninterested that to investigate is to admit prejudice that nobody has ever really investigated anything
3416,3240-131232-0020,but has always sought positively to prove or to disprove something that was conceived of or suspected in advance as i suspected says this correspondent i found that the snails were of a familiar land species that they had been upon the ground
3417,3240-131232-0021,in the first place he found that the snails had appeared after the rain that astonished rustics had jumped to the conclusion that they had fallen he met one person who said that he had seen the snails fall this was his error says the investigator
3418,3240-131232-0022,in such quantities that they were shoveled up it is said that the snails may be considered as a local species
3419,3240-131232-0023,and that in his opinion they had been upon the ground in the first place but that there had been some unusual condition aloft comes out in his observation upon the curious azure blue appearance of the sun at the time
3420,3240-131232-0024,that according to das wetter december eighteen ninety two upon august ninth eighteen ninety two a yellow cloud appeared over paderborn germany from this cloud fell a torrential rain in which were hundreds of mussels
3421,3240-131232-0025,there is no mention of whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place nor of a whirlwind lizards
3422,3240-131232-0026,that during a heavy shower july third eighteen sixty he heard a peculiar sound at his feet and looking down saw a snake lying as if stunned by a fall it then came to life gray snake about a foot long
3423,3240-131232-0027,these data have any meaning or lack of meaning or degree of damnation you please but in the matter of the fall that occurred at memphis tennessee occur some strong significances
3424,3240-131232-0028,our quasi reasoning upon this subject applies to all segregations so far considered monthly weather review january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven that
3425,3240-131232-0029,rather strictly localized or in a space of two blocks and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found they were crawling on sidewalks in yards and in streets and in masses
3426,3240-131232-0030,but none were found on roofs or any other elevation above ground and none were seen to fall if you prefer to believe that the snakes had always been there or had been upon the ground in the first place and that it was only that something occurred to call special attention to them
3427,3240-131232-0031,in the streets of memphis january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven why that's sensible that's the common sense that has been against us from the first it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not
3428,3240-131232-0032,and had not been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses in the first place if we try to accept that these snakes had been raised from some other part of this earth's surface in a whirlwind if we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them
3429,3240-131232-0033,stones fence rails limbs of trees say that the snakes occupied the next gradation and would be the next to fall
3430,3240-131232-0034,again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes
3431,3240-131232-0035,i don't know how many to a den hundreds maybe but according to the account of this occurrence in the new york times there were thousands of them alive from one foot to eighteen inches in length
3432,3240-131232-0036,records the fall and says that there were thousands of them the usual whirlwind explanation is given but in what locality snakes exist in such abundance is yet a mystery this matter of enormousness of numbers
3433,3240-131232-0037,suggests to me something of a migratory nature but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january if ever as to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough

3437,3240-131231-0000,attempts to preserve the system that small frogs and toads for instance never have fallen from the sky but were on the ground in the first place or that there have been such falls up from one place in a whirlwind and down in another
3438,3240-131231-0001,were there some especially froggy place near europe as there is an especially sandy place the scientific explanation would of course be that all small frogs falling from the sky in europe come from that center of frogeity to start with
3439,3240-131231-0002,i'd like to emphasize something that i am permitted to see because i am still primitive or intelligent or in a state of maladjustment
3440,3240-131231-0003,of a fall of tadpoles from the sky as to there in the first place
3441,3240-131231-0004,the writer says that all observers were mistaken that the frogs or toads must have fallen from trees or other places overhead tremendous number of little toads one or two months old
3442,3240-131231-0005,that were seen to fall from a great thick cloud that appeared suddenly in a sky that had been cloudless august eighteen o four near toulouse france according to a letter from professor pontus to m arago
3443,3240-131231-0006,many instances of frogs that were seen to fall from the sky
3444,3240-131231-0007,as to having been there in the first place
3445,3240-131231-0008,july thirtieth eighteen thirty eight
3446,3240-131231-0009,little toads found in a desert after a rainfall notes and queries
3447,3240-131231-0010,to start with i do not deny positively the conventional explanation of up and down i think that there may have been such occurrences i omit many notes that i have upon indistinguishables
3448,3240-131231-0011,in the london times july fourth eighteen eighty three there is an account of a shower of twigs and leaves and tiny toads in a storm upon the slopes of the apennines these may have been the ejectamenta of a whirlwind i add however
3449,3240-131231-0012,that i have notes upon two other falls of tiny toads in eighteen eighty three one in france and one in tahiti also of fish in scotland but in the phenomenon of the apennines the mixture seems to me to be typical of the products of a whirlwind
3450,3240-131231-0013,the other instances seem to me to be typical of something like migration their great numbers and their homogeneity over and over in these annals of the damned occurs the datum of segregation
3451,3240-131231-0014,but a whirlwind is thought of as a condition of chaos quasi chaos
3452,3240-131231-0015,monthly weather review july eighteen eighty one a small pond in the track of the cloud was sucked dry the water being carried over the adjoining fields together with a large quantity of soft mud which was scattered over the ground for half a mile around
3453,3240-131231-0016,but here are the circumstances of a scoop in the exclusionist imagination there is no regard for mud debris from the bottom of a pond floating vegetation loose things from the shores but a precise picking out of frogs only
3454,3240-131231-0017,of all instances i have that attribute the fall of small frogs or toads to whirlwinds only one definitely identifies or places the whirlwind also as has been said before a pond going up would be quite as interesting as frogs coming down
3455,3240-131231-0018,whirlwinds we read of over and over but where and what whirlwind it seems to me that anybody who had lost a pond would be heard from in symons meteorological magazine
3456,3240-131231-0019,a fall of small frogs near birmingham england june thirtieth eighteen ninety two is attributed to a specific whirlwind but not a word as to any special pond that had contributed
3457,3240-131231-0020,and something that strikes my attention here is that these frogs are described as almost white i'm afraid there is no escape for us we shall have to give to civilization upon this earth some new worlds places with white frogs in them
3458,3240-131231-0021,in spite of all we think we know of the accelerative velocity of falling bodies and have propagated why the exotic becomes the indigenous or from the strangest of places we'd expect the familiar or
3459,3240-131231-0022,if hosts of living frogs have come here from somewhere else every living thing upon this earth may ancestrally have come from somewhere else i find that i have another note upon a specific hurricane
3460,3240-131231-0023,after one of the greatest hurricanes in the history of ireland some fish were found as far as fifteen yards from the edge of a lake have another this is a good one for the exclusionists fall of fish in paris said that a neighboring pond had been blown dry
3461,3240-131231-0024,date not given but i have seen it recorded somewhere else the best known fall of fishes from the sky is that which occurred at mountain ash
3462,3240-131231-0025,february eleventh eighteen fifty nine the editor of the zoologist
3463,3240-131231-0026,having published a report of a fall of fishes writes i am continually receiving similar accounts of frogs and fishes but in all the volumes of the zoologist i can find only two reports of such falls there is nothing to conclude
3464,3240-131231-0027,other than that hosts of data have been lost because orthodoxy does not look favorably upon such reports the monthly weather review records several falls of fishes in the united states
3465,3240-131231-0028,nevertheless the treatment by the zoologist of the fall reported from mountain ash is fair first appears
3466,3240-131231-0029,vicar of abedare asserting that the fall had occurred chiefly upon the property of mister nixon of mountain ash
3467,3240-131231-0030,of the british museum bristling with exclusionism writes that some of these fishes which had been sent to him alive were very young minnows he says on reading the evidence it seems to me most probably only a practical joke
3468,3240-131231-0031,the editor says that one was a minnow and that the rest were sticklebacks he says that doctor gray's explanation is no doubt right but
3469,3240-131231-0032,he publishes a letter from another correspondent who apologizes for opposing so high an authority as doctor gray but says that he had obtained some of these fishes from persons who lived at a considerable distance apart
3470,3240-131231-0033,or considerably out of range of the playful pail of water according to the annual register
3471,3240-131231-0034,the fishes themselves had fallen by pailfuls if these fishes were not upon the ground in the first place we base our objections to the whirlwind explanation upon two data that they fell in no such distribution as one could attribute to the discharge of a whirlwind
3472,3240-131231-0035,that ten minutes later another fall of fishes occurred upon this same narrow strip of land even arguing that a whirlwind may stand still axially it discharges tangentially wherever the fishes came from it does not seem thinkable
3473,3240-131231-0036,that some could have fallen and that others could have whirled even a tenth of a minute then falling directly after the first to fall because of these evil circumstances the best adaptation was to laugh the whole thing off
3474,3240-131231-0037,very young minnows had been caught up in the london times march second eighteen fifty nine is a letter from mister aaron roberts curate of saint peter's carmathon in this letter
3475,3240-131231-0038,but there is some question of species i think myself that they were minnows and sticklebacks some persons thinking them to be sea fishes placed them in salt water according to mister roberts
3476,3240-131231-0039,some were placed in fresh water these seemed to thrive well as to narrow distribution we are told that the fishes fell in and about the premises of mister nixon it was not observed at the time that any fish fell in any other part of the neighborhood
3477,3240-131231-0040,save in the particular spot mentioned in the london times march tenth eighteen fifty nine vicar griffith writes an account the roofs of some houses were covered with them
3478,3240-131231-0041,in this letter it is said that the largest fishes were five inches long and that these did not survive the fall report of the british association
3479,3240-131231-0042,the evidence of the fall of fish on this occasion was very conclusive a specimen of the fish was exhibited
3480,3240-131231-0043,leirus gasterosteus is the stickleback altogether i think we have not a sense of total perdition
3481,3240-131231-0044,in which were thousands of fishes four or five inches long some of which covered roofs of houses and some of which remained ten minutes in the air by way of contrast we offer our own acceptance that the bottom of a super geographical pond had dropped out
3482,3240-131231-0045,i have a great many notes upon the fall of fishes despite the difficulty these records have in getting themselves published but i pick out the instances that especially relate to our super geographical acceptances
3483,3240-131231-0046,that have fallen with a distribution narrower than is attributable to a whirlwind that have fallen for a considerable length of time upon the same narrow area of land these three factors indicate somewhere not far aloft
3484,3240-131231-0047,a region of inertness to this earth's gravitation of course however a region that by the flux and variation of all things must at times be susceptible but afterward our heresy will bifurcate
3485,3240-131231-0048,in amiable accommodation to the crucifixion it'll get i think but so impressed are we with the datum that though there have been many reports of small frogs that have fallen from the sky
3486,3240-131231-0049,that to these circumstances another adjustment must be made apart from our three factors of indication an extraordinary observation is the fall of living things without injury to them
3487,3240-131231-0050,something else apart from our three main interests is a phenomenon that looks like what one might call an alternating series of falls of fishes whatever the significance may be

3494,3240-131231-0057,disregarding serial significance or mechanical unintelligent repulsive reflex is that the fishes of india did not fall from the sky that they were found upon the ground after torrential rains because streams had overflowed and had then receded
3495,3240-131231-0058,in the region of inertness that we think we can conceive of or a zone that is to this earth's gravitation very much like the neutral zone of a magnet's attraction we accept that there are bodies of water and also clear spaces bottoms of ponds dropping out
3496,3240-131231-0059,remain and dry or even putrefy then sometimes falling by atmospheric dislodgment after a tremendous deluge of rain one of the heaviest falls on record
3497,3240-131231-0060,july twenty fifth eighteen fifty
3498,3240-131231-0061,the word found is agreeable to the repulsions of the conventionalists and their concept of an overflowing stream but according to doctor buist some of these fishes were found on the tops of haystacks ferrel
3499,3240-131231-0062,tells of a fall of living fishes some of them having been placed in a tank where they survived that occurred in india about twenty miles south of calcutta september twentieth eighteen thirty nine a witness of this fall says
3500,3240-131231-0063,the most strange thing which ever struck me was that the fish did not fall helter skelter or here and there but they fell in a straight line not more than a cubit in breadth
3501,3240-131231-0064,that according to testimony taken before a magistrate a fall occurred february nineteenth eighteen thirty near feridpoor india of many fishes of various sizes some whole and fresh and others mutilated and putrefying
3502,3240-131231-0065,or to those who hold out for segregation in a whirlwind or that objects say twice as heavy as others would be separated from the lighter we point out that some of these fishes were twice as heavy as others in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal
3503,3240-131231-0066,some of the fish were fresh but others were rotten and without heads among the number which i got five were fresh and the rest stinking and headless they remind us of his grace's observation of some pages back
3504,3240-131231-0067,according to doctor buist some of these fishes weighed one and a half pounds each and others three pounds a fall of fishes at futtepoor india may sixteenth eighteen thirty three they were all dead and dry
3505,3240-131231-0068,a correspondent writes from the dove marine laboratory cuttercoats england that at hindon a suburb of sunderland august twenty fourth nineteen eighteen hundreds of small fishes identified as sand eels had fallen
3506,3240-131231-0069,again the small area about sixty by thirty yards the fall occurred during a heavy rain that was accompanied by thunder
3507,3240-131231-0070,but by no visible lightning the sea is close to hindon but if you try to think of these fishes having described a trajectory in a whirlwind from the ocean consider this remarkable datum that
3508,3240-131231-0071,according to witnesses the fall upon this small area occupied ten minutes i cannot think of a clearer indication of a direct fall from a stationary source and
3509,3240-131231-0072,the fish were all dead and indeed stiff and hard when picked up immediately after the occurrence by all of which i mean that we have only begun to pile up our data of things that fall from a stationary source overhead
3510,3240-131231-0073,we'll have to take up the subject from many approaches before our acceptance which seems quite as rigorously arrived at as ever has been a belief can emerge from the accursed i don't know how much the horse and the barn will help us to emerge
3511,3240-131231-0074,but if ever anything did go up from this earth's surface and stay up those damned things may have monthly weather review may eighteen seventy eight in a tornado in wisconsin may twenty third eighteen seventy eight
3512,3240-131231-0075,a barn and a horse were carried completely away and neither horse nor barn nor any portion of either have since been found after that which would be a little strong were it not for a steady improvement in our digestions that i note as we go along
3513,3240-131231-0076,there is little of the bizarre or the unassimilable in the turtle that hovered six months or so over a small town in mississippi monthly weather review may eighteen ninety four
3514,3240-131231-0077,fell a small piece of alabaster that at bovina eight miles from vicksburg fell a gopher turtle they fell in a hailstorm this item was widely copied at the time for instance nature
3515,3240-131231-0078,as to discussion not a word or science and its continuity with presbyterianism data like this are damned at birth the weather review does sprinkle or baptize or attempt to save this infant
3516,3240-131231-0079,but in all the meteorological literature that i have gone through after that date not a word except mention once or twice the editor of the review says
3517,3240-131231-0080,an examination of the weather map shows that these hailstorms occur on the south side of a region of cold northerly winds and were but a small part of a series of similar storms
3518,3240-131231-0081,of all incredibilities that we have to choose from i give first place to a notion of a whirlwind pouncing upon a region
3519,3240-131231-0082,this time the other mechanical thing there in the first place cannot rise in response to its stimulus it is resisted in that these objects were coated with ice month of may in a southern state if a whirlwind at all
3520,3240-131231-0083,there must have been very limited selection there is no record of the fall of other objects but there is no attempt in the review to specify a whirlwind these strangely associated things were remarkably separated they fell eight miles apart
3521,3240-131231-0084,then as if there were real reasoning they must have been high to fall with such divergence or one of them must have been carried partly horizontally eight miles farther than the other but either supposition argues for power more than that of a local whirl or gust
3522,3240-131231-0085,or argues for a great specific disturbance of which there is no record for the month of may eighteen ninety four
3523,8098-278278-0000,by mac a'rony you do ill to teach the child such words he teaches him to kick and to hack which they'll do fast enough of themselves and to call horum fye upon you
3524,8098-278278-0001,merry wives of windsor frequently since crossing the mississippi pod had received letters from proud parents informing him that they had named their latest boy after him
3525,8098-278278-0002,at that time in cripple creek several boys ranging from a day to six weeks old whose destinies were thought to be promising were afflicted with my master's ponderous name
3526,8098-278278-0003,a little green eyed irish girl five days old was named pythagorina podina mulgarry
3527,8098-278278-0004,the happy father called personally on pod and asked him to act as godfather at the baptismal service sunday afternoon the impressive ceremony took place at the cabin of miss pythagorina
3528,8098-278278-0005,as the aged grandmother wished to witness it pod said he was somewhat embarrassed about attending since he had forgotten almost all his latin
3529,8098-278278-0006,but he arranged with one of the pall bearers to give him nudges and kicks when it was expected of him to make a response and so he got through fairly well better than the kid did he said the babe was an unruly child
3530,8098-278278-0007,and kicked so frantically when the priest took her in his arms that two flatirons were tied to its feet to keep them down it was simply nervousness because the high altitude affected the child's nerves
3531,8098-278278-0008,there was great excitement and surprise because the flatirons didn't float and the undertaker or what you call em overturned the barrel of water and set everybody afloat drenching the sponsors and guests
3532,8098-278278-0009,pod said the scene was without a parallel he was soaked to his equator the half christened half drowned pythagorina podina was picked up from the flood with a tablespoon and the ceremony finished
3533,8098-278278-0010,then she was rolled on the barrel to get all the water out of her and put to bed with hot flatirons at her feet to prevent croup and mumps then the wake broke up i don't believe the child understood a word that the priest said
3534,8098-278278-0011,pod didn't that night he got up a fine supper and invited some old friends he bought a big porterhouse steak thick and tender and personally broiled it on his patent folding stove
3535,8098-278278-0012,just when everything was on the table and the guests were finding stones and tin plates to sit on don not having had a thing to eat for an hour coolly pulled the hot steak off the platter and dropped it on the ground
3536,8098-278278-0013,pod didn't say anything though but just forked it on to the platter and scraped off some dry grass and a sliver and a bug and carved it up
3537,8098-278278-0014,the ladies looked at the dog and then at pod not knowing which to thank then feeling sensitive about accepting the best part of the steak insisted upon pod's having one of their pieces and coonskin the other
3538,8098-278278-0015,after supper don feasted on the tougher parts of the steak and we donks were fed the scraps of potatoes and bread and tin tomato and peach cans when the banquet was over the guests went home
3539,8098-278278-0016,about six o'clock we went into camp on the margin of a famous petrified forest pod objected at first because of the scarcity of fire wood
3540,8098-278278-0017,lots of petrified wood chips lying around i remarked and they'll last ordinary wood burns up too fast bright idea exclaimed pod and coonskin went to work gathering petrified wood for the supper fire
3541,8098-278278-0018,the only trouble will be in starting the fire said pod just as soon as it's once going it ought to burn smoothly enough
3542,8098-278278-0019,coonskin's opinion didn't benefit pod much his hard wood fire wasn't very satisfactory but with some dry brush the men got the meal under way next morning we visited the noted petrified stump
3543,8098-278278-0020,measuring upwards of forty five feet in circumference several saws were imbedded in it for many futile attempts had been made to take off some slices for the denver exposition
3544,8098-278278-0021,it has been estimated by various ornithologists botanists and entomologists that the stump is millions of years old i think they were guessing at it for i couldn't see the rings
3545,8098-278278-0022,several times i had a suspicion that we had been misdirected when we came to the end of a narrow wood road i was sure of it
3546,8098-278278-0023,best to go through the woods said the valet so we were headed for the timber our tramp through the forest i cannot soon forget up and down the rocky heights through thickets of quaking asp and pine
3547,8098-278278-0024,and realized we were lost coonskin said he was an experienced woodman and would blaze the trees so we would get out again wonderful the amount of learning he had gleaned from dime novels
3548,8098-278278-0025,he lagged behind to do the blazing and pretty soon i smelt smoke the professor snuffed smells as if the woods were on fire somewhere hinted pod look behind you they are i exclaimed
3549,8098-278278-0026,and pod caught that erudite valet back woodsman in the act of setting a tree on fire with oil and matches fortunately for us the wind wasn't blowing strong
3550,8098-278278-0027,but we had to change our course some and hustle faster for the blazing trail chased us coonskin learned a new lesson and turned down the corner of the page so he'd recollect it
3551,8098-278278-0028,a board sign informed us it was simply turkey creek i couldn't see any turkeys but there was good pasturage around the hot trip through the timber made us all hungry
3552,8098-278278-0029,it was three o'clock when we donks were picketed and allowed to graze then coonskin went fishing he said he had seen some trout in the stream by supper time he had caught a nice mess
3553,8098-278278-0030,pod said he would fry the fish and went at it so enthusiastically that he forgot to put the bag of corn meal back in its place after the meal was over he began to look around for the bag it was nowhere to be found
3554,8098-278278-0031,i had eaten the corn meal and bag it was comical how those two men puzzled their brains about that missing commodity when coonskin detected some meal stamped in the ground pod pointed at me and said
3555,8098-278278-0032,that's the thief there next morning coonskin was the first to return from fishing and looked much excited when pod returned he told him he had seen huge bear tracks he was going bear hunting pod laughed at him
3556,8098-278278-0033,that was my experience in the woods of wisconsin the men at the saw mill said we should see bear in this forest
3557,8098-278278-0034,its skin would fetch fifty dollars or more let's look for bear what would you do if you saw a bear pod asked well now leave that to me said coonskin
3558,8098-278278-0035,in the first place it would be worth a hairbreadth escape to see one wild i've only seen bears in circuses or traveling chained to italians in the second place i can run i've plenty of medals for sprinting
3559,8098-278278-0036,pod went fishing that afternoon with a gun and took the whole arsenal along with him including the axe somewhere about five o'clock pod came into camp with a good mess of trout after cleaning the fish he took off his guns
3560,8098-278278-0037,and laid down on the grass and wondered if that crazy valet had run across any more bear tracks he wasn't there long when suddenly i heard yells issuing from the canyon down stream round the bend
3561,8098-278278-0038,the shouting sounded nearer every second and i soon distinguished coonskin's voice pod got up from the ground excitedly coonskin's in trouble plain enough said pod aloud to himself i must run to his aid
3562,8098-278278-0039,so he started on a trot down stream to the bend and then quickly turned falling all over himself and ran toward the cabins faster than i ever saw him run before or since
3563,8098-278278-0040,and immediately coonskin came flying into view with the biggest bear at his heels i ever want to see
3564,8098-278252-0000,much pomp and several circumstances from willoughby we went to cleveland my route through the beautiful city lay along one of the finest residence streets in america the famous euclid avenue
3565,8098-278252-0001,from there we marched to superior street where cheers greeted us on every hand the papers had heralded my advent and as in the other towns and cities
3566,8098-278252-0002,the newspaper artists had taxed their imaginations to picture pod and mac
3567,8098-278252-0003,and when i rode out on to the stage the house shook with laughter and cheers i made a short address and announced that i would sell photos of mac a'rony and his master at the door
3568,8098-278252-0004,that theatre put me way ahead financially thursday morning i called on the mayor mark hanna and senator garfield and added the autographs of all three to my album
3569,8098-278252-0005,mister garfield invited me to attend the weekly dinner and reception of the beer and skittles club that evening i went and enjoyed myself
3570,8098-278252-0006,only making thirteen miles
3571,8098-278252-0007,a mile beyond two men reminded me it was a very wintry day then a woman drove past and tossed me the comforting reminder don't you find it awfully cold i did not reply to the last two
3572,8098-278252-0008,twenty minutes later a boy from a cozy home yelled to me i had passed to some distance and did not understand it sounded like
3573,8098-278252-0009,i hesitated a moment in the biting wind then retraced my steps and called to the lad what's that you said
3574,8098-278252-0010,yelled the scamp i was mad enough to unload my winchester but i didn't
3575,8098-278252-0011,rubbed my ears and continued my journey like an ice covered volcano a mile beyond a wagon with a family in it passed me and the man said cold my friend at dusk a farmer inquired
3576,8098-278252-0012,i shouted several times before the rig stopped a fur clad head stuck out to one side and a male voice called
3577,8098-278252-0013,i ambled up put a foot on the hub of a wheel and said i simply want to say it's a cold day you as soon as he had finished i said by way of civil explanation
3578,8098-278252-0014,my dear sir do you know a hundred people have stopped me to day and told me it is cold i have tramped nearly twenty miles without stopping to warm or eat
3579,8098-278252-0015,and i resolved to let the next fellow have the same dose i have been taking half hourly all day now if you are satisfied that it is a cold day i will bid you good night
3580,8098-278252-0016,with this i returned to my companions somewhat warmer physically but cooler in spirit the hotel in cuyahoga falls received us most hospitably
3581,8098-278252-0017,i never shall forget the kindnesses of its landlady the village dates back to pioneer days it is built on the hunting grounds of the old cuyahoga indians monday march first at twelve thirty p m
3582,8098-278252-0018,waving hats and arms and calling to me to be their guest i was puzzled to know which invitation to accept while deliberating one of the landlords approached and taking my arm led me to his comfortable hostelry
3583,8098-278252-0019,where he royally entertained me and my animals the pageant that celebrated the departure of william mc kinley to the seat of government was a fair estimate of the regard in which his fellow citizens held him
3584,8098-278252-0020,canton did him honor i witnessed the leave taking at his house his ride to the train in the coach drawn by four greys under escort of a band
3585,8098-278252-0021,and heard him deliver his farewell address from the rear platform of his private car i spent wednesday night in massillon and next morning returned to canton to take some interior photographs of mc kinley's home
3586,8098-278252-0022,i was successful beyond my hopes and expectations securing fine pictures of his study and parlor the president's inauguration at washington called forth a deafening demonstration
3587,8098-278252-0023,cannon boomed steam whistles shrieked and the citizens shouted and hurrahed and i was glad mac was not with me to add his salute
3588,8098-278252-0024,i saw a meadow lark on the first of march this day i heard blue birds and robins singing gaily it looked as though spring had come to stay i expected that day to reach dalton only eight miles distant
3589,8098-278252-0025,that once i was compelled to crawl along the top of a rail fence two hundred feet and more and drag my jackass at dusk i had covered only three miles then i sought lodgings
3590,8098-278252-0026,a store loomed into view shortly i was elated according to the sign over the entrance the younger generation was the ruling power it read hezekiah brimley and father
3591,8098-278252-0027,i made for hez he said the town hadn't reached the hotel stage of development yet but that he would gladly take me in provided i'd sleep with his clerk in the garret
3592,8098-278252-0028,i found the store full of loungers who patronized the chairs soap and starch boxes mackerel kits and counter forming a silent circle round a towering stove in the center
3593,8098-278252-0029,the village treasurer wore a boiled shirt and brass collar buttons but no collar or coat his companions were generally attired in flannel shirts of different hues and patterns
3594,8098-278252-0030,and felt boots encased in heavy overshoes these rural men eyed me with suspicion until i mentioned mac a'rony then there was a rush to the door as it swung open in leaped my great dog
3595,8098-278252-0031,came several queries in a bunch no i said he has killed a bull chewed up a ram made thanks giving mince meat of several dogs chased a pig up a tree
3596,8098-278252-0032,and only this morning ate two chickens and a duck and chased a farmer into his hay loft but he doesn't bite my statement had a sensational effect on the assembly who one by one sneaked out of the door
3597,8098-278252-0033,leaving hez and his odd guest alone as soon as the junior member hez's father came in hez took my animals to the shed and fed them and told me to help myself to the best in the store
3598,8098-278252-0034,a pint of corned oysters light weight some crackers and leaf lard to take the place of butter and a cake of bitter chocolate i left a few things unmolested such as soap
3599,8098-278252-0035,to be good chocolate must be well dissolved no pot was to be had save a flower pot with a hole in the bottom a great idea popped into my head
3600,8098-278252-0036,did you ever try it if not don't let your curiosity get the better of you chocolate belongs to the bean family and the bean is a very treacherous thing
3601,8098-278252-0037,chocolate bean castor oil bean pork bean and all kinds i first ate the cake of chocolate then some sugar and drank two dippersful of hot water then shook myself
3602,8098-278252-0038,that mixture might suit my stomach i thought but it doesn't delight my palate i felt i had eaten a heavy meal unwittingly and sat down to digest it i hadn't sat long before i felt myself swelling
3603,8098-278252-0039,something within was sizzling and brewing and steaming gas and steam choked me i was sure there was going to be a demonstration in my honor that i had not bargained for the yeast cake came to mind then i knew the cause
3604,8098-278252-0040,after which i excused myself to the clerk and went to bed and dreamed i was being cremated alive
3605,8098-275181-0000,their sharp cur like barks used often to rouse us and of a dark evening we would hear them out in the fields mousing around the stone heaps making a queer squeaking sound like a mouse
3606,8098-275181-0001,to call the real mice out of their grass nests inside the stone heaps this indeed is a favorite trick of reynard at the time of my story my friend tom edwards ten years of age
3607,8098-275181-0002,and myself were in the turkey business equal partners we owned a flock of thirty one turkeys these roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of tom's house in the very top of it
3608,8098-275181-0003,and by day they wandered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beech nuts which were very plentiful that fall all went well till the last week in october when on taking the census one morning a turkey was found to be missing
3609,8098-275181-0004,the thirty one had become thirty since nightfall the previous evening it was the first one we had lost we proceeded to look for traces our suspicions were divided
3610,8098-275181-0005,tom thought it was the twombly boys nefarious sam in particular i thought it might have been an owl but under the tree in the soft dirt where the potatoes had recently been dug we found fox tracks
3611,8098-275181-0006,and two or three ominous little wads of feathers with one long tail feather adrift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butternut had a fit perhaps
3612,8098-275181-0007,and a casualty such as turkey raisers are unavoidably heirs to and we bore our loss with resignation we were glad to remember that turkeys did not often fall off their roosts
3613,8098-275181-0008,this theory received something of a check when our flock counted only twenty nine the next morning there were more fox tracks and a great many more feathers under the tree this put a new and altogether ugly aspect on the matter
3614,8098-275181-0009,no algebra was needed to figure the outcome of the turkey business at this rate together with our prospective profits in the light of this new fact it was clear that something must be done and at once too
3615,8098-275181-0010,or ruin would swallow up the poultry firm rightly or wrongly we attributed the mischief to a certain silver gray that had several times been seen in the neighborhood that autumn
3616,8098-275181-0011,it would take far too much space to relate in detail the plans we laid and put in execution to catch that fox during the next two weeks i recollect that we set three traps for him to no purpose
3617,8098-275181-0012,had succeeded in getting two more of the turkeys heroes it is said are born of great crises this dilemma of ours developed tom's genius i'll have that fox he said when the traps failed
3618,8098-275181-0013,each a wad of fine dry grass as large as a quart box these were gathered up and filled the great basket there said he triumphantly don't them smell mousey they did certainly
3619,8098-275181-0014,they savored as strongly of mice as tom's question of bad grammar and don't foxes catch mice demanded tom confidently yes but i don't see how that's going to catch the fox i said
3620,8098-275181-0015,well look here then i'll show ye said he
3621,8098-275181-0016,and you was prowling around the fields go off now out there by that stump full of wonder and curiosity i retired to the stump tom meantime turned out the mass of nests
3622,8098-275181-0017,and with it completely covered himself the pile now resembled an enormous mouse nest or rather a small hay cock
3623,8098-275181-0018,inside the nest evidently there were mice in it and feeling my character as fox at stake i at once trotted forward then crept up and as the rustling and squeaking continued made a pounce into the grass
3624,8098-275181-0019,as i had heard it said that foxes did when mousing instantly two spry brown hands from out the nest clutched me with a most vengeful grip as a fox i struggled tremendously
3625,8098-275181-0020,then in dumb show knocked my head with a stone d'ye see now he demanded i saw but a fox would bite you i objected let him bite said tom
3626,8098-275181-0021,with the dusk we stole out into the field where the stone heaps were and where we had oftenest heard foxes bark selecting a nook in the edge of a clump of raspberry briars which grew about a great pine stump
3627,8098-275181-0022,tom lay down and i covered him up completely with the contents of the big basket he then practiced squeaking and rustling several times to be sure that all was in good trim his squeaks were perfect successes
3628,8098-275181-0023,made by sucking the air sharply betwixt his teeth now be off said tom and don't come poking around nor get in sight till you hear me holler
3629,8098-275181-0024,and being amidst nice cozy straw i presently went to sleep quite unintentionally i must have slept some time though it seemed to me but a very few minutes what woke me was a noise a sharp suppressed yelp
3630,8098-275181-0025,it took me a moment to understand where i was and why i was there a sound of scuffling and tumbling on the ground at some distance assisted my wandering wits and i rushed out of the barn and ran toward the field
3631,8098-275181-0026,as i ran two or three dull whacks came to my ear got him tom i shouted rushing up tom was holding and squeezing one of his hands with the other and shaking it violently
3632,8098-275181-0027,he said not a word and left me to poke about and stumble on the limp warm carcass of a large fox that lay near bite ye i exclaimed after satisfying myself that the fox was dead some said tom
3633,8098-275181-0028,and that was all i could get from him that night we took the fox to the house and lighted a candle it was the silver gray tom washed his bite in cold water and went to bed
3634,8098-275181-0029,his left hand was bitten through the palm and badly swollen there was also a deep bite in the fleshy part of his right arm just below the elbow several minor nips in his left leg above the knee and a ragged grab
3635,8098-275181-0030,these numerous bites however were followed by no serious ill effects the next day tom told me that the fox had suddenly plunged into the grass that he had caught hold of one of its hind legs
3636,8098-275181-0031,i just determined to have it out with him considering the fact that a fox is a very active sharp biting animal and that this was an unusually large male i have always thought tom got off very well
3637,8098-275181-0032,i do not think that he ever cared to make a fox trap of himself again however we sold the fox skin in the village and received thirteen dollars for it whereas a common red fox skin is worth no more than three dollars
3638,8098-275181-0033,how or by what wiles that fox got the turkeys out of the high butternut is a secret
